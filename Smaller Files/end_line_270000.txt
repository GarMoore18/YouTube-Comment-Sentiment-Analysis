the best smartphone display, I dont know how they keep doing this? Ever think is was because they choose not to rip off their consumers? When you pay $1000 for a phone, samsung gives you the best of the best. Pay $1000 for an iphone, and you get tech from 18 months ago...
I can't believe apple has made us pay 80 $ to get fast charging wtf apple bang out of order.
Bezel less phones are shit.
whats the earpod in 9：23？

this is what keeps me from samsung phones, the battery life is terrible no matter how much you turn things off/battery saver/auto brightness still it sucks. They are great phones but battery is not enough.
Really, not gonna call out all the UI and software they’ve blatantly ripped off Apple? And best industrial design? Please ... The fact that the fingerprint scanner is in the wrong place is evidence that their industrial design is lacking. Design is how it works, not just how it looks.
Disable all the apps your never going to use, remove some permissions from apps, turn off notifications on most apps and then you'll get good 🔋life. All Android phones out of the box are pretty bad. I only use Android so don't call me an 🍎 fan.
Lol the blow up joke 😂 😂 😂
Hey Guys, Im the guy that was wearing the EverybodyFights shirt & I'm coming here to give my side of the story as to what happened. A lot of people think they know but have no idea how the altercation went down or what was said before the KO actually took place. I was on my way to work at the gym early in the morning, & I got on the train I was writing music minding my own business when I heard this guy talking shit about my hair, I didn't think much of it, til I took my headphones out & said I had nice hair, I responded that's not what you said, to which he got up & started saying I looked like a bitch because I have long hair, He kept inching closer to me so I got in my stance and threw my hands up just in case of anything & responded if I'm a bitch why don't you fight me ? To which he responded I don't wanna kill you, he kept on talking and I kept responding you're all talk and as I got off the train he followed me upstairs where the knockout happened, He started trying to put his hands in my face so I started parrying and slapping his hand away, I kept warning him don't get closer or I'm gonna hit you, he eventually got in my face & I hit him with a short right hook that folded him, I didn't wanna jump on him and hit him anymore because the reality is I didn't wanna hurt the guy, I simply was defending myself, he eventually got up and made his way upstairs where I was trying to again avoid confrontation, He threw his hands again and came at me so i squared up & got in my stance, once he realized he couldn't fight with me hands wise, he started pulling my hair this is where I started throwing uppercuts inside & once he started yanking my hair, I slammed him against the wall & started bashing his head against it & hitting him with right hands (the crowd was blocking the view) from there I got him in a guillotine choke with the intention of putting him to sleep and going to work, he slipped out after a couple seconds so I full mounted him & had my left hand on his throat while getting ready to strike with the right, I caught him with 1 right then the cops finally showed up. There was 3 witnesses (thank you whoever you are) that defended me as the cops would have taken me in otherwise, nonetheless I'm a musical artist who really don't look to fight anybody, you can follow my page @ZayGreedo thank you 💪🏽
Hair pulling......Lame
White  dude kick his ass really all black dude was pull hair like a bitch.
dude was pulling hair lol
Every Body Fights
Did you stick around as a witness to give your side of the story to the police, or did you run away?
WTF WITH THE PEOPLE NOT STOPING THE FIGHT? ARE YOU GUYS REALLY THAT RETARDED IN AMERICA?
This is Metal Vs. Rap materialized.
This nigga knocked the poor Asian lady shoe off😂😂
The police takes the victim first, after they helped no one. Filthy pigs.
Shame on all the cowards filming and getting a thrill out of it. Nobody does anything. A bunch of bloody cowards. Police, Police. They cry like little kids.
americans lol i'm dying
Hahahaha hair pulling like a bitch. Weak.
What a bitch trying to pull his hair!!..that nock out yo!! That made my day:)\nI don't understand why people in your country don't try and stop shit like this?? I always try and break shit up like this, but if they don't want to split,and want to have a go at me,then someone is definitely going to kiss the floor!:).
The real GOAT is the woman who lost her shoe https://youtu.be/VLdTVexvJ5Q?t=2m15s
You deserve respect here. Rightfully and successfully defended yourself and he got what he deserved. He's lucky you were pulled off as you had full mount and he would have got seriously injured once you freed your hair from his grip.  Hope he learned a lesson and doesn't pull this shit with anyone else in the future.
fuck man.. this has one good shot then it looks like grand theft auto NPCs fighting lol shit
The guy with the long hair is actually a music artist IG: @Zaygreedo
The long haired guy is actually a personal friend of mine. He was looking for no trouble and somehow trouble found him. He’s a rapper and a boxer. His name is @zaygreedo on SoundCloud.
VERYBODY FIGHT GOT SKILLS
loooool
It look to me like they both like to fight.  I read what you said but I didn't see either one trying to avoid a fight.  I think it was just two idiots that wanted some attention.
The hippy should have watched the UFC. Once you knock the guy out, you have to keep pounding him until you're sure he's stay down when you walk away.
I think I went to high school with Everybody Fights.\n\nFucker was always fighting with everybody, even me.
lol American trying to stop players from taking a knee but have no problem standing by and watching shit like this
lol the guy recording is so beta... everybody fights means life is a fight that everybody is in. training martial arts teaches u that, and that's also why he was the passive one.
Most people wear shirts like rip curl or MAGA but rarely actually surf or Make America Great Again\n\nKill yourself, faggot.
I love that lady😂😂😂 Leave her alone she is not offending me
To tell the truth it's her LIFE!!!!!
why do the black people in the show get angry when they saw her\n\n\n\n\na lot of black women bleach their skin
5:15 that girl looks crazy as fuck it's a lot of fool ass black people in that audience I would never want to be considered as them 😂😂 I wouldnt mind being brown but I wouldn't say I'm black or African fuck that we are not the same ... I can brown all day but on my applications Caucasian ... Unless I feel they have some type of ethic ratio I'll put mixed race 😂
The lady is so dumb u cant jus become black cuz u change color & u look hella fucked up barbies dont have big nasty boobies that look fake and neither does Pamela not like that
she has the right to do whatever she wants with her body. She seems very sweet but I definitely think she suffers from a mental illness
I understand what she his doing is crazy, but the audience is wrong for acting like that🙄 you can obviously see that she doesn't understand the controversy. I feel like the people who are offended probably just don't like white people regardless.
OMG 😲 she's even wearing a black girls rock necklace. She's a troll. She thinks being black is only about how we look, she doesn't know the struggle. \nAlso she has psychological issues. \nWell I hope she loves Africa when she goes though. \n\nPlus that guy in the grey is doing the most!
I mean, she looks black and unfortunately - people are going to treat her differently because of it. How is this any different from Indians flaunting black culture, even though they're South Asian? How is this different from black people who pass, like Wentworth Miller? \n\nI still think she's got a lot to learn about black culture, but I doubt anybody in Germany or in the US would see her on the street and assume she was a white woman.
No, your not black. You look like a fucking dumpster. Black skin ain't a fucking fad. Proud owner like you just bought a dog or something.
im sorry but you where pretty before yiy turn this
This woman is a walking minstrel show. What the serious fuck is going on?! 🤦🏾‍♀️
The facial expressions of the crowd got me DDDYYYYYYYIIIINNNGGGGGGGGGGGG
She came on the botch show with her weirdass boyfriend
White people in the audience are so uncomfortable XD Lmao
She is so ugly.
What nobody is asking is ,,where did the melanin she was injected with come from??? Ask yourself🤔🤔🤔
That man in the crowd was dying 😂😂😂
Michael Jackson is still a Nig*er
I don't mean to offend anyone but I like how most of the audience is black their reaction when Martina said she was a black person, PRICELESS
Anyone else thinking this will be woahvicky in 2021???? She will have the injections in no time to “ prove “ she’s a black girl 🤢
She's ugly as black. She was pretty in original and white with boobs.
Homeboy at 0:45 to the left. His face = priceless
Does God really exist or is he scared of what he created
She may have black skin but shes still white. My skin is white as fuck and im mixed as hell. Race inst skin deep bitch learn that
Prime example of light bitches wanting to be us black girls
Woahvicky would be proud of her.
She'll want to be white again once she gets pulled over by a cop for the first time..
I'm an African American woman. I'm not intimidated or offended by this woman wanting to be black. I'm actually amused that you love us that much. Most of us don't even love one another. We're killing one another and we're jealous of one another for no reason!!! But here you are so infatuated with the color of our skin, that you changed your own. Wow I'd like to give you a hug!!!
Shes a beautiful black woman. No one can deny it, shes beautiful african queen.
Well just like there are transexuals there are transracials. So If a tranny gets called a woman now in society then why do people get offended if someone changes race and wants to be black? That's pretty double standard-ish. I do feel bad for her cause she seems like she wants to find herself. But so do m to f and f to m trannies which makes me think. This is more proof that trannies have a mental disorder. They are just pushed as oppressed and softened in the view of the public but this lady causes outrage. If trans people are being accepted and called by their pronouns then why not accept her? Again she's wrong but then so are trannies.
People are dying from tumors and this chick is testing life and death for fun -_- .... it's all great, I'm not against plastic surgery but come on... something is going on.
Wtf this is disgusting shit, I throw up a little inside when she'd walked down those stairs .
Im more concerned about her breasts than her colour of skin...
I hate the fact that black people are offended by this, this transformation makes her feel better so just let her be, I'm tired of the fact that every black person act like they really going through some stuff everytime a person of a different ethnicity wants to be black, it's played out yall just being extra now
Food for thaught doe.........if she shot me in the thorax, I feel like telling a cop I was shot by a white woman would not be very contributing for the investigation. No points being proven here, just saying lmao
I am black and she doesn't offend me I just feel bad about her breast!!
they played the fuck out of this poor girl, it's her body if she wants to be black then let her she wasn't doing it to offend anyone and obviously she has a sense of admiration for us so why all the hate? Also why did they fill that audience with almost all black people they set this poor girl up and i bet you they told them to act outraged before hand and during the breaks because i've been in the maury audience before and it's a sham there is a guy standing on the side with cue cards telling you how to react and when to clap/boo. I feel really bad for this girl she came on to try and explain herself but was treested like a circus animal/ court jester
She is not black! Being black is more than just the color of your skin and wearing hair extensions! This shit is just outrageous and mocks black people at the highest level!SMMFH💩
ole dude @ 0:30 and 5:53 was deadass my two moods the entire time lmao 😂😂💀🤦🏽‍♀️
I fucks with it good luck and God bless
Technically race is a combination of characteristics that are commonly grouped to together creating a category solely based on appearance. So race is purely visual and would only be skin deep in my eyes at least since race has no affect on behaviour.
Lmao it’s like the inverse of the white chicks movie
I don't agree with what she did but at the same time. The audience was a little harsh on her at first. I think she just doesn't understand
hey if michael Jackson can change his skin colour why can not she
I bet you half the people on here guys and girls would still hit it!!!! if they got the opportunity!!!!!!
Her accent is annoying as hell
Being a black person kinda is skin deep. Your just a different colored person
She was million times prittier before.. i think she needs help, that's not normal
I am black and this is bullshit
S/O to the woman at 5:12 showin that natural hair 😭💀💁🏾
She looks horrible and will never truly be black
Waste of money you still look like shit literally 💩You wanted to look black but all you really did was look like a klingon from star trek. 😆
identity crisis at its worst.....
Who cares. Do you
You can change you skin but not your race.
sad to see how a girl started soo beautiful could become so fucking ugly. jesus christ
Wow, I never even knew there was such a thing? I wonder if the injections wear off?
Black is in blood not just skin
her boobs look so bad and un natrual
She's hideous, her boobs are horrendous and very low on her chest.
she should try to have a mixed-race baby with a white man.
you can't change your race. you can change your citizenship. this lady is stupid. she was beautiful before but let her insecurities take over.
I think she needs therapy to work threw whatever it is she  is going thru/has been thru.
I think peoples reactions are horrible. People say white people feel they are better in some way. But here is a woman who admired black culture and skin so much she wanted to be a part of it. And even though she doesn't know the culture shock is proud to start her journey and try to learn things. I think a language barrier caused part of that but to me it seems being English is my second language that she is eager to learn more especially when she mentioned the food and feeling happier inside .... This is no different than when a person transitions gender because they  feel happier inside  as that gender. Ingnorance in spades.
She ain't hurting nobody but herself why tf are y'all judging her
The racists were in the audience, despite race being an irrelevant social construct.
Most black persons bleach their skin all the time to look white especially where I live so what if a white person wants to look black even if she looks creepy asf😌
These black people are getting so offended by her lmao but if a white person turned black ... MICHAEL JACKSON ... it's ok lolz 😂 she is disgusting though
I know that’s a wig but Bitch could of least made it look nicer .
I'm black, and if she loves our black skin, then I love it. Black is beautiful...
Being black is not about our skin color. You whites/European have it all messed up. Our culture,music(hip hop and jazz and soul), and our history is what make us black. Although our skin color is different from yours it's not just that that shows the differences between us. Blacks were inferior back then we were treated as less thans. You guys didn't want to be\nus before but now you do it doesn't make sense. Kylie Jenner has big lips and now all girls want them when black girls have been walking around with big lips for quite a long time. Kim Kardashian has a big ass but black girls have had voluptuous bodies for a long time. We've worked hard to come up and now you whites are even trying to steal our skin color. Yes it's beautiful and it protects us from the harsh rays of the sun But can we please keep at least one thing for ourselves. Please?
This bitch is married???? How tf am I single???
She can be whatever she wants
Has everyone forgot how Michael Jackson basically changed his whole race to Caucasian? And everyone still loved him, he didn't learn white culture etc he just had serious mental health problems, this woman might be the same but I wouldn't say she's offending anyone ? I'm not offended mj wanted to be white ? It's kind of a compliment although I sill feel sorry for them.
Lil kim looks a mess lol
WTF SICK WOMAN👱🏼‍♀️👱🏿‍♀️👱🏿‍♀️👱🏻‍♀️

Est ce que tu pourrais faire un tuto makeup de fenty beauty de rihanna
Hey, si tu veux un IPhone x, vient participer à notre concours IPhone x.
Bonsoir, franchement je regarde tes vidéos et je pense que pour tes problèmes d’acné ça sert à rien de mettre des produits chimiques, achète de l’huile de tea tree et de l’huile de nigelle sur Aroma Zone met de l’huile nigelle avec des gouttes d’huile de tea tree sur un coton, met le sur ton visage tout les soirs et tu verras des résultats rien de mieux que le naturel et avec de l’aloe vera la journée pour protéger ta peau de l’agression de l’air et tu verras du changement parce que produits chimiques de grande marque ça sert à rien, rien de mieux que le naturel lol
Pas de pipi du matin ? Pas de check du portable ? Pas de brossage de dents ?
C'est la photo sur Instagram ton petit déjeuner!
suis je la seul qui la trouve ennuyeuse comme pas possible  ! grr
C'est vraiment magnifique, tes cheveux, ton makeup etc mais quand tu commences à 8h le matin c'est pas la même histoire ahah
Ok ok tu m'as donnée le goût de finaliser ma video makeup pour ma chaîne!! J'ADORE L'AUTOMNE🍁\nP.S belle vidéo bisous de Montréal xx
Superbe vidéo , j'adore ta morning routine de l'automne ❤️
Tu a mis combien de pots de peinture sur toi
Très bonne vidéo t trop belle
Pourrais tu nous dire d'où vient ta housse de couette elle est trop cute 😍 🍣🍣
Une night routine spécial automne\n
Hello Mariiie, c'est quoi la référence de ton vernis à ongles steuplé ?  \nSinon j'adore ce que tu fais, keep going ! ;)
tu devrais essayer le savon d'alep. matin soir laisser poser 1min resultat efficaces tu verras car la tu mets tjrs des tonnes de produits sur le visage anti acné jcrois ca marche pas.
Tes boutons vont de mieux en mieux ☺️mais tkp il vont partir au bout d'un moment 💋attend tant que j'y suis j'étais en cours et pour les devoirs on devais faire un rédactions sur une personne que l'on admire et devine qui j'ai choisi .. Emma Watson😂😂😂mais nan tkp c'est toi et toujours toi 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😙😙😙😙😙❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️💋💋💋💋💜💜💜💜
J'adorer quand tu nous fait des morning routines  😍\nSurtout l'automne ! Je trouves qu'on peut tellement plus se lâcher :D
Superwoman <3 \nJ'adore ton look, le make up et le pull jaune *-*
Super vidéo comme toujours ♡ quel est ton vernis dans cette vidéo? Il est vraiment trop joli! Plein de bisous
Le maquillage est vraiment un art et si j'essayais de faire comme toi je ressemblerais à Bozo le clown x) En tous cas ça te va très bien même si je pense que tu pourrais te passer de tous ces artifices car tu es très bien au naturel ;) Bonne soirée !
Avec de l'acné, jamais de fonds de teint! Il faut que ta peau se régénère.
Super ces couleurs d'automne !! J'adore ! A quand une nouvelle FAQ ? :) Des bisous
Superbe vidéo j'adore !!!!! \ntu es au top ma belle! \nbisous tous pleins !
La vidéo est très bien faite, mais je trouve que tu utilises encore énormément de produits , est-ce que qu'il n'y en a pas certains sur lesquels tu peu faire l'impasse ? Je trouve ça chouette aussi que tu fasses des journées sans maquillage car tu es très belle au naturel.
Coucou Marie, je n'ai pas trop l'habitude de poster des commentaires seulement de répondre a quelques messages un peu méchant, en fait j'écris ça pour te dire que tu ne dois en aucun cas les écouter, que ce soit sur ta façon de te maquiller ou ta façon de vivre, tu es quelqu'un de parfait et de vrai. Je peux te dire que j'aime quand une personne est vraie. Depuis que tu as posté ta vidéo pour dire que tu aller être toi-même et plus faire des choses que tu n'aimes, je regarde de nouveaux tes vidéos avec plaisir ! Non, tu n'as pas grossi et au pire en quoi est-ce grave ? Non, tu ne te maquiller pas trop. \nAlors aux personnes qui jugent Marie, regardez-vous avant de parler. Même si dans le fond ce n'est pas méchant ça peut mal être interprété et le devenir.\nBref mon pavé est fini, gros bisous à Jelly, Nova et Florian sans oublier toi !\n#teamsushi. ♥♥♥
Je ne sais pas vous, mais moi je trouve qu'elle serait forte en ASMR 😊😊 Ta voix me relaxe bcp 😀❤❤. Gros bisous a toi ❤❤
ça fait plus naturel Ah ben oui mdr
En 2017 y'a encore des gens qui regardes ces ptn de morning routines gênantes mdrrr
Si YouTube n'existait pas :\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyphoenix serait maigre
Je la trouve vraiment moche sans maquillage désolé mais c'est ce que je pense il y a des youtubeuse qui sont tout aussi jolie maquiller et sans maquillage mais alors elle c'est pas le cas
je trouve qu’il y a trop de maquillage et pas assez d’activité mais si nn sa passe
Cette vidéos et bien pour commencer l'Autône.
j'adore cette vidéo , ça m'inspire ! merci  #enjoyPhoenix
T'es trop belle je t'adore et comment s'appelle ton Chat ❤️🌹🐱
Hey la petite vidéo de Superwoman au petit-déjeuner, moi aussi je fais ça ❤️❤️
Est ce que Nova et Jelly viennent te réveiller le matin ?
Ça te va super bien les cheveux attachés en demi queue pendant que tu te maquillais 👌
Bonjour. Que penses tu de la marque Younique ? Continue comme çà j'adore tes vidéo !
Coucou Marie, je te suis depuis longtemps et même si tu ne verras pas mon commentaire, je voudrais te donner la recette de quelque chose de naturel qui a carrément bien marché sur moi après environ 6ans d'acné! Je fais un mélange de 50 gouttes d'huile végétale de macadamia, 20 goûtes d'huile de tea tree, 20 gouttes de romarin verbénone et 20 gouttes d'huile de lavande, je l'applique tous les soirs sur mon visage et en quelques mois mes boutons ont diminués et aujourd'hui il ne me reste que les cicatrices qui partent aussi grâce à ce mélange, certes de temps en temps quelques boutons apparaissent mais vraiment peu. Voila continue ainsi, bonne journée!
On voit Jelly et/ou Nova dans le miroir derrière, quand tu mets ton mascara 😃🐶🐱
T'es trop belle Marie, je t'aime fort <3
L'automne est aussi ma saison preférée, j'adore les tons de ton makeup !
C'est quoi la musique?
Cette video était juste super!! Si vous pourriez venir écouter les musics présentent sur ma chaine, ce serait super merci!! :)
J'espère que tu n'arrêtera jamais t'es vidéo enjoyphenix jtm. Et
J'aime beaucoup trop ces vidéos morning/night routine, je regarde ça le soir, c'est apaisant mdrr. Et sinon.. bientôt les 3 millions! 😍
Et pourquoi tu mets pas d crème sur ton chien ?
Tu prends combien de temps à te préparer le matin ??jtm❤️💕💋🌹🦋🔥
Les boutons sont dus aux sels minéraux qui provoquent des inflammations lors de la respiration de la peau en bouchant les pores.\nL'été ou quand on a chaud, les pores sont dilatés donc il y a moins d'inflammations car ça passe mieux.\n\nMAIS FAUT PAS MANGER LES CAILLOUX !\n\nIl y a des sels minéraux un peu partout :\n\n- Les produits laitiers pasteurisés transforment le calcium animal en calcium minéral.\n- Les sels minéraux contenus dans les eaux minérales (privilégier la Mont Roucous).\n- Le sel dans les produits transformés comme la charcuterie\n- Le sel de table\n- Les minéraux d'os et de cartilage appelés collagène et présents dans les steaks hachés industriels\n- L'argile\n- Les crèmes et les produits de beauté à base d'huile minérale ou de sels minéraux\n- Les compléments alimentaires à base de minéraux\n- ...
Quelqu’un sait la référence de son lisseur svp ? ☺️\nSuperbe vidéo !!
J’adore tes bagues 😍😍 tu les as prises où ?
Tu utilise quellle marque de Fer a lisser?
Hey Marie j'aurais voulut savoir avec quel appareil tu filme tes vidéos ?
Très joli look ! J'adore la fin avec Jelly et Nova <3
J'ai trop aimé cette video Marie magnifique bsx
Salut Marie ! \nPour les boutons j'adore utiliser l'huile de coco. Alors à la base je l'utilisais pour hydrater le soir. Une noisette, on fait chauffer, on masse bien et le lendemain la peau est super douce. Et souffrant d'acné je me suis rendue compte que mes boutons partaient plus rapidement avec l'huile de coco. \nEn plus d'être excellente pour la cuisine, elle est super pour la peau et pour faire les masques pour cheveux. Tu devrais la tester !
Sans maquillage on aurait fais quoi srx??
On peut aimer plusieurs fois ? ^^\nSinon j'adore le makeup, il me fait penser à celui d'Anaëlle de la chaîne Beauty Blow !
Ça me fait trop bizarre que ya une marque aussi connue ac mon prénom 😅💪
J'ai de gros problèmes d'acné... cet elixir a-t-il était efficace pour toi ? Je désespère...
Pourquoi Marie utilise encore des produits maybeline alors qu'ils testent sur les animaux ?
Je pense que tu devrais renommer ta chaîne en Marie Lopez parce t'as l'air beaucoup plus toi même maintenant et enjoyphoenix ressemble plus à un rôle que t'avais c'est juste mon avis perso voila bisous ❤️
Au pire vous vous nettoyez juste la peau le matin et vous vous brossez les cheveux et ça suffit largement. J'adore enjoyphoenix mais je trouve qu'elle met bcp trop de produit sur elle. Elle va avoir le visage et les cheveux ravagés plus tard alors voilà...
Ton ral liquide c'est pas le bombshell hein... Ça sera sympa de donner la vrai référence et de ne pas nous induire en erreur. Si je ne savait pas la vrai teinte du bombshell je le commandais et je me serais bien faite avoir...
Tu es rayonnante avec c'est couleur de saisons. Je t'adore continue de nous faire plaisir car cela ce vois sur ton visage que toi aussi tu es heureuse.
J'aime bien ton makeup je pense même que tu aurais pu mettre un rouge à lèvre encore plus foncé
très joli look! je dois dire que ta coupe de cheveux avec les cheveux en arrière et le gros chouchou allait magnifiquement bien avec ton habillement et makeup! c'était sûrement une coiffure vite fait pour te maquiller mais ça rend hyper beau!
Mon français n’est pas excellent alors désolé pour mes fautes. Normalement, je ne fais pas des commentaires en anglais encore moins en français. Mais j'ai vu ta vidéo “pourquoi j’ai pris du poids avec les sous-titres 😅 et je pense que vous devriez savoir que tu es tellement belle. Mon dieu, comment on peut être si belle sans maquillage? Je ne sais pas comment dit-on ce mot-clic en français, mais tu es #goals #buts?
Moi aussi j'adore l'automne ;) et j'aime bcp ta video:)jaimerais bien que tu fasse une vidéo comment maquiller les yeux bleu car j'ai les yeux bleu aussi et je sais pas comment faire merci bisous
Coucou ma belle ! Top ta vidéo comme toujours… par contre ton huda beauté ça doit pas être le bombshell … je l'ai et c'est pas du tout cette couleur 😊 est ce que tu pourrais me re dire qu'elle couleur tu utilise ?😊😘
Toutes les youtubeuses adorent le muesli .. je suis la seule où le Nutella est indispensable à mon petit dej ?? 😂😂
Ton makeup et ta coiffure et ton pull et ton petit-déjeuner sont, je trouve, en parfaite harmonie avec l'automne. Bravo Marie, je t'adore 😍❤️
Hello ! J'ai commencé ma chaine YouTube récemment, si vous voulez venir voir mes vidéos et me donner votre avis n'hésitez pas <3 Evidemment, je soutiendrai toutes les filles et garçons qui me soutiendront aussi sur les réseaux, pleins de bisous

I always stand up for lecrae when people especially Christians talk down on him. Rather than hate him pray for him.
Move To The google search And Type: *gamesecrxguide instagram* This is without a doubt the only working instagram secret working from this month. Never waste the time on other software
im in boy scouts and i use this song to light my fires
So glad he made this song lol, just tellin haters to shut up xD
and people doubted him
If you don't hear this you sleep the whole album is fire he is anotied
Let me get a two piece! Hahaha!
I actually wonder if the 112 dislikes are accidental clicks?
EEeeeeeeEEEEeeekkkkkkkkkKKK!!! This track got me so hype! Love the album, Lecrae brought it on this... He navigated and captured the culture and time period in a beautiful way. This track is my favorite and straight fiiiirrreeeee! Keep doing your thing Lecrae this album is an inspiration! #letmegeta2piece
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\nJames 4:4 KJV
thank you for putting it up🙌👊
Best track of the new album!
i love this song I have every album of lecraes and Ive heard every single song he made and been featured in but this one is fire
Dude the hook scared me. Its so good
If you don't understand the it will be impossible for me to explain it to you n for to comprehend, IF your not filled with the Holy Spirit?
this is fire..secular hip hop, yall better watch out
how they shot him in the street. SHEESH these facts. 💭💭💭
I love this so much lol 😂
I WILL ONLY TELL D TRUTH...
Can't wait to see him live in LA!!
#49 on trending that's a fact. #48 other videos somehow above it that are non-factors
why does this have 90,000 views and is TRENDING???
European with that ultra perm & them soft eyes & thin lips! Rollin... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
GET IT LECRAE! You went hard.
I don't know why but I sense a trip lee vibe in this song lmao , as weird as that is lmao
Hahaaa! At the end of the song you went Gospel Gangsta on'em
That........ I will only tell the truth is annoying.
This track has a Outlast vibe 👌

Why he look like Beatlejuice from Howard Stern in the thumbnail? 🤔
i gues i can go ahead and say this song spits FACTS DEADASS 🅱\n\n\n\n\n\n\nill see myself out.......
#laughs.\nI'm almost sure some people actually picture the European Jesus with the ultra perm saying yes to their prayers when they pray.
LeCrae is rockin' that New Era sound on this Song, but he dropped that Fire on the track.
Dang Son. the Critics are Butt-Hurt In This Comment Section 4real
Can't get over this song!
We always knew Elvis stole Black artists' music, some of us just don't wanna deal with the ugliness of that...That era, that genre, and then we pretend it don't exist in 2017! Thanks 🙏🏽 lecrae for being light!
Heard this like 10 times today, too hot
Lecrea you are amazing I can't wait for your next album God bless

any rappers, singers, artists ect- check my beats if ya gotta minute
💯✊🏾
Top 🔝❤
I love lecraes truth and transparency. He is indeed my favorite artist. And i really could care less who thinks less of him. People say he's changed. I say change is good. Especially if it means you've grown as a person. Keep dropping them gems my guy.
Lecrae, I know you get a lot of criticism, but I appreciated the songs you used to make about God...now it seems to all be about you...as in you trying to express yourself rather than trying to communicate Him
Make sure you SUBSCRIBE to my channel, making original songs made all by me!!! Why you gotta cuss 'Crae?
Why listen to a Drake knock off when I can listen to the real deal?
A lot of defensiveness, hostility, and divisiveness against the church here. I don't get it.
THISSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MYYYYY GOD!!!!!!! FATHER GIVE ME THE TRUTH TO SPEAK WITH BOLDNESS AND BOLDNESS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH!!!! YEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!
This got the same background beat as back to back by drake 🤔, just little tweaks to sound the flow
love the last part ;D such a great song and album & GENRE OF MUSIC. CHICKEN SHACK!
Who says hella in a Christian song?

Ordered the iPhone 8 gold and it’s pink. Not brownish gold, not coppery gold, it’s pink. The cognac case doesn’t match, it clashes. Doesn’t match my new iPad Pro Gold. Ended up returning it without even powering it on. When I called Apple the rep ended up admitting that he had already processed 5 returns by early afternoon because it’s pink, not gold. He then guessed that there’ll be nearly 100,000 returns by the end of the day because of the pink not gold.
Apple is has run out of ideas...
I'm honestly surprised you were able to make this video without Apple taking legal action; you're essentially in possession of stolen property - you even use the word stole or stolen several times in your video. Just saying.
Since iPhone 8 and X release this year, what # will they release in 2018? ✨
I have a question, Why do people like wireless charging? I like to use my phone while it's charging. And I can't use my phone when it's sitting on the Wireless Charging Matt.
I get a free upgrade because I’ve had my 7plus since the last launch and honestly it doesn’t seem that different but hey I’ll take a free upgrade.
Everythingapplepro do u work at the Austrila Brisbane city Apple Store I think I saw you
2:48 How Did you Get Screen Saver??
It’s not his first impression he already opened it before the video because he didn’t take the plastic off
I got a 7+. Doesn’t seem like much of an upgrade to justify the price. The only way I could justify this upgrade is if you have a small 6 or 7 and want a larger phone or have a big 6 or 7 and want smaller
is this guy Canadian aboot

iPhone 7 is looking great
No headphone cord......FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK KILL ME
Apple Makes Memories Last..\nPlease hit like our video about Iphones and love....\nhttps://www.facebook.com/247AZURE/videos/1972555493002047/
Sad that so much focus on these expensive devices is about color.  It's bad enough that kids are defined by their phones these days.  the phone industry has really brainwashed our population.
What color the iphone 8 come in?
I want an iphone can anyone give me please
Its like a yogurt color on the back. And the metal bands are like a copper color. Its odd. I have it. I like it. But safe bet is white or black.
I'm happy with my rose gold iPhone 7+ I don't care for the cream color but I could see people buying it just for the coloring I personally don't have the money to waste on it
Take note that this iPhone is the same price as the 7 Plus with a doubled GB capacity, Camera with more portrait features, new sensor and 4K vids at 60fps, Most durable glass ever in a smart phone, A11 Bionic chip (6 core) new colour and more...
Ahhhh I literally just got the iPhone 7 plus a month ago. 😤😤😤
my 8 plus screen feels like its not on properly. does anyone have the same issue?
They trying to force people to get the iPhone X
I just bought the iPhone 8+ and it feels like the screen is not sitting flush with the chassis on one side so I went to T-Mobile to see if it was the same and on their display phones it  was randomly not flush on different parts of the phone has anyone experienced the same thing?
Wenatchee is beautiful. Live here, so much to do. Fishing, hiking, snowboarding etc. nice video man
Guys sub me i will sub u back right promise
Can you please give me an iphone 8 or 8+ any type for free . please reply me
do iphone 7 plus cases work for the 8 plus
I pre ordered the iphone X and the iphone 8 gold  AND IT STILL DIDN'T ARRIVE IM LOOSING MY PATIENCE
No point to buy IP8
I will exchange with my car will you
Anyone know if 7 plus cases would fit this?
My next phone is gonna be the 7 plus from the 6s plus the 8 plus is so similar not worth to upgrade to it
No matter how new your phone is there will always be a newer one. It will never end. I kept up with it when i was younger but now i see it's just pointless...
Love it my favorite
They are both the same fucking thing, people are so fucking stupid, like seriously !! Same shit, just fucking glass 😂 lmao apple out hear finessing you people ..
There is a dark mode lol
Will you ever give a giveaway ?????
fake phone i bought a 8 today and the back of mine has the text below the iphone text
Does iPhone 8 Plus have Dual Optical Stabilisation??
Can I plz have it i have an iPhone 1 still
Cool iphone 6 is released... oh wait its the iphone 8
Can I use the battery case for the 7 in the 8 ?
Iphone x and 8 are a rip off
I really want to get a new iPhone but which one should I get iPhone 7 or 8 plus and which color I really like the rose gold
What would you suggest? Should I get an 8plus or an X?
The one thing I'm curious to know, What is the refresh rate??.....Is it 120Hz like the iPad Pro 10.5 or is the iPhone 8/8Plus still at 60Hz like it has been for however long.....
Wireless charge is not include for iPhone 8? Please answer anyone
I’ve had a 6s scene it came out now I can get the i phone x😏
its fake its a clone
I'll stick with my Samsung Galaxy S7....
The only thing I like iphone is this color so beautifull.
Can you buy me one i am  poor
You should give me a iPhone 7 my family doesn't have the money to get one if you want to you can contact me at 513-391-0183
Y does it look like a fake iPhone 7
Your video was awesome.everything was clearly explained. You're great
So what’s the difference?
Looks exactly like all the other iPhones lol...🤣
Space gray is my favorite
Is there going to be an update to fix the blur for pics and on Snapchat? Not sure if it’s the oled
Who’s watching on an iPhone 5s
These people have a lot of money and they buy buy iPhone by iPhone wasting money and I don't have an iPhone 3 😶
Is it weird that the new gold reminds me of the Pokemon, Chespin?
Is it like rose gold, I don’t want black or white, any suggestions?
Should I get the 8+ or the X it's my very first iPhone
I still have iPhone 5s..do you think I should upgrade to iPhone 8plus
The only apple product i like is an apple juice 😂😂😂😂😂iphone sucks as usual. Love android love root.
You have to take the picture First
Why didn't they make it gold all over including the front?
Is there a difference because I’m not fucking WASTING MONEY ANYMORE
ANY SMALL YOUTUBERS WANNA SUPPORT EACH OTHER 🤔 ????\n👈🏽👈🏽 NEW VIDEO OUT NOW!
Is it worth upgrading \n from an iPhone SE?
Få en ny iPhone 8 https://goo.gl/PyUQ1U

What is different between the 8+ and 7+ besides that wireless charging thing and glass look stuff
it's an ugly color lmfao i don't want a tan iphone wtf i deff don't see no gold in it besides the sides
It look that color because of the reflect of glass
I phone 6 squad where you at!

Mind blowing song.. Makes me feel like getting up and dance m heart out:-)

I love the video however isn't the lyrics a bit too much for a casual street performance with teens singing along?
That FAT ASS in thumbnail 😍😍.

My New song for bad aaaaa
M A R A V I L H O S A !
I love her vibe for the new album
If I spent a week without you\nBet you'd wonder what I do\nI think that I'd start going out\nGet caught kissing other dudes\n\nAnd it seems you just wanna bring me down, down\nWith your bad attitude (bad attitude)\nWhen you know I'm not one to keep dealing with the shit\nThat you put me through\n\nI know that I gave you my heart\nBut you stomped it to the ground\nAnd that's what got me wondering what it's like\nTo not have you around\n\nIf I spent a week without you\nHmm, I'd probably have so much fun\nFirst thing first I'd gather up all my girls, yeah\nSo we can lay out in the sun\n\nIt would be so nice not to worry, yeah\nHow I love not to stress\nI'd go and grab my old blue jeans\nI'm sick of wearing this silly dress\n\nI know that I gave you my heart\nBut you stomped it to the ground\nAnd that's what got me wondering what it's like\nTo not have you around\n\nYou know I'd miss you, baby\nFeels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old\nYou used to make me smile but now you don't do that anymore\nIt feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone\nBut when I think of you gone, I know\n\nI know that I gave you my heart\nBut you stomped it to the ground\nI don't want to wonder what it's like\nTo not have you around\n\nTo not have you around\nTo not have you around\nTo not have you around\nTo not have you around\n\nYou know I'd miss you, baby\nYou know I’d miss you, baby\nYou know I'd miss you, baby\n(Know I'd miss

Like giving you up that was beautiful this little pop same monotone is washed out deluded  she needs to demand more from her team!!
2 Cyrus song in one day🙌🙌🙌
This is stunning. This new album is 3 from 3, might even be my fave so far!
I feel all her albums are beautiful body of work and art
I love how she doesn't care about what people think. And her new music isnt the typical hits you get from pop artists and she doesn't care she does what she wants
This is going to be Miley's best album ever.
OMG this song is perfect for me right now, lit i'm so surprise and i love it. Thanks Miley i love you sooo much. My Dream is that someday you and me could smoke a joint
this song make me wanna spend weekend with my my self

she doesn't get tired of changing her clothes in each scenes...dat's mah girl.
You have really nice teeth
You should make.videos.more often anna,I love your videos ! \nIt's always perfect timing with the things I'm struggling with.
Wrote it on my list to talk to my therapist about , thabks
Was that a game of thrones reference tho lol
How do you always know when to post the right videos at the right time to make me feel better? Love you :)
I was procrastinating doing my homework by watching this video☺️
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS! Hi from DR.
Love you much cuz I do so many of those things that you talk about in your videos.
I initially subscribed to your page because I thought you are unusually attractive. But now I realize you're incredibly inspirational and a wonderful human being. Thank you!
the story of my life
I love you anna.
I don't need no help. I can sabotage me by myself.
I needed this today. Thank you 💕
I wonder what I would do to procrastinate and not get work done If I didn't Have internet or at least a screen to look at
I am a Mental Health Therapist and I want to thank you for being transparent and brave! You’re amazing!
HEY YOUR DAD WAS MY SUBSTITUTE  TEACHER TODAY WHICH IS PRETTY COOL. HE SAID HE HAS BEEN IN SCHOOLING FOR 27 YEARS AND IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON HIS PHD. I'M WONDERING WHAT HE IS DOING AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS VERY INSPIRING.
I swear your videos come out right when I need them 😥 thank you kind Ms.
Made big bridge and power plant. Now bridge blown away and power plant explosion. Self destroy very bad, destroy others. They no need bridge. Violence so good make powerful man. Hamburgers has never understood but lounges will.
You have the potential to be a great therapist yourself.  You think deeply about what is going on in your life and find ways to live more skillfully.  You are also an excellent communicator.  If an acting career should lose its luster, you could do a lot to help others (which you are already doing to some extent with these videos).
I wish I had enough money for therapy.
I'm procrastinating right now🙈🙊
I love this post... because it is so true and I'm sorry you lost your sister
Thanks, Anna. Great message. Thanks for continuing to both share, think, and make us think.
WHERE'S THAT SHIRT FROM!? *___* <3
I did it becuz of painful attachment trauma with my parents. But, now i know that im fine being on my own.
I love everything about this wonderfully-produced series. Well, not everything. You could use a lav mic or a boom mic. But other than my nit-picky bullshit, it's brilliant and engaging.
Woah\nThis make realize so many things.
i love you.
stay awesome gotham
I was so sad to hear about and later read about your sister.  I find it admirable that you have gone on to better your life and help others who may find themselves lost.  Please keep up the great videos - you have a wonderful mind!
legit, you are resonating with me in a scary way. i feel like i know you... i feel like im just going to become another fan boy... but you deserve the attention! you are hilarious and open and i hope i could meet a girl half as cool as you
Couldn't have said it better! Great job
I so needed this
This helps a lot thank you Ana!!! ❤❤❤
I love youuuu! I needed this today☺☺☺
I am so thankful for you ❤ I love your videos, some are really soul healing
Thank you so much
Where did you get that fox tee shirt!!? I love it!
Girl you got it all. Looks, Smarts and Talent!
Anna Akana: \n*Rock Show*\nLoudness/Crazy Nights\n(HighImpactFlix) \n<Pinned> Comment Section \nThe Vapors/I Think I'm Turning Japanese ;)\n\nBeastie Boys/Sabatage
yes how beautiful, to see how much youve grown and are able to help others through it.. thanks <3
I see you're stuffing your bras now or wearing a really strong push-up bra lol\nLooks nice tho 😂
I just did it. While pushing the person behind the doors.
With psychiatry, we call that cognitive behavioral theraphy where in we challenge and direct those kind of negative beliefs
Thank you so much for your videos. They are very well done & address issues I think everyone could stand to talk about a bit more in life. I admire the style of your channel, that its a self help style that includes a creative side. Your videos have made a difference in my life & I can't wait to see what else you create!! 💃✨
This happens to people without discipline.
Thx Anna. Your words encourage me to get up again.
I has no ideas who dis iz.  Shouldn't be showing ur face.  I already died few times.  It's not a big deal.  My shrinks and therapists need therapy after I was done with them.  Just call me Root.
My emotion high jacks my brain and the after math is horrible... then the shame kicks in instead guilt! Guilt makes me want to change but shame makes puts me in my place (I dont deserve love!!
Love how short and meaningful your videos are ♥️
Thanks akana , helped a lot
You ROCK!
Why are you so negative??
I tend to starve myself because I'm soo busy or tend to eat way to much. I think balance is hella important
I'm procrastinating right now..
Anna, you are so amazing!!Always a pleasure to watch your videos😊💓
thank you so much
You are definitely a strong role model for young ladies.
Thank you for all your hardwork and sharing your experiences. 💙
I love a lot of youtubers, but I know your videos are the ones that let me do this. I would be too depressed, or  scared of it, if you wouldn't tell me how to  beat these bad feelings.
I don't like most of your videos..but I lile ur videos about mental health..its something ppl don't talk about..its really nice to see someone speak up...
Dear Faiza,y you are obviously smart. There are many different types intelligence. Dance is an art and great exercise. Doing that most probably will spur you on to do well in your education, personal life because it's healthy. Please give yourself permission to do this sweetheart. You and the world will be a better place because of it. Now I am going to go tackle that editing on the book I've written. It may never see a single sale, but it's something I always wanted to do, to write. So you do your thing too. At 63 it is doubtful I'll be a choreographer, my other earliest dream. But I just might submit this book. I just might dance for this, all by my own thought up steps. God loved happy, I'm convinced of this!
Love you Anna
I'm happy to know that I'm not the only person that sometimes hisses like a cat.
You know when her Squarespace advertisements are so good that you're tempted to make a website even though you have no reason to have one?
Thank you for this.
I really needed this. I have been following you for about a year and this week lost a best friend to suicide I didn’t even think to watch your videos because I have been so down. When I saw your update I still didn’t think of it but as soon as your pretty face started talking and connecting with me my heart felt lighter and I heard some messages I really needed. Thank you for all you do!
Your sponsored videos are always so fun to watch. I'd usually skip them but not yours. Good job Anna! :)
I am a queen of self sabotage tbh but I'm seeing a therapist and working towards fixing that, as well as the multitude of other issues of course. It's a bit overwhelming but with time I think I'll be able to get there. I got really lucky that the first psychologist I've seen seems to be a perfect fit for me, she's great at identifying the negative things I do and getting down to why I do them.
I can relate so much hahaha I bought your book this week and I've almost finished it it's so good💓💓
I think it takes a lot of will to actually have conversations like that with yourself. You seem like a great, down to earth person that wants to know about her strengths and her weaknesses. Knowing that stuff might not always make you happy in the short term, but in the long term it will do wonders. I hope I get lucky enough to have awesome people like you in my life one day and anyone who has you in theirs is one lucky SoB. Keep being awesome!
Thank you! ☆
Wow. I need therapy
+Anna Akana\nI don't know who edits your videos but man. Props to that guy/women\n\nEditing style is insane. I hope you pay your editors enough. They deserve it
procrastination. procrastination. procrastination. Whhhhhhhhhhhy! Anna, how do you stop?
woah your toes have a strange alignment!
Anna you are amazing!
thank you....
Yupppppp
Thank you
1:06 cute toes

Thx 🙃

I feel attacked haha
You are so inspiring.

Perfect video for a perfect song.
I love the red room vibe, well shot and put together!
Never ending love for The Maine. So proud to be a fan of some of the most talented people out there💜
my kind of music video, simple but beautiful with a meaningful song, love it
I make watching this video part of my daily routine.
This is my favorite song off the album and this video is perfect 🖤
Vocês nunca cansam de me surpreender! Vocês são fodas desde sempre!!!! 💗💗💗
Favorite song off the album!! This was amazing I love you guys! Can't wait to see you live!! 🤣🤣
Freshly washed hair, Christmas vibes and my grandma's couch. Pretty much everything to make a pretty damn good music video ! See you on October 24th aaaaaand maybe November 24th ;)
I'm at least 40,000 of the views rn
Never heard of them, but this is good
I literally love them and everything about this video. My goodness.
☺️💕
i would love to see you guys in ATL this fall but I'm a poor college student lmao help me out pleeeeaaasseeee
I could use 2 tickets to your ny Huntington show because im a broke college student who just wants to see you guys in concert because i have been listening to american candy and lovely little lonely on repeat everyday
Love this song. Love this album. Love this video! And love you guys! So awesome to see how you've grown as a band. Still my favorite after 8 years! Thank you for being you!
Just got added to my channel  : )
Saw them live last week and John (main singer) and the bass player are the only ones who put any emotion into it
How can you not love this band? Beautiful music. Creative visuals. Adorkable guys. ❤
I feel wonderful. Emotional. You guys have making the music to my life the last 10-12 years. Thank you.
AHHH I love this album!! This is one of my fav songs on the album, so glad theres a video for it now and I like how this video brings a nice aesthetic to the song.
I love the simple aesthetic and all the close ups. Kind of reminds me of the Am I  Pretty video.
This is my feel good song. This song is so beautiful and it just hits home. I swear I've been different since the day I heard it. I've been listening to you guys forever but this song, it just linked up with my soul.
i think i’m in love with this band
(one of) my favorites songs + favorite flower = beautiful video \nCan't wait to see you guys in Sacramento!
this album is a milestone. love it so much,makes me feel so many different emotions,it had such an impact on me
Met these lovely guys on April 10, the week after LLL was reased at a pop up show in downtown LA. They were the loveliest and nicest people I've ever met. This album is so good and Taxi is one of my favorite songs off it. They are always so creative with their music videos, i love it. Hopefully i get to see them perform live for the first time during the Modern Nostalgia tour and talk to them again!💜
Every single one of your songs strikes a new chord. They are so raw and real- I'm a huge fan and I can't wait to see y'all again ❤️
Hi yes I saw y’all at warped tour in 2016 in NC and you changed my life that day. The energy y’all had was amazing and it’s one of the best live shows I’ve ever seen.  I love you guys so much and would love to see you again ❤️❤️❤️
this music video is so aesthetically pleasing to watch😍
Y'all are seriously my favorite band :) I have seen y'all twice and I cannot wait to see y'all for a third time! I adore yalls sound and unique sound! Please share the tickets with me so I can have my friends experience yalls awesomeness just like I have 😊❤️
being the procrastinator that i am, i've waited until now to watch this video. i think you guys are the only band that i truly love anymore. you're great and i love you
The aesthetic of this video is so cool! Another awesome music video by The Maine, also love this song so much! Great job guys!!!!
Congrats, guys! This music video is so amazing and my favorite so far!
I love the old-school film style of the video! How Do You Feel? is my favorite song--not only of LLL--but altogether of yours and I think the red theme in the background and on all of the instruments was the perfect way to symbolize the message of the song; there's blood running through your veins and how do you feel? Do you feel passion for life, what shakes your world and breaks your heart? It's a great reminder to really live life instead of just be alive. Thanks for the inspiration and the great video! I would DIE to see you all perform LLL & AC in full in Baltimore! ❤️❤️❤️
You guys have come suchhhh a long way it's so amazing how many peoples souls you've touched with your music
the maine and aesthetics, the recipe to perfection
I love this video and it’s vibe! These boys never disappoint. Thanks for keeping it fresh!
I got a Wendy's commercial before watching this video and now I'm craving fries. Anyways this song makes me feel something. Wish I could see you all on tour.
My fav on the album! So happy they made a video for it!
This song always makes me cry 'cause it hits home so much. Very, very lovely video you guys!
I've watched this way too many times... yet here I am again. 😍😂
me ? crying at how much i love these boys ? you betcha
This is my favorite song off the new album and I'm sooo excited to hear it on the Modern Nostalgia tour! also I'm intrigued by the girl in the video for .2 secs. What happens to her?!?
I’m shaking in my boots
Why dosent this have alot of views?!?
The Maine just has that ability to create and perform songs that you want to be enveloped in <3
SUCH A GREAT ALBUM! I can't even!! This is too good😭😭💜
Such a good song
no offence but john o'callaghan has the prettiest eyes
Manila's waiting for the modern nostalgia tour!!
How do you feel?
this is beautiful BUT COULD YOU PLEASE ADD A SF DATE
ARE YOU ALIVE BUT ARE YOU LIVING?! MY FAVE LINE YOU GUYS NEVER FAIL! White suit yas please <3
Always killing it with the aesthetics. So much love for this band and the whole 8123 family.
Great song. Love the aesthetics

I LOVE THIS I LOVE YOU
Love love love this song. Maybe my favorite from the album. Keep it up you guys 😁
I really love how there's always a concept behind every album period. Especially love this one 💕
You guys keep putting out the coolest videos! Super impressed and excited to have visuals to go along with the most incredible album. Aesthetic game so strong
Nice video 💛💛💛💛\nLoved Kennedy's guitar
THANK YOU SOO MUCH FOR MAKING A MUSIC VIDEO FOR THIS. THIS SONG MEANS A LOT TO ME❤️
I wonder how many roses you guys have been through during the LLL era so far 😂
WHAT A MUSIC VIDEO!!!!! Guys, please release a Behind The Scenes version.
this song is so good I cant
wow, I love this video so much!! Me and my friend olivia would love to see you guys in Cleveland!!! American candy and LLL are two of my all time favorite albums , I would love to share this experience with my best friend!
god this is the loveliest thing... I think if I HAD to pick a favorite song from LLL, it'd be tough but this one would probably be it. this song somehow is both the best song to jump around to dance to and my go-to I had a bad day I need to drive around late at night screaming the lyrics to a song that makes me feel better track. CAN'T WAIT FOR MODERN NOSTALGIA
It really warms my heart seeing how far y'all have come since I found you guys on Myspace back in 2008. Here's to many more years to come watching y'all do what you love because you love it! :)
You are the best guys❤️
This song definitely gets me in my feels 😭 the opening line gives me chills every time. “Dearly depressed and broken hearted” love you guys so much 💕
I'd sell my left leg to hear this live
Please please please give me tickets I want to see garretts hair in person
Love this. Love you punks. So so proud 💕
Gave me some That Thing You Do! vibes :) Great video for an exceptional song! Thanks for continuing to spoil us with such great content!
This video is beautiful. The Maine always kills aesthetic. Me and my best friend would love 2 tickets to the Buffalo  NY date. This band has deeply impacted both of us and brought us closer as friends. We are so thankful for this band and we were lucky enough to see you earlier this year. Thank you for creating music and impacting so many lives
John bebezinho, o amor que eu tenho por esse álbum é imenso <3333333333333
If I win the tickets I'm taking my friend Ana she likes you guys
It sucks how little recognition deserving bands like these get. And shit songs like despacito, etc gets so much attention. These songs help people through shit and make them feel happy. World's a fucked up place.#IamTheMaine

Producer in public square on megaphone: Hey! Has anyone here ever ridden a bicycle before?\nRandy: I sat on my friend's bike once.\nProducer: You're hired!
I honestly can't tell if this is a joke or not
I love how spends all his time looking at the places he CAN'T go with this contraption
What the hell did I just watch
This is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why do we only see him riding for about 5 seconds at a time? Why is he wobbling endlessly in each of those 5 second clips? Why is he so slow? Why is the bike so damn heavy? And probably most importantly..... Just, why?!
Three words kill with fire
this is without doubt the most cringeworthy, badly thought out product i have ever seen, with a video that is quite possibly worse...i hate sounding like a troll, but im just being honest.  it does look pretty cool but
2 wardrobe changes and a near wreck in a promo vid...wow
This is fucking cringe worthy. Fire your marketing manager immediately.
I am going to be seriously surprised if even one of these bikes sell.
EVERYONE, I give you future of cycling..........
wow he sure is having trouble with those fields
Dude takes a lot of breaks for being on an ebike.
What in the fuck was that? Is this a joke?
Have you tards ever seen a real bike? This turd looks like it was based off a kids drawing. Fail.
good thing this contraption is not available for purchase... because the only thing worse than the bike was how it handled in that edit! oh, what was that actually edited, or did I just watch the outtakes
This give two options, the bike rides really bad and make it feel unsafe or the rider have had never touched a bike, either way make me want to steer even more away from it
Kill it with fire
He doesn't even look that tall, and the bike is super-short and awkward to pedal even for the test rider. Maybe they should take a cue from every bicycle made in the past one hundred years and integrate some method to adjust the seat height.
Damn! Dude at least pretend you're having fun! \n\nThat type of vids are not getting any sales for sure!
This guy rips it up! Radical dude.
Amazing video, shared: https://www.imbikemag.com/mountain-bike-news/2017/09/carbon-suv-e-bike-leave-the-road/
wtf is this hahahahaha ... just dump
great if you are 5 feet tall
Trash.
Worst video EVER......Defineatey NOT Hip Hip
good job bro all the haters are just coming from pinkbike dont mind them, they are mountain bike gear junkies so they get offended when they see this type of content
This video is a piece of shit along with the bike.
I liked his hair.
u are already a fashion icon! #traceeellisross
This has got to be my favorite 73 questions, love Trace 😊she seems so warm 💕
Finally, Vogue has done something truly amazing. Tracee is and has been such a wonderful, joyful spirit! Her smile is so contagious!
It's funny because she had all these little phrases she would start sentences with that made it seem more impromptu but the fact that she had little containers of all the salts she has above her sink shows that I was so staged. I think Tracy is great.
What superpower would you like to have The power to impeach.... LOL!
She's so sexy 😩
I just love her, I just want her to know that she has a fan in Mexico City ;) jajajajaja

The drop sucks... again
A very pragmatic vision by Edward Heath one sorely missed at the present time in Britain. More importantly demonstrates great knowledge/leadership on this important subject matter away from narrow ideologies.
really weird comments here...
This self serving tosser sold us out to Brussels and then admitted it on television 20 years later. I wonder what hidden recompense he received?
Fucker should have sunk on his yacht!, dig the fucking traitor up and sling whats left of him in the ocean.
UK/Europe: 1972-2016
To boot,he gets a 40k prize to betray his country. Politicians sticking it the people.sound familiar?History repeats it self over and over and over. And the sleeping masses can't be bothered to spit, less alone pass the lube as we get royally.... if you don't know what word was to follow royally you won't understand my sentiment.2017 and we are at the cuspHopefully enough are awake to make a difference.
I guess we will go back to no mans land again. No Empire, no Europe.
A man who could destroy his own nation state by sucking it into the European Union and lying about that intention on television to his own people, is capable of raping and murdering children.
Just another puppet of the hidden hand!
disappointing with the lack of singing
dirty child molester pedophile rot in hell!!!
Please sigh below petition. He was a traitor.\n\npetition.parliament.uk/petitions/122770

Worst act of betrayal and deceit of the British people that there has ever been.  I really hope Brexit really does mean Brexit and that T.May sees it through.

Is there a reason why our fingers in our hands have different length
As someone who works in blood banking thank you for mentioning it! A lot of people don't realize it can affect their ability to donate.
People would eat the ground-up meat and bones of those who question the government.
0:28 Worst words to hear after having sex.
This guy overuses his hands something fierce
this reminds me of something that happens in in some tribes in Africa called the laughing disease if you know what i am talking about then you understand why
What Happened to Mad Cow Disease? They renamed it PMS. \nI sincerely apologize for the above. But I just could not resist, I'm a bad, bad man.
The reason I can’t give blood in Canada
2:30 ... at least these wereren’t ground up and fed to other humans.
True, the Gekke Koeien Ziekte as it was known locally kept people in a panic for years and thankfully it seems under control. For now. What's missing in this vid though is the less pleasant details that really will impact us in the next few decades and centuries. \n\nNamely that as a preventative measure millions of cows were slaughtered, some for being merely within 5km of a mad cow diseased bovine. As a result of which, cattle stock is getting a bit more incestuous than is healthy. Not just for extra limbs and such, but more because the next disease could be the one to wipe them all out due to shared weaknesses. \n\nAdditionally, the loss of so many cattle caused the usual human drama: bankruptcy, homelessness, pointless marching in protest, etc.. But that's less significant.
Dawn thus correspondent task desire short must carry chef.
So mad cow disease is Kuru for cows?
Mad Cow was so over hyped by the Vegans and Tree Huggers. There is no proof that any human was infected with BSE by eating beef. But then again, eating cow brains is a delicacy in some parts of Europe.\nCJD doesn't appear to be the result of zoonosis.\n3:41 It is unlikely that CJD is spread by blood transfusions.
dont eat cow in uk\nill remember that
I think it's safe to say that most animals can't handle any form of cannibalism. When humans eat humans specifically human brains the person dining will most likely develop a lovely disease known as Kuru a.k.a laughing sickness. This is also a prion disease that eats away at the brain causing it to look spongey. Basically it's mad cow disease for humans. Not saying all animals can't eat their own kind but there's a reason why we shouldn't feed ourselves and animals ground up remains of their species. I'm sure somewhere out there is a mad scientist experimenting on this occurrence to understand why cannibalism causes such strange ailments or what causes a perfectly healthy prion to become a traitor.
Scrapie was likely to have been caused by the inbreeding of sheep for desirable characteristic
and what about the reference to rapeseed content of the feed causing Mad Cow Disease? I understand that when it was removed from the feed the disease mysteriously disappeared. Also in order to use it for human consumption, they (canola industry) knew they had to reduce the poisonous content to make it nearly safe for human consumption....
know why it's called PMS ?\n\n\n\nbecause ...... 'Mad Cow Disease is ALREADY TAKEN !!!
Cow 1 to cow 2: Are you worried about mad cow disease? Cow 2: Why would I be? I'm a chicken!
I once knew a contortionist named Prion she drove all the men insane
I’ve never been able to donate blood because of my time living in Europe during the height of Mad Cow Disease.
Deadly Feasts By Richard Rhodes is a really interesting book about mad cow and related diseases in both humans and other animals. It follows the researchers who discovered it and the prions that cause it. Or look up the documentary Kuru: The Science and the Sorcery here on YouTube to learn about and see one of those researchers and the vCJD he studied.
Why were we feeding ground up sick animals to cows? Don't cows eat grass?
YOUTUBE FOR FUCKSAKE STOP RECOMMENDING ME THIS VIDEO, I ALREADY WATCHED IT TWICE
A family friend just died a month ago of vCJD. I wonder when they made this video. Was he included in the four cases from the U.S., or has the number now jumped to five? :(
And now we're feeding chicken by products to chickens..........
I knew JCVD was deadly but damn.
they also make pigs carnival.
I still don't like hamburgers though. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I just hate the taste. :|
if you want to know more about this, look up kuru
Use lake conclusion chief half site display healthy.
So thats what all the fuss was about... huh.
Fun fact! This is why I don't eat beef! But now also environmentalism reasons.
Considering hamburgers are 90% lips and arseholes.....its probably best to sear clear of them anyway.
I can't donate blood since I used to live in Europe in the 90's because of this. It's like I have Schroedinger's Mad Cow Disease.
YEAHhhhhhhh .... Just totally gloss over the fact that the cattle testing program here in the US wouldn't catch a case that occurred even if there was one. Besides not testing nearly enough of the cattle we eat, the cattle are slaughtered at less than 2 years old. Which is long before BSE would be detectable. And even one prion is enough to eventually kill you, the amount you eat just determines how long the incubation period is. And we have an Alzheimer's epidemic where the symptoms can in some cases be strikingly similar to vCJD... (cough cough ignore the anomalous autopsies of Alzheimer's and dementia patients.)
It's been mooted that a cleaning process involving carbon-tetraflouride that was stopped, IIRC, in the 80's, (over legitimate concerns about it's use) may have allowed the scrapie prion to migrate.
I wonder if Donald Trump ate his own steaks? If so, where did they come from? \nThat might explain a lot! ;-)
Prions in land fills, do not die. Think about what they do with the brain. The brain contains the Prions and yes they can travel to other areas of the body, but mostly they are found in the brain.
They run out of finance after the project got discovered, like the aids and anti biotics project. All man made problems they get paid to fix.
I actually know someone who died of mad cow disease about 5 years ago and in just two months she was dead. it was on the news and everyone was freaking out cause apparently another lady in the same area got it around the same time
I was in the UK during the mid 90's and for that reason i'm not allowed to donate blood.
Is a similar disease that infects whitetail deer and caused by a similar issue it can leave entire regions uninhabitable for whitetail deer for Generations
A friend of mine still doesn't eat beef because of it.
3:33 the bit about donating blood. It seems every blood drive I run into, I seem to be the first one to have ever educated any of the people taking blood on this. When I tell them I cannot donate blood because I lived in Germany between 1978 and 1982, and again between 1988 and 1994, they just look at me like I'm weird.
So if it isn't a problem to eat meat from a cow with mad cow disease, how come they won't allow you to donate blood if you lived in England during the outbreak?
Done it again, though this was going to be about 3 phase feminism.\n🤣😂😂🤣 no this is about friendly animals.
Mad cow disease is on the streets and called Antifa.
.......how did they not figure out an herbivore shouldnt be fed an cannibal diet....... oh Europeans. your history is quite telling
i remember an outbreak of it in the 2000s and i remember alot of hispanics were pissed about about it because alot of cow organs werent sold because of the disease scare. you had a higher risk of getting it if you ate the organs.
What happened to Mad Cow Disease?\nGovernment Regulation & Enforcement.
what makes it really scary is that prions can remain inactive in the brain for decades before being set off. there are people who ate infected beef in the 90s are still alive today with ticking time bombs in their heads.
My mother has this sad to say
There's one inaccuracy in this video. When he says that all cases in the u.s. were picked up over seas. My grandma died of vCJD before i was born. They don't know how she got it. So we can't know for sure that it was picked up over seas
New farming practices yeah like not force cannibal feeding cows? Genius.
I actually knew one of the few that were effected by the human strain. It was really sad :(
In India, we call people like you 'Champu'😂
huh.. so its not a zombie apocalypse.
Yep, can't donate blood in the USA because of living in the UK in the early 90s.
Why do people scream during night? How to fix it?
Maybe we could look at the theory of Kuru
perhaps, the cows are no longer angry. arbitration, i suppose ...et carter
Your steak is not out to get you\nthat's debatable, lol
1.Get a grass eater.\n2.Feed it its own meat.\n3.Wait for results.\n4.Repeat the process.\n5.Call yourself a wise ape.\n6.NO PROFIT.
What the he’ll is this. Everybody knows made snail disease is worse
Human madness also comes from eaten crushed human bones and muscles
The government creates these diseases to scaremonger , what ever happened to mad cow disease , bse, bird flu , SARS , Ebola ,
If a cat is pissed off at me does it have mad meow disease?
Now I'll go and eat steak.
Weird, I looked it up awhile back & found something about it being caused by the pesticides being used on the cows to keep flies that make holes in their hides away, and the chemicals from said pesticides reached their brains because of the holes flies had made. Good to know the actual cause though.
But how is the cow mad..
Well, that's comforting to know.......?
So we don't know for sure how people got vCJD but we know all Americans who got it picked it up overseas. You guys...
I always read that eating the raw brain of your species is what causes the prions to become mad and react with a degenerative disease. \nBasically you can't eat someone else's prion. It doesn't like yours and will attack.
There is a similar prion disease in humans called Kuru. Groups in Papua New Guinea that practiced cannibalism in funeral ceremonies cooked and ate most of the body including the brain. After the practice was discontinued new cases dropped dramatically but it still popped up for over 50 years from people who were infected before the practice was ended. The last official death from Kuru was in 2009 and the epidemic was declared over in 2012 with no verifiable cases since.
Man I guess I should never eat cow anymore. Probably shouldn't eat pork just to be safe. Plus with bird flu I shouldn't eat chicken either. You know what? I'm just going to eat bats and bush animals, that's almost certainly safer!
I'm a Vegan now 😊
The previous episode on the same topic was way more informative - \nthis is all about cannibalism \nhttps://youtu.be/Cubu-k7kSvw
The human appetite for animal flesh is a driving force behind virtually every major category of environmental damage now threatening the human future - deforestation, erosion, fresh water scarcity, air and water pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, social injustice, the destabilization of communities and the spread of disease. -- The World Watch Institute

Prions suck.
Love Stefan ❤️
what about mad snail disease?
Oh, not the moomoos!
Cows were fed with dead Cows?? ? Srsly. Aren't cows herbivores?
Kuru.
JCVD
....but...where is Hank?....
Why hollywood wont hire mad cow disease anymore.
Red sky at night,\nCattle alight.
Also THE FACT THAT COWS WERE BEING FED TO OTHER COWS WTF 😱
You know the best way to avoid getting mad cow disease, don't eat meat, simple.
what happened to ebola, Sars, west nile and Zika?
Another good reason to be vegan
New farming practices like....not telling the truth about how farmers and the American government work together to cover up the cases? Then any case exposed is tarred as Alzheimer's or dementia instead? 🤔
Is this how dementia is being  branded as a modified version of cjd but the govt not admit it ?
Anyone remember John Selwyn Gummer making his daughter eat burgers on British news? Or the pubs defiantly selling 'Mad Cow baps'? Or how about all this combined with Edwina Curry's Salmonella scare convincing the world there was no edible food in the U.K?
How did people get vCJD if it's not transmitted through meat?
In brazil too. I couldn't donate because I lived in europe for 6 years, being the limit 5.
New album in the works? 🙌💯☹️
Rip
Fuck i remember bumping to this in 2002.... so much nostalgia
this is my christmas song shoutout to all those girls I have loved
can i ask? is he talking about his lifestyle in the past? when he was at his peak and on the throne or is he talking about the present? Has he turned to drugs to now?
cry all over that freakin like button boys
Bored? Listen to the song on my channel 👍🎶
The only thing that I have a problem with is that there is a little bit to much autotune in it
This song is great Yung Leandoer, but you really need to make a video of you digging a hole properly
This sounds like a song made for toddlers to memorize something
lyrics:\nWe were on the throne, living on our own\nHunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)\nShe just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands\nMake a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect\n\n[Verse 1]\nWrist, diamonds, ice, neon green lights\nDon't care about the price, I cop it, I smash it, this size\nWrist, diamonds, ice, percocet, my Sprite\nPercys in my Sprite, Louis bag, three stripes\n\nAs I walk through the fire with my wings\nI could only stop for this iron like a lane\nShe just want to pop all the molly in the Benz\nI've been getting rich, making money with my friends\nBitch, we off them shits, time to stay until the end\nI'm just trynna pop all the bottles, fuck the feds\nI got 50 pills all up in our money bags\nShe gon' watch how I spend it, like, just to get it back\nSitting on the field, snakes through the money tracks\nBreaking in and entering, bitch we popping tags\nKeep the fire burning off a blunt like candle wax\nBurning down your money 'til it ain't nothing to stacks\n\n[Hook]\nWe were on the throne, living on our own\nHunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)\nShe just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands\nMake a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect\n \n\n[Verse 2]\nFlick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite\nLiving my life, I'm alright, shawty, she my type\nDie for this I might, chains all freeze outside\nFlick all my lights, chain, dirty Sprite\n\nAs I hop by the avenue with my wings\nBaby don't stop, wanna give you everything\nWhen we off them rocks, I'mma tell you everything\nSoap on my shoes and on my heart, it's getting thin\nBut you're a butterfly riding through the desert winds\nI'm a really bad, I love all the finer things\nWhen I come close, close to you I can't sin\nHeaven knows I'm bad, but Lord, I can't fix a thing\nFly too close to the sun, my wings give in\nI gave you my whole life, don't owe you a thing\nAs I chose life and this rug made of mink\nBurning down the Winter 'cause I'm over everything\n\n[Hook]\nWe were on the throne, living on our own (Leandoer stranger)\nHunting my own skin, want it to break in (break it in)\nShe just wanna dance, I'mma get them bands\nMake a lot of stacks, bitch, I'd die for my respect
i can barely understand the hook but leandoer still made it go hard

I hate to generalize, but it seems like in our society, the more appropriate response to bad things happening is anger. To many, it seems, anger denotes strength, the sense that I won't let people walk all over me. If we respond with sadness or melancholy, which is healthier I think, people tend to look down on us, label us as a Debbie Downer or a Sad Sack. They would rather we pretended to be happy so as not to upset THEIR comfortable existences. But I think we yearn for that kind of honesty about our feelings, and I think there's a strength and wisdom toward resisting the urge to get angry. Not that anger is always bad. It just seems we tend to see it as valuable, whereas sadness is something to cover up or cure. Am I way off base?
hA well I'm invulnerable how about that
1.   The only way we can truly connect with someone is by taking risks . If a friend tells me that he has trouble sleeping, I can tell him that for the longest time I was having nightmares almost every night , it got a bit better, but that's how I know what insomnia means. Well, then he may think that I must be a real weirdo.  But he may also take it as an invitation for us to engage in a real conversation where we could go deeper into the subject. \n\nDeeper often means darker and more complex. But still, because you two make the effort to get there together, in that moment you are really LIVING through something. That's what feeling connected means. \n\nNo matter how sad the subject is, you will come out of such a conversation with a sense of serenity and it  will be a  good memory because you have truly shared something. \n\nI love this quote by Theodore Zeldin: \n\n The kind of conversation I am interested in is one which you start with a willingness to emerge a slightly different person. It is always an experiment, whose results are never guaranteed. It involves risk. It 's an adventure in which we agree to cook the world together and make it taste less bitter. \n\n\n2. We usually try to impress the other, in the hope of being loved . But indeed boasting about yourself is not being impressive, it is being intimidating. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Something that came to you very easily in life can be incredibly difficult to reach for another person. So by pointing THAT out, you are emphasising what  separates you from that person. \nWhat is the sense of this??\n\n\n3. There is a wonderful, wonderful tale  by Oscar Wilde called  The Remarkable Rocket. You can read the tale or watch the animation . It is on you tube. Well, in fact, the most remarkable thing about that rocket is that the more it boasts, the more it sinks into the mud!\n\nComedian Sarah Jones uses a wonderful term, describing the darker side of the social media, forcing us to show a happy face all the time. She says it is a culture of  compare and despair. \n\nIf you want to think more about this,  there is an episode of the excellent podcast Hidden Brain, called  Schadenfacebook. \n\n4. This video does not suggest that we must always talk about our problems. Being a  me, me, me type of person is really something else. \n\n  It is another thing to dare to open up about the challenges you are facing right now, hoping that the other person could also learn something from what you are going through. Because indeed, anything can happen to any of us anytime. \n\nI guess it was Seneca who said that a ship may also sink at the port.. \n\n5. And don't miss the wonderful TED Talk   The Power of Vulnerability by Brene Brown. Her book on the subject,  Daring Greatly is also very helpful. \n \nThanks a lot for this very valuable lesson. I loved the animation too.
Theses animations are incredibly hilarious and great ^^   Great video
Like how you brought back the squishy noises

this animation is gross.  the sound effects and the colors all remind me of fat. the characters are barbarically fat.  this is just difficult to listen to because it makes we want to vomit.  that would be disclosing something of my hidden self. blech.
It's such an inspiring topic and a great speech
This reminds me a lot of what I've already read a few years ago in Daring Greatly by Brene Brown. I highly recommend the book, it's also about vulnerability.
Nah, you are just gay
animation reminds me of Harold and the Purple Crayon
how to handle our vulnerability not in an unfortunate way?
im awkward and lonely...who else is with me?
Why be normal? Being weird and different, unique and crazy, that's all so much more fun and interesting than being normal. And, what is normal anyway? Just a word used to say, most people act this way and it's weird if you don't. BE UNIQUE. BE DIFFERENT. BE YOU. Never change. And everybody is vulnerable, so why laugh at it, or make fun of it? Just pointless if you're making fun of somebody for it when you might feel the same way.
I don't like how the head emerged from the body.
What background music did you use on your Higher Conscious video?
I wonder what mr. De Botton is going through in his life right now
I thought the title meant a more physical evolutionary way
Since I graduated college, I've had a few sudden revelations. One I'm better at handling and actually making since of abstract ideas than when I started. Two the principle of wabi sabi is present in western folk cultures. Specifically if you listen to american labor union hymns. There's something so uplifting, and quasi-spiritual about that music (especially if you're a worker, like me). It's country, it could be said to have blues influences. That, and the international socialist anthem. But that last one is qualitatively different. How?
Psychological warfar e get over youself you meed a clue jack
Knowing how to share your vulnerability is a key aspect to confidence. Such as having one or two safe people to share your vulnerabilities with. But also doing it from the point of view of accepting that vulnerability as a stepping stone to growing as a stronger person.
I love the message, and I love the video 💗🔥😂so epic
this is why i haven't made a true friendship in ages nor will i easily find love lol.
The importance of vulnerability is so I can use it to crush you. ❤️
Take this advice into combat, into a marriage, into a room full of debaters, onto the basketball court, any sport, and of course the advice fails.
Just because you have a million times more subscribers than me does not mean I don't need people to watch my videos. \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
*Grow a pair...*\nWheter you're a man or a woman.*\n\n\n\n\n*Beginning now:\nYes, there are *only* two genders.\nYou're welcome.

He pooped out his head from his shoulders.
2:43 Me whenever I feel like fighting someone.
They used pink as a color of innocence, vulnerability, fragile etc. Love it
This is great!! Could you do one on intimacy? (closely linked to vulnerability)! Thanks!!
I usually wear my durag on FaceTime early in the getting to know you stage of dating so the woman feels comfortable enough to wear her bonnet/head scarf which opens her open up in all other aspects. Something very small but an example of how your vulnerability can makes others comfortable enough to be vulnerable as well. Lol
I loved what this video was about, but hated the graphics and crunchy noises.
I realised how important vulnerability was when I broke up with my first exboyfriend and my brother, who usually was my buddy for watching shows or listening to music, came into my room when I was crying my eyes out, barely being able to talk. He sat with me on my bed for two hours, hugging me and talking to me, and since that moment he tells me his problems and talks to me about what makes him sad, which he has literally *never* done since he was 15.\nI think he really just needed to realise that just like he can be there for others, others can be there for him.
This is such a beautiful message.
The animation is awesomely weird and the way this is worded is brilliant.
Can you guys do a vid on bad habits and why it's hard to break them.
The best nasty animation I have ever watch!
The video didnt speak on being vulnerable to yourself before others. Give yourself the chance to be vulnerable enough to admit  your shortcomings and flaws. It's far better than someone else showing you the true mirror, if not with the very intentions, leaving you exposed and coming face to face with your flaws for the first time. Especially if you are someone who likes building a wall around themselves.
This is my problem with friends and coworkers. I let go just enough without showing any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. It's a good way to get through the day and function like a normal looking human being, but I feel like I lack those really deep relationships with others.
I think people need to stop being self conscious, narcissistic ass hats.
Just want to say that I wish good luck to everyone who will this. Hope you achieve your goals. Hardwork pays off. \nMuch love, peace :)
This animation reminds me of when I used to watch Maisy.
sound effects were pretty distracting, but the message itself is pretty great
That's why memes are important. Share memes instead of anything personal on the Internet.
I'm not the most succinct person but my take on the message is vulnerability = humanness ---> oneness, the unmasking of our fronts or differences ---> true connection + less loneliness, thus sincere love and joy. \n\nMy algorithm on happiness. Easier said than done. \n\nIt's weird. I was just at the Vatican in Rome last week. (Nothing fancy, I was just on a short vacation on my own till I met up with a friend) I was waiting in line to pay for a ticket to go up the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. A young couple was pleading for an exchange of cash of US dollars to Euros. They had no cash to pay for the tickets. No one was helping them/ or I was the only American in line that would care for dollars (we will never know). I offered to help and they were very grateful. I thought nothing of it after continuing in the line to go up the steps. The young boy went to the head of the line (where I was) and thanked me again and again. He was so relieved. \n\nI still regret it. I wanted to be vulnerable and say We are the Vatican, whether you believe in this religion that created this beauty or not... why wouldn't I help... It's not only the religious thing to do, it's the human thing do. Instead I humbly and sheepishly said Oh, it's nothing. It's not a problem.  It's really wasn't a problem, but I still regret not saying what I really felt. I didn't want to feel vulnerable with my intrinsic values in the middle of a Roman tourist attraction. I guess my greater message was that love and compassion made me do it, not only a fear of God or those kind of negative religious associations. It's odd because I felt compelled to tell this to him. I really thought I was crazy. People don't talk like that I thought... I guess I was scared of his rejection of my personal values. I feared his projections of my honest intentions. Even if his gratitude turned to disgust due my reference to a religion, I should have been strong enough to take any reaction, because I was being open and aiming for genuine care for the other. \n\nI wasn't vulnerable, because I felt ashamed. Looking back, why feel\nashamed with being kind - no matter the source, rationality or irrationality of that action.\n\nIt was one of my favorite moments of the trip. I fell short with this, but I challenge myself to do better as a human being with a soul that is longing to express and connect meaningfully with others- whether at the front of a Walgreens or the front of a majestic Roman church.
I like your thumb people
Showing vulnerability can vary on how people react. Some people will find a way to belittle you and want to have the upperhand and will use this against you. Others will be more accepting of it and feel a connection with you because they too make mistakes. Show a bit of vulnerability and take a step back and see how the other person reacts..
Brenè Brown has a very good ted talk about this exact topic, I emplore anyone interested in this topic to check it out.
I'm a very different person from who I was five years ago. A better person. I was scared of vulnerability before. I felt as though I was placing my emotional stability and happiness in the hands of others by being vulnerable. These days, I've found that I feel more in control of my life and my emotions than I ever have, and I believe it's largely due to my willingness to be vulnerable; my ability to be honest with others, and honest with myself, about who I am and how I feel. I'm proud of that. (:
this is really Hard to watch
This is so beautiful
I don't mean to shit on your guy's videos but can you guys please tone down the horrible sound effects, please everything else; great video love your content :)
0:48 Ok what the fuck is happening
This hurts because it's true
This is a Perfect interpretation of vulnerability and the animation is so well made, Thanks for making such great videos <3
I used to live in China and I was not very good at speaking Chinese. Statistics would have you believe that a third of people spoke English, and at first I didn't believes that, because they wouldn't talk to you because they were afraid of making a mistake or not speaking English very well. However, I eventually discovered some ways to coax it out of them, one of which was to intentionally do something embarrassing. I also found a good way was to pay them a compliment, anything that brought yourself down a level, or caused them to feel brought up a level. it eventually became apparent that the statistic was close to accurate. I could also tell who was likely to speak English by looking at them, and judging by their age, and how they dress. I know that sounds superficial, but it had close to 100% reliability.
I'm no expert but I got to tell you those are some gross sound effects.
I think the producer may be projecting just a bit. Many good points, peppered with what seems situation specific occurrences (i.e. being mean to loved ones; That's a choice not a state of being.)\n     Take responsibility for yourself. Take control of your own life. Take back our homeworld.
Inner Idiot would be a great name for a band.

The sound effects...
Why do they sound squishy? Yuck
I pretend to be vulnerable so others open themselves up for manipulation.
guys be a pussy, its gonna help trust me, be a pussy ok, be weak
Why do much squish? Why so much squishing? If as a visual metaphor then cool, but omg, I want to vomit
The message is awesome but the creepy almost disturbing animation and disgusting squishy sound effects are sort of distracting.
Nah don't be vulnerable, I was vulnerable once with a girl that I loved more than anything in this world and she fucked me by cheating on me but I only found out when she left me. I swore I'd never give my heart to anyone every again, fuck bitches and leave them. Be strong, be hard, be a fucking bastard to chicks coz they'll fuck you in a heartbeat
Fuck vulnerability! Be the machine 100% of the time! Kill every weakness.
This channel is getting disconnected from reality more and more and is more about wishful thinking of how things should be.\n This video + the you are not what you earn one totally shows it. \n\nPeople accept weaknesses less and less and only value others as numerical values or thorugh their social status.\nI wish it was different but sadly it is not. \nPerhaps you should make a video about the dehumanization we undergo in the world right now.
What's the point if any emotion.... I hate emotions... But I suppose thats an emotion😂
these videos are so well written
This is one of the best and most important YouTube channels there are. Thanx ppl. You rock!!!
Those animations are really bad and hard to undestand.
the squishy sound detracts from the video message

What is with music artists showing Gay couples in every fricken music video?  Almost every artist has now done it.  WHY?  LGBT's are a perverted MINORITY, and we have been making them out to be the biggest subsection of all adults and I don't know why.  It's really sickening!

Too Good At Goodbyes\n\nYou must think that I'm stupid\nYou must think that I'm a fool\nYou must think that I'm new to this\nBut I have seen this all before\n\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the most to you\nIn case you go and leave me in the dirt\n\nEvery time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\n\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\nI know you're thinking I'm heartless\nI know you're thinking I'm cold\nI'm just protecting my innocence\nI'm just protecting my soul\n\nI'm never gonna let you close to me\nEven though you mean the most to me\n'Cause every time I open up, it hurts\nSo I'm never gonna get too close to you\nEven when I mean the most to you\nIn case you go and leave me in the dirt\n\nEvery time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\n\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nNo way that you'll see me cry\n(No way that you'll see me cry)\n\nI'm way too good at goodbyes\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nNo\nNo, no, no, no, no\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\nNo, no, no, no\nNo, no, no\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n(No way that you'll see me cry)\n(I'm way too good at goodbyes)\n\n'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry\nAnd every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry\nAnd every time you walk out, the less I love you\nBaby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true\nI'm way too good at goodbyes
@0:00 when your door needs some kind of oil to stop this sojnd
I absolutely love him
He is such a great singer , and Too Good At Goodbye is an amazing song.
Why does he looks so skinny and weird now? great song though
A few more times getting hurt and you're at the point where you going to sing about real life.
This song is apart of me , it gets me every time.
Baby we don't stand a chance..
Ummm hey I need a collaboration with Adele
this song reminds me of my dead grandma. im havin tears
Holy crap I was in tears
I was beginning to think that he was died lol because I haven't heard new music from him in a long time... but on another note, this song is so beautiful and I really love it
this is beautiful. sam smith is beautiful. legend is back!
looks like the nicer version of Mac Miller now
Yay he's back!! WE LOVE YOU SAM SMITH
he came back with such a good song <3
I waited 3 years to have a new album , The wait its over , btw Sam is awesome i always loved his voice
Is he Gay? Curious..
Does he have AIDS? He looks too thin.

OMG he's looking so sexy. Something has changed. Now his lips looks so kissable haha
So hard not to let the feels out...

I like both of the original version and this version <3 \nThe girl has a great voice, you know :D I'm so proud that I knew your channel, Kurt. <3
Alicia you voice so so beautiful!! I like it☺
not bad but you ruined the song in its feeling. However kudos to the efford, quality and voice. Still, doesnt mean you successfully deliver the song (before anyone trash talking to me, remember you can appreciate artists, love them but that dont mean you could be blind)
she looks like bella thorne before her meltdown
Wow 😌😭
Holllyyyy crepe! I followed my heart, thought it would lead to the kitchen, but here I am. My spatula nearly flipped when it saw this video! XDXD

Once again, Theres Kurt playing 2 pianos (keyboard too) And yet here I am I can't get one key to sound like harmony...
Please Do an Avicii or a Calvin Harris mashup next!!!
I usually don't like this song, but YOU MADE ME LOVE IT.
Fire happening in the KITCHEN. Love everything you all are doing <3
You should do Beautiful Thing by Grace Vanderwaal ❤️ :)
music is too loud where we cant hear the voice al the time....
Never heard this song before.. But great job on the song and video.. That drummer tho.. :) so much passion in his playing!! :) <3 Would LOVE to hear DMF sing on the next video of a KHS production maybe? :)
too much autotune on kurt's fingers smh
I love this singer❤
I love this so much then the original I have chills
i think this song sounds better with just a piano.It's supposed to be sad and raw
I was waiting for this cover Kurt I really like this song. I love what you do because your covers are never like others' I don't mean that the other ones are bad but you make something different for each songs that's why I love you \nxx
i wish i was half as talented as kurt
Always good covers with KHS and makes me aware of performers I haven't heard of previously to check out.
Alicaaa you're back on Kurt's channel!!

OMG AMAZING  :D
TÜRKLER KENDİNİ BI BELLI ETSIN 😂
Sia e muito incrível!\nEspero que venha logo para o Brasil ♡
I love this song. I really needed this uplifting masterpiece in my life rn. I am always teased and bullied. I am LGBT and my parents called me crazy. I failed a test and my teacher told me I was a disgrace. I only have my gf and that's it. I tried to hurt myself and then this popped up in my notifications. I put the sharp object down and watched it. I never felt so alive and happy in my life. I am even happier than when I first discovered mlp. This song saved my life. Thank you. ❤️🏳️‍🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈👍🏻😭
Of course MLP 🙄
mlp...are you fucking kidding me .-.
More than beatiful THIS IS PERFECT I MUST GO TO THE CINEMA ON MLP 💕💕
This made me cry..it brings me back to when i was a little girl again thank you sia for making this song i love this
I love My little pony, G1s and g4s are my favourite, i am an original pony lover fron the 80s 😁
Why is the my little pony movie a thing
I really like the video but I think it shows too much of the movie
I'm pleased they're treating this like a real song (even though in my mind, all movie songs are real songs).
Can't wait to see the movie
I don't care about the horses but sia is queen
Sorry but its not good. Whit respect from RUSSIA.
Lol,sia has her own pony now
Osea porque my little pony jaja
Wtf is this broney shit
Well, that's the great standards. There's so many to choose from - Andrew Tannenbaum
That's like joinning the DPRK.. but it's not even free
Okay, total OCD here but the flyover shot of the ISO headquarters?  Sure those are some neat looking chevron shaped buildings, but it's going to forever bother me that two of them point inward and the third does not.   YOU RUINED THE PATTERN GOD DAMNIT.
I almost spat my tea over my computer then! 3:18
I bet it was Thatcher who approved the standard
Is there an ISO standard for the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin?
Can you please make a video about India! About anything will work, I'm sure you'll find something.
I honestly can't think of a Brazilian who have never brewed a cup of tea before besides toddlers and kids.
is this wendover productions second channel?
You can probably find the document for free online...
But the teabags used would be different so it wouldn't be the same cup of tea
Yo that line you drew for a container to go across the world.\n\nYou went the wrong way round.
You sound like the guy at Wendover Productions. Are you the same?
Love the new channel man! I can’t believe there’s an ISO standard for so many everyday things!
What kind of weirdo puts milk in tea?
I thought they were going to purchase and review a $40 cup of tea, universally heralded the international standard.
I can't imagine how much more difficult so many of our jobs would be without ISO.
No joke, but are you wendover productions?
In Switzerland you really do have to pay 40$ for some shitty tea...
well arent you going to make the actual tea??
Here in Brazil we like cold tea. Thats it
So when there's a research done with tea will the report specify it's ISO standard tea?
The USSR... No one is bringing up that Yugoslavia was also on that list
I clicked on the Skillshare link and it took me to a page that insists that I register before it will tell me anything about it. This is a red flag.
of course i find this video while drinking tea then again im British so what do you expect
Your voice is so perfect for this job!!!
DON'T YOU DARE PUT THAT MILK IN BEFORE THE WATER!
Milk first?  I'm preemptively spinning in my own grave at the thought!
Now I wanna know how to make Tea :d \nJust so I would know how I'm making it wrong...
When everyone moans about milk tea and you're there living with people that drink milk strawberry tea with maize bubbles everyday...
Don't put the milk in first, ya eejit!
All that and they never actually brewed a cup of tea?
How did people ever live 100 years ago
But I want a Nintendo Switch.
Fun fact: ISO is NOT an acronym and is pronounced “eiso” not “I-S-O”
Who thought the ISO standardized Tea would cost 40$ ? 😂
Everybody complains about adding milk to the tea\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWhile I'm here adding milk AND egg to my fucking tea
3:26 A tea standard without China? Fake standard!😂
Well how does it taste?
that's not how tea made. What nightmare
Of course the USSR approved it, they didn't even know how to make bread, do you really think they knew how to make tea on their own?
Nice transition to the sponsor
More like twice as interesting!
Ay say what you want but this is SOOOOO FUCKEN GOOD I love this series
I put the milk in my tea before the water. Otherwise the teabags will burn.
You know its gonna be a good video when 5 million brain cells die before you even get to 1:00
Give the animator a Nintendo Switch!
Who the hell puts milk in tea?
I'm Brazilian and we do drink tea, just not as much as we drink coffee though. The whole milk after or before tea thing makes no real sense, since tea isn't served with it here and it would be seen as weird.
Wait there's an ISO for cereal? Does the cereal or the milk go in first!?
3:28 the part where Turks look and go: WTF?! MILK IN TEA??
If brewed tea is add to milk then fine. But you never brew in pre milked water because the milk will slow the defusing. Yours a British Citizen UK.
This channel needs to be renamed Twice As Interesting.
40 dollars i could pay someone to brew for me ... with changes lol
Well that's because the Irish would be honoured to educate the rest of the world how to make tea, we just couldn't be arsed!
Welp it looks like the animator won't be getting a Nintendo switch any time soon.\n\n( Buying a Nintendo switch for your animator would be a better way to waste your money then a internationally recognised tea recipe. )
I thought you were going to actually make a cup of tea!  So disappointed.
I'm with the Irish on this one; YOU DON'T PUT THE MILK IN BEFORE THE HOT WATER!!!
Love the anthem in there lmao
I am British and I can happily teach you for free how to make a cup of tea, DM me lolol
Is the interesting half full or empty?
I have a Masters degree in international trade law, which might be a factor; but this is truly the best thing I have ever seen.
I hate bureaucracy... I would never pay $40 for a peice of paper.
I like the .iso file format for virtual disk images.
The reason milk was added first in historic instances was to protect the delicate bone china from shattering when hot water hit the cold cup, they added milk first so the hot water added would be slightly cooler and no cause the cup to shatter. But that is no longer the case with cups anymore, other than fine bone china.
I enjoyed the video, but I do have one critique. I’m sure you basically pulled Brasil out of a hat without realizing that they actually do drink tea there. Not the same tea like in the U.K. or the other countries mentioned, true, but they do drink tea. I lived there for just a few years and had tea all the time, often from herbs people grew at home. So yeah, may e a Brazilian researcher wouldn’t know how to brew tea like a British researcher would, but he could make some type of tea I’m sure. (My favorite I had while living there was probably camomila)
Milk BEFORE tea?! BLASPHEMY! Come, Brits and tea lovers, buck the system! TEA BEFORE MILK. *GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.*
Or the researchers could agree on how to prepare their tea so that the preparation method is uniform. And document their preparation procedure for anyone else who would want to replicate the experiment. No need to feed Eurocratic snobs $40 for that.
As an English person I belive it's a *Mortal Sin* to add milk first
I want a video on ISO for how to Wipe arse after business has been finished
This is the first of your videos I've watched, and it's hilarious. Subscribe
I have a question\n\n\n\n\nWhat's a gay bomb?
Dude, if you put the milk in first you don't have to stir... only a degenerate would put his milk in AFTER

I know this is small and picky\nIts kinda frustrating you started listing countries then stopped\nI know you were going for a joke but, \nIt felt more frustrating then funny  \nand the fast scrolling words kinda gave me a headache \nI know that last bit is personal but. . uh. . still xD\nOther wise the jokes were top notch xD
Cool. I'm gonna sue the hell out of my local Starbuck's for Not making tea by the ISO standard.
So I've been drinking tea wrong all my life!? Shame!Shame!
Is this Tom Scott? https://youtu.be/jvJzi0BXcGI
As a University student studying a science degree, I have to say, the ISO is the bane of my existence. \n\nBut I also have to say why on earth is there not an ISO for plugs/ sockets and home electricity around the world. Seriously, needing a different plug to charge my shaver and toothbrush is a right pain, then if I go on holiday to the US I am expected to wait like two hours to charge my phone half way, what is this madness, everywhere needs to just use the same plug and power (preferably the UK standard unless a better alternative is available)
The soviet anthem killed me 😂
hahaha.. 2:06 made me laugh
ISO standard teapots are weird.
Holy shit it's wendover
TThis is amazing
Soviet Accepted Tea
this is amazing
Typical globalist Propaganda
Alright... but does Skillshare conform with ISO standarts?
India approved tea!
Half as Interesting, twice as hilarious
#fuckskillshare lol
FUCK FUCK USA
that sudden soviet anthem tho
That USSR moment 😂😂😂😂
I love this
Coffee is waaayy better
Iso means big in finnish launguage lel
Because I hate money..lol
No fecken milf in me tea!
WHY IS THIS TRENDING?
Peace and love to everybody listening to this wonderful song <3 Can't wait to hear the whole album <3
I Spent the Day in Bed listening to Spent the Day in Bed
To Make You Feel That Your Mind Isn't Your Own
Spent the day in Ted
First I've liked from Moz in years. Hopefully the rest of the album doesn't dissapoint.
What are we going to do without you?
I cannot wait for his European Tour in 2018!!!
I feel some Viva Hate here and it is good feeling
Of course he spent the whole day in bed, he got sick and cancelled going out today.
The more it's heard the more I can't stop listening. Mozza for ever
Why am I just hearing this?!
Morrissey saved me. And he is still saving me.
soundtrack of my youth. now at 22 i look at it so fondly. I'm miles above everyone else my age. cause morrisey taught me such beautiful lessons about love. thank you morrisey you are a saviour in this zoo people call relationships today
As usual, the lyrics run true. 24/7 news is a cancer of the modern world.
Perfectly put, when you stop to look watch us all each day, you can't help but think, what a gigantic mess!
Should spend more days in bed and less days in the studio.  Morrissey, you used to make songs like 'That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore' and 'This Charming Man' now we get his phoned in, zero effort bullshit.  The music stinks, the lyrics stink. What the hell happened to you?  Not only are you an awful music artist but you've become an awful human being as well, in fact you've become the complete antithesis of everything that you that made you great back in the day.  The transformation of Morrissey from what he was to this is just about the most depressing story in popular music.
Stopped watching it 3 years ago, best thing I ever did.
An album track at best. The lyrics are a bit shit, tbh. Nice tune, though.
God this is catchy as fuck! I think I like it...nay...I love it.
New style Moz sounds quite modern and funky but the song retains enough of the  unique 'charm'  to keep die hard fans happy. Nicely arranged, tighter less messy with lyrics than some of the stuff from last album.
I love Morrissey but I'm gonna be honest...\nI really don't like this
Hmm, Morrissey, not his best lyrics, but this makes me think that there is something to the simplicity, that the matter of fact means something really important to him. I think my 8 year old niece could have written this but hey who cares, it's Morrissey. No bus no train Where have Morrissey's brains gone. No bus, no train, Morrissey travels by plane. Okay
And now my 2017 is blessed by Morrissey's comeback <3
I'm not my type but ... 💝
2 MONTHS FOR THIS ALBUM? FUCK
Love the political message
I love it!! Thank you Morrissey
Better stop watching TV in general .
I know morrissey loves to bitch about life and politics but I totally thought this was gonna be about bed but it took a turn ._.
Take out the 'as the workers stay enslaved' line and I'm basically on board with this single. Maybe also the 'highway, freeway, motorway' bit, I mean, what was he thinking there, y'know?
In my head I just spent the day in bed was good one cheers mozza
Sorry - Steven (I meant).
thank you
Heard it first thing this morning and if this is anything like what the new album is going to be like,well we are in for a treat,great single welcome back moz we missed you!
Not much of a risk for Moz here, kind of nice and neat and accommodating, like the World Peace Album. Nothing less, but also nothing more. Already starting to sound like his own Morrissey-Sing-a-like-impersonator, lacking the old grit in creating great lyrics. Though I have to admit: ''Pillows like Pillars'' is still a reminiscence to the old texting-craft of his.
Moz feat. the Stranglers
Not normally a Morrissey fan but really quite like this single.Lyrics are simple but good.
Morrisseys lyrics are  the story of my life
Te amo num grau, Mos!
same.
Thumbs up for lyrics
I wish Alain Whyte would come back!
THAT KID IS HOLDING AN AXE!!!!
Lmao Morissey, what is this shit?
I spent the day in bed and when I'm lying in my bed I think about life and I think about death and neither one particularly appeal to me
I stayed in bed while the workers remained enslaved \ncunt lyrics over some hackeyened organ riff out of the '70s.\nYet people will act like this is poignant, when it's really Morrissey throwing together a bunch of lines he scribbled in a notebook together.\n\nHe goes from talking about staying in bed, to about how the news sucks. There's not even any coherency, it's basically a old, whiny, white british guy ranting. You could put a backbeat behind some guy on his porch and get a similar effect.
Nope.
Do you like my cover of this song? :D http://bit.ly/2wP20EM
The MetroSexuals love you Morrissey. You're our idol. 💚
Good song, nice lyric. but, im at office :(
Just keeps getting worse. Always, expectations, dashed. Lyrics are good and fine but band can't gash a melody to save its ass.
Having Morrissey being discovered at this time of my life. I'm blown away!
Bloody genius!! Actually the best Mozzy song I've ever heard.....!!
Not a bad little tune. You know who would make it better? Johnny Marr. Those two could make beautiful music together.
the queen is not dead
The years wash away. This is 90s era Morrissey. Lovely!
This is great, normally when I spend the day in bed I put on the entire discography of the Smith's. It would be nice to run into Morrissey to chit chat about nothing and the things we hate.
This is everything The Smiths were not.\n\nWhich is why it sucks.
Love the subtle electronic tinge to it
Give up WORK as a bad mistake, moz is now telling us to take control of our destiny, he always has. I love the image as well, go on son , off with their bleeding heads, moz the king of the misanthropes, ;) LOVE HIM FOREVER
Listening to it in my bed
Great lyrics! Fighting idiocy one song at a time. Keep on delivering the goods, Moz! This filthy world still needs ya!
Yeah, I like it! If this is a taste of the album to come then roll on release date!
The moment when you're in bed reading the comments section...
im not my type but i love my bed
The Great Man Returns
Musically its pretty cool. I can't help but miss the poetic and melancholy Moz though. The cynical and blunt Moz doesn't really do anything for me. Most of his songs that take on politics or  'the system' (America Is Not the World, World Peace and this one) come across slightly superficial and condescending to my ears. \n\nHopefully there's some corkers on the new album. The last one was enjoyable, although it was the first time in his solo career that the music outshone his lyrics.
Fucking Awesome.
Funky and superb Morrissey!
💗💗💗
Brilliant
Brilliant
Bloody great! <3
Yes Morrisey!
Awesome tune if I cared.......... ;)
Beautifully woven from the eternal wondrous rebirthing grey matter of Morrissey, adored <3

Electrified Morrissey?!!!!
El Mozz siempre sorprende con algo nuevo. Me reencanta esta nueva canción. Radiable. Saludos desde Perú...
rubbish
The Moz come back en grande forme
È tornato il maestro.  Please stand up
'(I Can Afford to Have) Spent the Day in Bed' would be a better title for such an out-of-touch message in song. Has Morrissey not considered that the 'enslaved workers' he speaks of don't have the option of quitting their jobs and idling neath a duvet?\nThis man's lyrics and his observations, in song at least, used to be on-the-nail and relatable - excluding Bengali in Platforms, Asian Rut and Best Friend on the Payroll - and were last heard on America is Not the World and The World is Full of Crashing Bores (and he must be one).
Average Moz. Nothin' new. Last album was terrible, fingers crossed he sorts this one.
Amazing track that has me reeled ìn straight from the beginning with a slow drip feed. Your bed ought to be your own space as long as your thoughts do not make you a prisoner. Don't mention the M word, but Professor J Marr is in tandem in his solo way. Back in the real world, occasionally streets need to be cleaned.....As an amateur philosopher faux real (bought your books) progeny need to be inspired to do also.\nBought a couple of CDs and fab remastering labour of love job. Your singing quality in my opinion has been given a fresh choral approach. Love the range, the harmonies, et cetera. Please send us some sun, if you can. With love and respect.

I think there's a lot more going on in this movie than you give it credit for. After all the character of mother doesn't really map to the bible perfectly- there are elements that don't fit into the religious interpretations. There's a lot to unpack about relationships, about creation/art and so on. It also is quite beautiful and has amazing sound design, some great performances- it's overall extremely well made. I would really urge people to check it out for themselves as I quite enjoyed it.
DO YOU GET IT?
I understand the criticisms and the metaphors fell apart and clashed at points but I still really enjoyed the film. What stood out most to me was the sound - you could hear every step and creak.
It's like when ben affleck and warner bros said Bateman v superman was too smart for us. Go away you hacks
Which is the one where Jay says to Mike you know our first episode was like ten minutes long?
So JLaw took another shot in the face for a role? I'm shocked.
I saw it. It's was pretty good. I read and watched reviews before watching it. That might be why I wasn't so, what's the big deal? I was waiting for that I'm checking out moment. It happened 1 minute at the end. Lol
Haha, I had the same type of guy behind me after it but I got Well that was a mistake. Plebs man, gotta love em.
I don't even watch movies anymore, they merely exist as proxies for the real artists to emerge...
15:40 You don't look at a science fiction film to see our reality. \n\nBITCH YES YOU DO. Sci-fi takes truth about us and transposes it onto something that seems futuristic/advanced/different/backwards and shows us that the trappings don't matter, humanity and society still function in familiar ways.
I saw this movie without knowing anything about it, and while I was disturbed and confused it made me think, it was sort of intriguing. Now that I know what it was supposed to be I'm just angry that I was subjected to it. Sometimes ignorance really is the better option.
I'm going to like and dislike any film that my favourite YouTube channel likes or dislikes.
So it's kind of like East of Eden except shit and well, actually no it's just shit.
The only thing i know about The Wrestler is from Mickey's interview with Graham Norton about it, where he was very, very drunk all throughout the show and made other guests such as Jessica Biel feel very awkward & very uncomfortable. It was good cringe TV.
It sounds like a really stupid movie, and I find Christian allegory crap to be incredibly tedious. But I will say I appreciate that it graphically draws attention to the fact that Christianity is a creepy canabalistic bloodcult.
you guys talk about how obvious the film's message/allegory is AFTER everyone on Youtube's already figured it out and discussed it. i'm pretty sure you guys both knew what the film was about before you'd seen it. if you had posted this before everyone had already analyzed it, the criticisms would be more legitimate.
I don't get it
Thats how I felt about Anti-Christ the symbolism was so ham fisted and in your face. It feels like it was written by a first year film student.
I took this movie in a totally different way as a pure vanity piece. That Javier was Aronofsky and Lawrence was his 'normal' girlfriend trying to deal with the fans and attention her celebrity spouse craves. The people are the public and paparazzi who constantly mettle in their private life and fuck with their shit, nice to them at first and then reveal their true nature as selfish pricks. That this movie was some sore of horrible dream for the wife.... so it got really fucking weird for me at the end. So yeah, it makes more sense as a poorly re-written Bible movie, I am just not sure if it makes the movie better.
HOLY FUCK THESE SEX BOTS NEED TO STOP PLEASE
personally i think this is a critique of the bible and so it is how it is retold that makes the point. i don't buy that there has to be an independent story for a movie to work; the extra layer  jay talks about does need to exist but not only in that way. it exists here in the framing of the retelling and how it is portrayed. i now know aronofsky has specifically stated that environmentalism inspired him initially but the final form to me takes on a criticism of anything evil about humanity and its destructive tendencies and due to that evil how he views god's ultimate motives and egoism. i have no problem with how literal it is; to me it seems necessary to hammer home that this is his opinion on how the biblical events and characters should be viewed and is actually an effective rhetorical device in that regard. while there are certainly many ways to turn your opinion on an issue to film, the literalness works as a way to dress down the point by saying, alright, i will follow this perspective on an issue exactly, now see where we have gotten? the place you wind up using this method can be a way of showing an opinion by proving an alternative one unattractive. to me, darron uses this method to amazing effect here. obviously in the wrong hands this becomes ham-fisted but to me it just works to further reinforce.
I enjoy psychological horror and I liked the Witch a lot but I laughed my ass off with it as well. I don't think it's about being conditionated to jump scares I avoid any of those movies like the plague I do my research before watching a horror film but some decisions made in the Witch like the father being a useless person, some stuff with black phillip, starting with the name, don't come off as creepy for everyone.I've also heard that the kids were creepy for a lot of people but I found them pretty funny as well.
I can't stand Jennifer Lawrence. She's certainly not a talanted enough actress to shoulder the big roles she gets and such a huge amount of fame she enjoys. Could someone explain why americans are so seemingly obsessed with her?
I hate the movie even more after you explained it!!! fuck that movie!!!
Jennifer Lawrence really is insanely talented .She is the only actresses who can express every human emotion with the same blank face , truly remarkable
but what was the yellow mixture
I'm not religious so all the bible stuff went over my head, I just saw it as a movie about the creative process, and how your muse needs to go through a lot for your baby to be born (your creation). And that every time your muse is different so the process will also change. I really loved it.
You're either criticized for your symbolism being to obvious or too cryptic. Lynch had it right in my book. There's some clear symbolism, some cryptic, but overall most of his films are entertaining whether or not you get it.
Hollywood only takes a risk when it comes to pissing all over the Bible.
Are you Hacks gonna review Star Trek Discovery
so I read the reddit AMA with Aronofsky and holy shit he really is pretentious as fuck\nThe Wrestler was fantastic tho
Watch whatever whenever. The internet
Possession is highly recommended! Insane movie though..
This was a box office hit? But did it take 12 years to make?
oh wow. Wow. Jesus. That's a terrible premise.
I haven't seen the movie, but I have to say, they're being snobs about snobbery... Neon demon was good, but more often than not it was pretty in your face obvious. Even the director goes on to explain almost everything in interviews which shows he's fine with not being mysterious and just making an experience for the viewer. Again, haven't seen the movie, but an artsy movie doesn't have to be ambiguous so long as the acting (which I see was one of the complaints), visuals, and atmosphere are good. I'm fine with obvious metaphors so long the experience is enjoyable. So, if it pulls of atmosphere, I'm all in, I didn't see Neon Demon expecting The Godfather, just an interesting experience (and a bunch of messed up shit). Sometimes you really do have to shut your brain off and go for the ride and piece things together afterwards, not in the moment, which tends to ruin the experience of most art.
Jennifer Lawrence haters really need to get a life
how come eating babies is all the rage in films these days? i mean you eat one little baby in the lion king and now EVERY fucking hit film does it.\n\nif i see captain america chomp another baby down his greedy gullet, i'm going to snowpiercer joke right on over to DC to get some levity in my hero supper movies.\n\nalso mickey mouse has an approximate animated litter of 12 babies every 5 months, and we only see like... 2 alive in his shows and movies, so... do the math.
Director was quoted as saying that the US audience didn't like it because they don't believe in science.  Too bad he didn't have black people staring in the film because he could have gone with a better accusation of racism.\n\nWell there is always next time.
~best thing about this movie is the typeface . . .
I like the review of the The New Yorker movie guy who basically said its a film about an egotistical artist and his emotionalyl abusive relationship with his girlfriend.
People in my theater were super pissed afterward as well. :)
As much as I loved the movie, I actually appreciated the review. Well developed thoughts and you kept me engaged so I didn't drift away from the video. Well done, guys.
Possession mentioned! Do a re:view! That shit is nuts! Gaymarry me Jay!
Calling the allegorical elements obvious is really overestimating the intelligence of the average movie audience.  Pretty much the entire theater I was in left confused.
Paramount pictures didn't think they could sell Mother! well. They thought they could easily sell a straightforward horror movie with Jennifer Lawrence and thought they could make Mother! look like one.
Pretty surprised by Mike and Jay's vanilla reaction to this,\nI feel like film definitely has something to say beyond People are shitty to the Earth, it's a director's reflections of the violence and patriarchy inside the Bible and the culture surrounding it.\n\nIf you're looking to reduce the entire observations of this film into a neat little tagline, here you go, Monotheistic society readily worships it's holy father, a man in the stars we can't prove is there. However we neglect mother earth, our healer, nurturer and real giver of life, our home whose existence is undeniable yet we neglect her to the point of self destruction
this gay wedding storyline goes on for way too long
Unrelated very serious question: Where the fuck is Rich Evans from?!?
Keep on ripping on the corporate BS movies redlettermedia. We love ya for it
I actually really liked this. Enjoyed it much more than that clownshoes shitstain that was It
So, the couple breaking the sink, resulting in everyone getting kicked out; was that supposed to be the Biblical flood?
Thanks for telling me what I should be afraid of Jay
Mother is just creepy satanist shit disguised as Stylistic film, Aronofsky is a fucking HACK.
Amazing movie. Fuck every hater. Same pricks who bagged on the incredible The Fountain.
I saw this at a Regal Theater and it was basically a full house. Theb about 20 minutes in I think 90% of the audience checked out. Lots of talking and laughing and phone usage. Though there were 2 middle aged women sitting behind me that may have come to see it just to riff on it, because that's what they did almost from the start.
D O  Y O U  G E T  I T ?
The Witch was a fantastic movie and anybody who says otherwise can go get their nipple eaten off by a crow.
A doey-eyed wife and a husband with writers block in an abandoned house. Sounds like its one psychic child away from becoming The Shining.
Jennifer Lawrence is the pinnacle of adequate
The term is doe-eyed, referring to deer. You pronounced it as doughy-eyed because you've been reading the phrase doe-eyed incorrectly for years in your head.  Hackfraud bullshit artists.  Great review though.
Mother nature and the virgin Mary are instances of the the same archetype.
Wow, I really must have been avoiding all details of Mother! before I saw it today.  I really enjoyed the film but I didn't catch the insinuation of Christianity as the allegory of all the events taking place in the film.  So, I guess I possibly enjoyed it more because it wasn't on the nose for me.
I thought it was pretty good. I like allegories, but it did have some problems with its own and I think they ended up clashing with each other a bit too much, and the Biblical stuff is a bit shaky too once it gets past the first half. It is also true that if you ignore the allegories and look at it on the surface, it kind of makes no sense. I do still think it works as a horror movie though. At least for me, the whole idea of your house slowly being overrun with unwanted rude guests who start fucking it all up brought a real sense of dread.
Posession? You mean that weird movie they sometimes put on late at night with that chick who has an affair with a tentacle monster?
This is the best movie in a long time, i dont understand the hate for it?
Glad I watched this before seeing the movie (still haven't watched it yet) I know nothing about the Bible and that stuff so would have had absolutely no idea what the movie is about and what is going on.
i need a do ya get it soundboard rn
I know very little about the Bible so I really enjoyed this movie.
This what I don't understand:\n->You people complain theres not enough original film\n->Film landscape is oversaturated with mediocre blockbusters\n-> original thought provoking film comes out *IN A FUCKING WIDE RELEASE* \n-> complains how its too weird, pretentious and not traditional enough \n-> studios get scared and keep releasing mediocre shits
i think it's annoying to just say the film is just a retelling of the bible. I mean it does retell that story, but in a way that allows the audience to empathise with an interesting perspective. if anything, mother is an interesting exercise in story telling.
I actually really liked this movie
I'm starting to think these guys don't even know how to fix vcrs
OMG, 'The Possession' was sssooo f-ing pretentious. It is the stereotypical pretentious European film.
This is the first time I ever remember completely disagreeing with you guys. This movie was fantastic.
DO YOU GET IT?
It's a nice christian film, Grandma
lol did anyone else see the trailer for this in theatres and it had one of those 2000s era dramatic male voice overs that more or less said THIS WILL MESS YOU UP
human bad. no more human. earth good. stop human make earth bad.

Fuck you guys.  You used to be funny, and when I say funny, I mean relevant.  Regards, Goat from Ruthless Reviews.
Fuck you, I liked it.
Also your review of Jennifer Lawrence's acting is laughable. Only haters agree with you; the overwhelming majority of reviews say otherwise. Her performance is extremely nuanced. It is often eye movements and gestures and body language and tone in a part that is by design emotionally restrained until the end. That is the point. You need to look at her eyes. Extremely expressive performance. And since we are at it, how many different facial expressions do virtually any actors make in a part? It seems that you are so pressed to criticize that you came up with nonsense. And she did not go for it? Give us a break. You guys are not that bright but you think you are. That is tedious. Wannabe hipsterism. Hipsters are threatened by talent. Well too bad.
The guy on the left is Mr plinket right
Well I liked it
i'm having a hard time telling what redlettermedia considers a good movie. just cuz mother is a movie with a lot of symbolism and biblical references, it's bad? while mike liked movies like jurassic world, a blatant piece of shit. i usually respect redlettermedia's opinion, but i'd really like to know what they consider a good movie. cuz if jurassic world is a good movie but mother is not, then i'm not sure what exactly these guys' priorities are.
Do you guys remember when Mike used to make the strongest points?

「Nani??」
Super feliz por você ter voltado !!! Is Comming Back Avicii
HELLO, CAN YOU HELP ME REACH MY 50 000 SUBS GOAL? I KNOW YOURE THE BEST PEOPLE!!!!
Biscoff is dangerous. If you taste any of it you will have eaten the entire jar before you know it.
I’m gonna infuse chocolate chip cookies into the milk, add burnt butter and brown sugar to the custard, and make cookie dough ice cream!
I think that infuse the biscuits in the milk is a genius idea!!! Great Jemma :D
As someone who's never tried biscoff spread and who lives in a country where it cannot be found I would absolutely LOVE a biscoff recipe so that I can try it myself <3 Love your videos, Jemma!
Am I the only one who would freeze the left over biscuits and eat them?? Lol
Is that apron merch?!? Please can you release merch jemma!
Digestive biscuits 😍
Lotus speculoospasta, something typical from belguim😊! Love it. greetings from our small country belguim!
How am I supposed to dip this in my tea?
She speaks sometimes soooo fast so I think I am out of breath 😂
Biscoff a good tasty Belgian product. I eat it every morning for breakfast with bread. I eat the biscoff crunch. So njammy.
Α very good job!!!
Yummy
Yuuuum! I want some right now haha
Mmmmm delicious.. i want some :)
Yummy!
AAAH YES ICE CREAM
Cool idea
MashAllah
Surely that now just tastes of biscoff...
Hi Gemma i love your recipes
This looks so yummy!,
Hi jemma your very inspiring
Yum !!!!
1st
I totally feel like I wouldn't make the S'mores Alaska because I'd be eating this straight up - or with caramel sauce and a pinch of salt, because I'm fancy with my ice cream.
hello Jemma! Would you mind to share about how to make foundant? thank you very much!
Bij die volgende was echt nirt goed echtvies
Was all like 'Yeah! So making this!'... then you pulled out an ice cream maker which is none existent in my life right now 😢 x
Yemma show us a vlog with your boyfriend
hey ,sorry but do i hv to use ice cream machine? can i just freeze it bcz in my country , ice cream machine is quiete expensive
Can you do this if you haven't got a ice cream machine
What do you do with the leftover biscuit mush?
Hey Jemma, your comments section is being hijacked by bloody idiots advertising other X-rated channels. Never seen this before. Can you stop it! They're pathetic creatures and don't deserve to breathe.
What ice cream maker brand and model did you use? :)
Hi Jemma, I have watched many of your videos and they are  amazing! One day i want to be like you and even better.I hope you get my message and answer it in your next video. 😍
Who knows why digestive biscuits smell so good when mixed with butter?
yummy and tasty biscuit ice cream  i want to meet with you and try all your recipes
Hi Jemma, could you teach us how to make digestive biscuits at home? I live outside the UK but I miss them so much, and so do allmy friends who have ever tasted them.
Here's something I wanted to ask for quite some time but never got around to. What happens with the leftover stuff? Like for example the soaked biscuits from the milk or the biscoff in the piping bag. Similarly you often seem to end up with a lot of leftover cupcake batter or icing and I really don't like wasting ingredients. Maybe that's a dumb question but do you make additional quantities or something like that with what's leftover or do you just throw it out?
What if you don't have an ice cream Maker, what do u do pls
I pray for myself, one day I will meet u in person! Thank you for inspiring me, as always! Love from Indonesia, Jemma! 💙
Aww Jemma! I was hoping to hear, ‘it’s a really fine... a fine mesh you’ve got me into haha’. Any other long time subscribers here? They’ll understand the reference. Love that recipe and video.
Is there anything you can do with the biscuits other than throwing them out after infusing the milk?
Everything homemade is better, plus u know whats going into it.
You don't use the speculoos pasta... I am dissapointed, that is why I clicked on the video. I still want to try the recipe though
SO need to give this a try!!! 😍
What kind of ice cream machine is that one?? I want it!!!
Biscoff alone is out of this world, so tell me how can I resist this ice cream one? 😭😍
I love u Jemma and I wish I could come to your shop but I live in Manchester not London 😟 but I'll come one day for sure
Oooh I'm gunna make this, but with bourbon creams...
Ooo good job, Jemma. You're #15 on trending in UK 🎉🎉🎉
Love you Jemma I look up to you with cooking you're amazing I just wanna meet you and eat all of your cakes!
Early!!!!\nThat looks good
Wow thanks for the ice cream inspirations!
Is it me or i'm learning so much vocabulary from here. Like Wacky, Ladleful, etc hahahaha
Hey Jemma, I was wondering: If you wanted more of the biscuit milk to avoid diluting the flavor too much, could you maybe put the solids into a clean kitchen towel after the majority of the liquid has drained and squeeze more from it? Or do you think more solids may be pushed through the fibers of the towel or there probably wouldn't be enough liquid left to worry about?
Hey 🦄 this is Lilly \nLilly has no friends \n1 like= 1 friend \nLet's see how many friends Lilly can get
Ugh I love watching these videos 😛
If I come to UK I wish I could get the Jemma kitchen towel hanging at the back hahahaha
What is that ring?!?  =)
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
So sad and angry. Wrote a message here. And now i got all those girls who wanna show there body to me. First i'm a married woman and i'm not interested in some hot Girl or man 😩😖😤 Not funny
This is so inspiring ! \nMy friend linked me this cake site yesterday and i can highly recommend it guys, you get personal videos on recipes and how to prepare cakes for partys, weddings etc, and you get also a access to communication forum there you can ask the professional patissier for help, live! Iam so exited, give it a cake guys :D ! https://tinyurl.com/y7j2rm6s

What's the substitute for double cream? Heavy whipping cream?
I don't mind using cream in my deserts but using milk is off putting. Would this work with soy milk?
i must be noticed to subscribe
U should have used a cheese cloth to get the rest of that milk out!!
Can we make. It without the ice-cream machine?
Would it be a bad idea to add a little bit of vanilla extract or essence to this ice cream? Would it effect the way it hardened or the consistency or something else strange that I've not thought of?
Is there a recipe for biscoff? I've never heard or seen it before😐😐.
But I don't have an Ice cream machine. What do I do
Recipes like this, makes me hate my dairy allergy. Because then I start rationalizing how much of this I could comfortably eat without needing to go to the hospital lol
Ugh...$233 for that model on Amazon. I know you buy the best, but are there cheaper cuisinart ice cream makers that give you the same results?
She must have the runs.
I would have a hose ready and let it rip if she stepped on my lawn. It's, well, crap.
I know who this is!
That’s no woman! It’s a man BABY!
Maybe the family is from jersey... and Jewish.
💩 maybe she's getting back to the neighbors that have dogs that are 💩in her yard.
Mental Illness run a muck.  One report said the person was a transsexual and since sex change went mentally unstable.   It is no excuse.  Some body should shoot it and blowout the knee caps.  At that point the police can go by and baker-act the mook.  enough said
Just heard that it's a tranny that got some botched surgery and can't control it's ass sphincter.  EeeeeeeeEEEEEEeeeeeew!
THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. FIBER.
Maybe she should marry Anthony Weener. Then they could have kinky sex in prison.
Dedicated runner.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-QV5zCNyKk
shit for brains
she should be labeled as a sex offender like a man would.
_As I jog through a hood become bitter_\n_I try my best to be much more fitter_\n_You see I can't  be called or say quitter_\n_But now  it seems my life's a big shitter_\n\n_I must confess a shame; my butt's blooper_\n_I leave a pile of dung that they snooper_\n_For me to stop my crap would be super_\n_Beware I am of your adept troopers_\n_For they, like you, call me, The Mad Pooper_
I bet she's really a guy
Close encounters of the turd kind.
Spray her with a hose or pepper spray.
Hey! I live at Briargate and Union!
Now they are claiming she has mental issues. NO DOUBT. Get some diapers and pick your shit up nasty bitch.
They should turn this into a movie and call it  Turdinator.
Welp you have your Guns, Americans\n\nUse them now, get off my feckin lawn
No surprise she has a short hair cut
THESE SHIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENTS MUST STOP!! THE POLICE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THIS SHIT!!
I can bet u my left nut that poo woman is a crooked Hilary supporter.. 100%
something smells funny about this story
I did a search and noticed that most of the people caught shitting in public are women. ....Fairer sex my fucking ass!  ....goddamn nasty fucking bitches.
whats most disturbing is that this shit is trending!
Shouldn't be too hard to follow her to her home ! then the neighbourhood could shit on her all casually like!!!!
She has the runs !!
I'd kick her face
She was originally from ridgefield nj
Maybe she's afraid of toilets. i saw a case on another lady that did the same thing and she couldn't stop. i couldn't believe that back then but now i'm seeing that it must be a real fear smh
Fuck it, take are shit
Indian’s do this all the time
These are really shit jokes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHa get it
It's been happening for 4 fucking years I just saw a video from 2013 and we're in 2017 lol
were in a simulation, this player just having some fun
oi\nnow people are into people pooping and taping it\nWTF!!!!!\n\nBOMB THE US!!!!\n\nTHE END\n::))
What a crappy thing to do
When you think you can run home from Chipotle thinking you can make it but you don't
to get her to cut the... Well, you know...\n\nThat was edgy. hahaha
Oh man. I'd love to know this woman's identity. I'd create a website MadPooper.com and plaster this nasty woman's name, face, and news story all over it.
If a man flopped his dick out to piss the jail but a woman bears her arsehole a shits and it’s maybe kinda warn her before she faces chargers
I'd be mad too if some bitch dropped plunkets in my yard.
I want to see the video
What a nasty cunt! Especially if there are bathrooms near by. If she has a bowel problem, she needs to wear Depends! Seriously, wtf is wrong with this bitch?
She's a freak must be a turn on
The amount of puns! 😂
Expecting more of this shit now that automation is phasing out low IQ workers who will eventually turn to this crappy behavior since they are without jobs
Honestly, there are things more important and newsworthy than this shit........... oh wait
No one ever has to deal with this shit
I guess she had the shit ran out of her
I hope when she goes to jail, that her cellmate and the warden both take lots of shits on her face.
I'd unload a paintball gun right in her ass crack... That would make this shit bitch very easy to find ;)
Reminded me of Jackass-taking a shit while running at full-speed video XD
WTF WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, once a week we find a shit outside our toilet at our restuarant. hope they stop
To solve this run after her punch her cunt in there u go
I would eat it
I say some full auto paintball to the ass is much needed.
Your kids were crying. because of this? Fuck off and die you cretin.
Its a shit and run folks!
Instead of taking pics just follow her nasty ass home
She just needs the shit beat out of her.
Oh don't worry, in about a year time all of the feminists will be pooing outside because it's liberating and natural and whatnot. She is just starting another retarded trend.
she's a bad ass (literally)
What the fuck is this shit?
lol but when a naked dog shits in front of you it's just fine
FREAK.

let's do some crowdfunding over the BootlegZone forums and get it!!
If the master tape is missing, and this acetate is the only copy that exists, then couldn't it be argued that the disc is the property of Calderstone/Apple? If they wanted to intercede and stop the sale, could they legally do it? And even if they did, would they be more or less likely to release it than the highest bidder?
They should release a new collection of curios like this. There's loads of stuff. It doesn't have to be a commercial project. Just do it via the website or even a net database like Springsteen and Neil Young are doing.
Nice. I remember hearing this on the Lost Lennon Tapes back in the '80s, about 30 years and 80 pounds ago.
Shame on you for selling this. Things like this belong in a museum so everyone can enjoy it not just rich people.
Please release it... don’t hold the song hostage for a sale.
Do you have I call your name if it was recorded this early?
Not a snippet! Just a teaser. Give the world this great rendition of a piece of history. I demand thee!
Wow. Just Wow!
Awesome !
Holy crap.  Grail.
one word: awesome-tacular!!!
amazing

I literally love your bun.
Gabbie, can you PLEASE release a karaoke version for out loud?
This made me cry
That's so relatable that's happened to me but with a different dream and it was so creepy😶
Dude this gave me chills not even lying. Holy crap! I've had my fair share of experiences with ghosts and mediums. I feel this story deep to my coreeeee. Also you're looking really good! Keep up the great work Gabbie! (MISS YOU)
that back ground music tho! out loud
That sounds like a type of night terror and sleep paralysis but I hope it is more like what you said cause that would be cool
aawe you posted this on my birthday :)
is it jus me or is out loud the background music for this vid lol. i highkey love it tho i could listen to it for daysssss <3 <3
I know it won't last long cause Hey its me lmaoo
Always love your story time! It is my favorite segment that you do <3 I have missed it!
Can u bff me on musical.ly I musername is @dilnoor_k (pls)
Gabby, I was startled during this video, your story telling skills are out of this world.
is her song the background music?
Damn girl you look so good in this video work it!!
It's my friends b day pls like my comment
Sleep Paralysis, All the symptoms of it, you had one of the more realistic dreams, most of the time its just like a home-invasion or something like that but you got something scarier
Its not just the living ones it's all of them dead 😂
I love how out loud is playing in the background
The numbness and tingles happen to me constantly as I'm about to go to sleep and think of something that is too creepy for my brain to sleep at. I try moving but it doesn't work. I once imagined a creepy doll because I was scared of the dark in my mother's bedroom after she asked me to sleep with her that night. (I am a teenager and still scared of the dark....yeah) and I just coundn't move. I knew the paralysis was coming if I kept thinking, but my thoughts didn't stop, and I couldn't move.\n\nThis happens more frequently and on demand than when I was a child. When I was younger I had a dream of this king with a humungous head and he had powers. One day I had accidentally disrespected him, and he tried to kill me. I woke up, but when I opened my eyes, I was still dreaming. I could still see my ceiling, my body, but my dream was still going. I could barely moved, but somehow I moved my arm over to the other to see if I could pinch myself awake. It didn't work, and I woke up right before he killed me.
Just noticed that when she said Muk she put a picture of Muk from Pokemon 😂
i wish gaby was my best friend
Gabbie looks so pretty in all of her thumbnails
Gabby I swear I'm crying when u talked about how ur afraid that ur great grandma was trapped or something I just was upset I was think what if that really true and I just feel horrible omg I'm so sorry for ur lose btw
Did yall see that she has a station in pandora?
When I watched this I got up to get a snack and then my vision got black and I felt like I was cold but I wasn't. Then I heard something fall and I was looking at it when my vision was back I felt like someone was controlling me. This started about a month ago. I'm scared if something happens to me if it happens again...
You are so pretty
Please do more ghosts!! I think I am haunted to...
GABBIE. I LOVE YOU BUT I WANTED TO SAY. \n\nI CAN SEE YOUR BRA!!
Honestly, I used to really like Gabbie, The reason I dislike her now is due to how she treats other people because of how large her following is. If you have no clue to what im talking about search HeyImbee and watch her video 'A big Youtuber was rude to us' And after that there is an evidence video that makes it clear that it was Gabbie, all of the evidence matches up and honestly i dont know how i didn't see how stuck-up she was before. I'm sorry, i'm just being brutally honest and stating my opinion.
You look gorgeous in this!😍
OMG I'M SO HAPPY U CAME TO PITTSBURGH PA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I LIVE
Is it just me or is that out loud in the back ground lol
Gabby looks so good in this video I’m shook
Omg gabby is so pretty!!!! She's so beautiful and perfect the way she is!!!!!!!!!! Damn how does she not have a boyfriend!!!! She's my spirit animal and btw I love ur new song!!!!!! LIKE YASSSSSSSSSSSSS QUEEN SLAYYYYYYYYYY

You look bueatiful in this gab!♡
The Gabbie Show I had a dream once it was that I met you but I know that is never gonna happen coz I live to far away but I wish dreams really did come true so I could meet u. This sounds like a poem but it's not promise and there is 1% chance that you'll see this but I love u
O My God!! your hair colour looks so natural!!
You should make a video  about  your dreams snd some of the most interesting you've had
currently home alone while watching this and just saw a silhouetterun into my nanas room. Freaking out rn
Gabbie this happens a lot to people. Especially people who someone is trying to reach out to. What you went through IS REAL. I know you won't read this but in the Jesus literally says he'll is real and if you don't believe in him you will go to hell. I'm not saying this to get mad at you 😂. But your grandma might be a warning. Look up toddwhite testimony X I love ya girl I just wanted you to see this. 
I HAVE THE SAME SHIRT AS YOU F21 LITTT LOVE YOUUU
The other side\n\nVampire diaries fans where you at? 😂
Didn't see already tell this story like years ago
I'm sorry that your Great Grandma had died. So sad 😭! I feel for you.
Hey gabbie if your seeing this earlier I commented saying that I subscribed to your channel and following you on Twitter hope this can make your day😊😊😀 and love your new hair style👍👍👍👍👍👍 PEACE✌
gabbie, you probably wont notice this but ages ago you made a video about you getting catfished by best friends what if that was a ghost, because ghosts try to ruin your life.please look at this comment it would make me really happy, bye.;)
YOU ARE UGLY AF DELETE YOUR CHANNEL UGLY ASS GIRL VERSION OF PINNOCHIO
I called my sister IMMEDIATELY, well after I vlogged it 😎
I know exactly the kind of dream you're talking about! I had dreams about my husband from the time I was a little girl. I never saw his face in my dream but I had the same feeling (only I didn't wanna run lol) and when we met his face was finally revealed! I know it's weird. Lol
did anyone notice that her shirt is slightly see through
Omg that's so freaky
GABBIE IS FRICKEN GORGEOUS
YOU HAVE TO REACT TO MIRANDAS OUT LOUD VIDEO!!!
this makes me happy because it reminds me my grandmas still watching over me and she wont forget me <3 <3 <3
Oh no! I spotted a mistake in your book!!! Poem TIME on page 50 starts with 'isn't is funny'. I believe it was meant to be 'isn't it funny'. BTW I love the book and song.
Plus the fact that the lyrics of the chorus of Out Loud creepily match up to her grandma and the dream 😬😬😬😬
Wow Gabbie u lost weight! \nYou look so healthier !!\nSo proud of you!💙💙
My dreams are weird like I have feelings and the faces are always blurred but it's like I know who they are
I have the same dream types!!!
PLZ Dont say bad words
Ow mygod
Gabbie is so pretty💞💞
that's scary af dude.
Holy fuck im scared
WOAH
This was so beautiful I love the fact that you are so pure, with a beautiful spirit and oh so open!!! I love you jhene thank you for letting us all know what  its like to deal with pain
that’s cute , you’re cute
This made me cry. I lost my brother a few years back. I was 14 he was 15.I don’t count the years, because I just don’t & I’m 22 now. But before I saw the film it’s like something told me it will have to do with her brother. And yet everything she said when she spoke about his loss is exactly what I felt. Anyone who lost a sibling will feel this. ❤️
Jhene Aiko is such a creative being, who came on the earth to share her creativity with the world.\nthis is SOUL FOOD !!! thank you Jhene thank you
What is the song at 15:20 plz help
Thanks a lot 😭now I can’t stop crying.
This was good , I'm so proud of her it made me a little sad but I love you Jhene. ❤
So beautiful!! Loved it so much! Can't stop listening to the album!!
Omg this had me in tears!!! I felt every part of this short film! Love it!
I was a sunken ship, a drunken sip of something thick. Godamn this is so deep! This remind me so much of Poetry Justice. she lost someone and was scared to love again.
I WAS CRYING THIS WHOLE VIDEO. JHENE IS A TRUE ARTIST.
Oct 5th 2016, we lost our pawpaw and I swear every question every feeling she reflected or asked, I need to know and I continuously feel... Never ending pain... I miss him and never want to forget him...
I just love her she’s so amazing & perfect in so many ways !
I fucking cried 😩\nFollow me on IG @iamjoseanmusic xo one love
Why doesn't this have more views ???
I don't like the part of you kissing that dude
Ughh I sobbing! I'm super close with my brothers and the tought of losing them eats me alive. I can't imagine what she's going through. She is always mentioning her brother, singing about him, talking about him and posting about him. I wish you get a mind peace jhene, I hope your brother is in a safe place watching you grow up and shine and smiling! I love you! You're one of a kind!
whats the song that starts at 15:05 ????
what is every song in this movie
Lost my grandma in April the day just before Easter and this really hit the spot....im crying 😢😭
I want to take a trip  I just wish I could pack up my bags and just go somewhere, somewhere without a destination.
So creative this spoke to my soul ❤
i can't even relate but I still cried😢
Broke the replay button button. Truly inspiring album. She DID that !
This was beautiful. There’s nothing else I can say.
Am I the only one obsessed with the animated scene at 13:03 ? I freaking loved the beat and the psychedelic vibe.
This was so very emotional 😭
Omg i loved this so much. I feel the pain jhene. RIP Miyagi
I need that version of while we’re young omg
Why is it 2:30 am and did I stop writing my thesis to listen and watch this whole labor of love?! I have been here watching this, when I just started crying. This just speaks to me on another level. I had to pauze the video twice because I could not see anything anymore due to my tears. Sometimes I don't think I can genuinely feel until things like this happens. This has been one of the happiest sad moments in my life. Just wanted to let you know 🖤🖤
I feel the vision
yaaas jhene just fuck me up had me all in my feelings
9:05 the way the sun just passes...  And she's still there,  staring 😭😭😢😢.  And this so open and honest.  Such vivid emotion
“ that’s cute , you’re cute “ omgggggg
As beautiful as the album itself. This was truly poetic and I am forever inspired by the power couple that is TWENTY88.
I’m seriously crying ❤️ losing someone that was so close to you is the hardest man
There are no words to describe the beauty I just witness.
Did anyone catch that the guy who plays Dante in this is the same guy who's plays the waiter in the While we're young video?
This was so beautiful. I'm so proud of her like guys you don't even knoooowwww.
I couldn’t stop crying. I love this so much and makes me appreciate my family more. I don’t know what i would do without them
Big Sean bout to catch a body......
Awww i said we needed a visual😍
To be complete you have to be empty I LITERALLY BURST INTO TEARS. That shit home so hard.
This was refreshing and beautiful work. She has grown so much since she first started. Jhené Aiko & Tracy Oliver 👏👏😍😍 Who else has watched more than once??
I Love Jhene Since Mirrors came out .❤️ so real and so pure ❤️!! Omg 😩😩😩😩😩😩 the fact this whole video is ab her makes me love even moreeeeee omg 💕 I'm in love babygirl . Always been yourself !!

apple.co/JheneAikoBeats1
i cried.. I love you Jhene
I have never had an easy,\nAnd fuck you if you don't believe me,\nAnd fuck me for crying over spilled milk,\nThat I never plan on drinking
What song is playing on 19:43??
Beautiful absolutely beautiful , made me so emotional ❤️🙏🏾
this made me cry...
Your album is so inspiring!!!!! Your music is so nice and relaxing and thought provoking!!!! never stop.
Omg She Puts My Depression To Sleep.  I Cut Often But When I Hear Her Voice Its Like Im At Peace If It Wasnt For Her Music I Would Probably Be Dead Her Music Moves Me So Much Shes The Reason I Keep Going .Thank You Jhene And Is The Song At 19:44 Out Yet ???
I love this ... so real .. so deep \n\nIf I only I had that same bond with my brother ,\n\nStill living, but feels like he not even in it \n\nNo hi's , how are you?  \n\nNothing \n\nI miss him \nBut it doesn't seem to phase him 🙁😥\n\n💙💙💙💙
Omggg i havent cried that deep in a long time 💔 amazing.
Why is this so relatable?
this was beautiful! what’s the name of the song at the end? 💕
She’s my spirit animal! That was beautiful.
I would have thought this was beautiful and authentic, if I had a vagina
Fuck her for being so perfect 😫
I feel for her on a different level we relate so much ❤️ I really love her she is a true artist
I've replayed this all morning. 💔 I lost my nephew; one year in October, but his mother (my sister) raised me as her own. I haven't made the best choices since he left.. it has been so hard living knowing he is not here. I am still not ready to let him go.. in my culture we Believe by us not letting them go, they are stuck.. wandering... So I can definitely relate to this. Thank you Jhene Aiko 💕
Your grieving process is almost parallel to mines. A lot of times I feel like dying is the only thing that will bring me closer to the people I truly love and I push away the new people that try to enter my life with my shenanigans. Getting high helps get me by not people. This was a pretty dope ending in that we are all one there is no direct separation between Life and Death. Love you ❤️ keep grieving and showing us that even stars go through the same things we do.
Wow no words for how talented and beautifully creative and wonderful free spirited soul this woman is. This made me cry...
I felt the heartbreak, I had to take a couple deep breaths. This is beautiful
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS PHENOMENAL ACTING THO??!?!?!!!???????? Bravo Miss Jhene!!!!!!! She did that!!!!
I cried! I love when she does projects like this! I can’t wait to listen to the album, I can’t wait for more from Twenty88! I’m in love!
I Cried through the whole thing but was smiling at the end, thank you for this video ,you were trying to heal yourself but you helped me heal too😫 Thank you.
We're all the same in different ways\nLove Her And SZA
Women are so much more spiritually in tune it's crazy I am just starting to realize this.
Jhene is good for my soul
So beautiful, I'm crying 😭😭
need to get this album ASAP!
very inspiring
I Love Her And She Is So Poetic😍😍😍
love this.
love this!
Prolific.
Girllllll 😢😔💔
❤
lol this shit makes me cringe hard..
Love this album
beautiful
When she calls him honey❤️
you could make a lookbook based off of your favorite movie characters <3\nyou could also make a vlog-type video taking us shopping with you (clothes, makeup, knick-knacks, etc)\n\nlove you arden! =)
Please make more of these
You could do a PR haul! Or just do what jenna marbles is doing and make a video that you wanna make, like do something random you've always wondered about or try something for the first time and share your experience. Or I would love to see what you would wear (both face and outfit) on a night out!
you guys should do a google deep dive! it would be so hilarious
i feel like you guys are ridiculously pretty and cool and your lives are codirected by will (a costar) and wes anderson and i just want to see you guys browse the accidental wes anderson subreddit while a 360 degree tracking shot happens around your perfectly symmetrical table while you’re wearing bright red button ups and watercoloring yellow tents
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! ALL THOSE STARTER PACKS LMAO
1. Driving with Arden and Will (love y'all together!)\n2. Fall favorites\n3. Try something new/different (could be foods or an activity)
yes 10/10 would watch more like this
The I'm not interested starter pack is me when I'm interested lol maybe thats why everyone stops talking to me
pj liguori background music i'm living
I would love if you guys did this style with your podcasts
Reddit is a great, fun place. I would love more videos like this!
HOneY !!! make this a series plssss
THIS IS HIGH QUALITY CONTENT
Looking for a new channel to watch?! Great me too so check out mine and you won't be disappointed! :D
Loved this! Please do more together. This is probably one of my favourite videos from you Arden & Will - thank you 😊
Ironically I feel like a how to keep productive video or how to have a relaxing evening or a how to de stress vid would be cool I think you will do well with those because I haven't seen many done before!
Do a video reacting to your old videos! or your first video
This was fucking precious and hilarious
Ah! Some great subreddits to check out: malicious compliance // prorevenge // tales from retail
Definitely keep doing these they’re great
love this!! and also where is that sweater from?? i need it!
I love this vid! But u guys made me feel so single :(((
this is one of my favorite videos you guys have made
Never seen Arden high until now
this is some quality content right here
this should be a weekly installment
What are you actually doing with your life
Your shirt looks like my school uniform
Arden you should just become a meme reaction channel
omg will 6:·0 did you.. lied to me? so cuteeee you guys i love your relationship and maybe some videos about decorating and ikea and things like that and maybe some cooking videos we all loved you guys together!! so easy you just gotta be yourself and make videos we really watch this channel nd will's because we love you :) greetings from Mexico also, if you would like to use your platform for help I would really appreciate it, with the earthquake things has gotten pretty serious a lot of people are homeless now and a lot of people still burried under the buildings :( even little kids :( if you would like to share info about donation of curse you can make sure the site and info is true i would suggest donating via amazon, unicef and carlos slim foundation, red cross you sharing the links really means the world to us Arden. :( love from México!
I love seeing both of your reactions, it was cute yet hilarious. Do some more of these meme videos +ardenrose
Wait this was so entertaining to watch thank you for posting omg
Does anyone else feel like Arden is more obnoxious when will is around? Like she laughs at nothing. I like memes but most of these were just ok
Please do this again I loved this so much 💕
Superman had an Earth dad so it kind of makes sense.\n\nI think the joke is more Batman's parents (but he's pictures as a kid when he may have had a mom).
Make a video with Andrea!!
Pleaaaaase keep doing this, i loved it
You could do the Closet Confidentional tag x
I NEVER FELT SO SINGLE IN MY FRICKIN LIFEE
Who else thought it was Brad Hall in the thumbnail?
The woman seems more like of a boyfriend than the guy.
sex pistols poster in the background 😍
you're out of his league... just saying.
Girl great vídeo. Could you make some more about adult life? 🖤
Will looks like a combo of Austin Butler and Bill Skarsgard which is NIIICE & Arden is so flippin beautiful!!
would seriously love another week in my life vid or something of the sorts
Do a video on your jewelry! Loved this video😀
more! i loved it
i fucking loved this content holy shit
I loved this because I'm too lazy to open reddit by myself HEE HEE
The kind of content I signed up for. 👌👌
make this a series
It's okay I'm from Cornwall... and in Truro I saw a guy shouting from a roof once in Lemon Quay for hours.. Cornwall news is odd
where is your top from? its amazing
haha tru tru! I've never been to reddit. My life is so much better thanks!
yay I loved this and all the banter!!
The Truro from that article is actually in Canada. I've been there and, believe me, it's not a beautiful city
I like this a LOT. A lot a lot.
i would love to see a vinyl collection video by arden
I need more than one like button for this video
Honestly I was screaming and snorting. I never once snorted in my life
Ahahahah they're like Ethan and Hila but the world hasn't broken them
You guys are like cute grandparents 😂😂😂😂😂
it was so funny when you realized what the condom said but then re realized that it had a donut jajajajaja make it a series who cares
this is like the perfect video i need on youtube, couples just laughing at memes while wearing nice clothes.
I feel like this is a really good and funny video segment of Crash On My Couch, loved it
wow I can't wait till y'all get married
You two are such a sweet couple! Travel videos are always cool, but even little videos about exploring your city are always fun to watch. You could do your take on the old home videos that parents would make to capture your life at this moment in time. Discuss movie reviews of what you should actually watch that's out in the theaters right now. If none of those seem like a good idea maybe opt for videos on your option about today's society (societal pressures, observations you've made, fashion, androgyny). Also you could do a video comparing your upbringing with Will's and seeing how it was affected by the country you grew up in :)
This was hilarious! I haven't laughed this hard at a video in ages. Please do more 👌🏻
ur intro is so lovely?
i liked this alot
DO IT MORE
More please!!
MAKE MORE OF THIS PLZ
please do this again and again and again
Ooh do this more!! It's super funny!!!
Baking videos! Vlogs (I love when y'all do that), playlist videos (like what you're listening to now)!!!
I would watch a weekly one of these not gonna lie
THANK U YESSS U FINALLY MADE A VIDEO WITH WILL THIS IS WHAT I LOVE MOST
Loved this. Haha

I'm so confused, but okay.
I had no idea Samwell Tarly was gay. I mean, he did bone Gilly.
Woahhhh, this was so cool. Black Mirror asf. Go Chris, your channel is killing it!
OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD
Chris your vids are the best :) great writing and production
Holy  shit\n\nI didn't see that coming
News flash.... don't mix dark liquor and hallucinogenics. Problem solved
Well... That was unexpected.. M. Night should take notes.
Oh. My. Gawd! The production value on this thing is unreal! It's a legit movie.... he should win some kind of something for this...he's so talented! This is hilarious AND looks amazing
PLOT TWIST
THESE ARE AMAZING
!!!!!!!!!!!
Chris should go on talk shows or something to boost his subscriber numbers. He's so friggin good and I live for these videos, I wish he had more support
This shit blew my mind omg good job chris
Watching this a second time gives me such a different perspective
SH SH SH SH SH SH\n*SHUT THE FUCK UP*
This is awesome!! Great work!!!!
It's so fukked up
So many fucking plot twists in a video. This is a fucking 10/10. Great fucking job . Best thing that happened to Chris was leaving buzzfeed
This was weird ... but cool!
YOOOO THIS WAS SO GOOD. That twist thooo
Well... This got dark
i fucking love your videos man !! inoticed you dont publish content that offen but when you do its a whole trip!!
That fucked me up man great video
haha\nnice chris\nwas fun last time seeing u at buzz\ni would love to see your new videos weekly
WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS\nTHIS IS AMAZING
this channel is so clever how does he not have more subs?
Calling it now. Chris Reinacher is the Millenial answer to David Lynch.
Im going to start needing to emotionally prepare myself before watching Chris videos XD
That was so fucking good!  What?!?!?!!!
For some strange reason the straight one looks gay and the gay one straight to me.\n\n\n\nEdit : OMG i didn't even see the end!! I'm shooocked
This was really smart
This is like a gay version of fight club
holy SHIT I LOVED THIS
Im so fucking confused. Can someone please explain the jist of this to me?
So I did see that coming, but you came at it from a different angle than I expected - well played and excellently produced as usual :)
NO.. \nNOOOO \nthis is too much\nthis ruined my evening \ngoddammit..
Omg this was absolutely amazing. If I wasn't a fan before, I'm definitely one now!
If your girlfriend has a gay friend, then dump her ass cause she's blowing someone else
Oh, and you're a ghost. 😂
normalizing the type of shit murder suicides happen over!
I'd like to eat your girlfriend's pussy out.
87k views is not trending. How much did you pay YouTube
Doesnt she say have a good gayte at the beginning ? I thought it all at the beginning
Oh! and you are a ghost... That makes sense!
I had to pause the video after she said he was the gay friend cause it was too painful for me to process that. 😭😂
Nobody can come between me and my fag hag.
my goodness! how do you even come up with this stuff! <3 fav
so glad you broke off and did your own thing, this content is AMAZING, I love the creativity <3 keep it coming
But why is it when the plot twist occurs the main character starts talking like a gay stereotype? And starts gesturing flamboyantly to show how communicating with crazy hand movements is intrinsically gay? Everything else was good, but the gay character  representation at the end is kind of offensive. I thought we moved past the effeminate gay tropes.
Fantastic! This was cool and creative. More of this on youtube!
EASILY my favorite video this WEEK!\nLMAO
Dude, make a movie.  Please,  for all of us
Hey Chris, just wondering if you'd ever think to release a behind the scenes video for this? I love the editing and vfx as I am currently a first year Screen Prod student; always looking to pick up some inspo wherever I can!! Cheers
THIS MADE NO SENSE IT CONFUSES MY MIND AAA\n\nEdit: Wow watching it a second time really changes things.
He's the gay friend and a ghost coming this fall to fox
that was the fastest 7 minutes of my life
after watching this I gotta wonder... am I the gay friend???
OH SHIT WHAT A TWEEST
Amazing. Hope Chris makes videos forever.
wut
Ohhhhh mmyyyy gaaaaaaaaassshhhhh
Shit
haha
Oh... my... god...
Got me hooked man!!

What is this omg
https://www.openbible.info/topics/homosexuality\n\n\nhttps://www.openbible.info/topics/fornication\n\n\nActs 2:3838 Peter said to them, “Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. \n\n\nRomans 8:5-65 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace\n\nRomans 10:8-178 But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart”—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 9 [a]that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, [b]resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, [c]resulting in salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in Him will not be [d]disappointed.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 13 for “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”14 How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who [e]bring good news of good things!”16 However, they did not all heed the [f]good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word [g]of Christ.
WHOS DIGGIN THE FALL LOOK?! I cant wait to film more OMG!
please please please do so pigmented t-shirts!!!
SLAY!!!!
i loveeee ittt
Soooo beautiful!!
💜💜💜
I love this
Yesss I need more tutorials
Yaaaas queen more tutorials!!!
finally a makeup tutorial!!
Does anyone use the mario badescu rose water spray?? On the back of the bottle it says it can be used as a setting spray but every time I use it as a setting spray it makes my mascara smudge everywhere and I rlly want to get a setting spray but I'm not allowed to buy expensive ones so does anyone have any recommendations of cheap sprays that u can get in Australia???
Loving the look! I personally watch every video you post idc what it is u could just stare at the camera n id still watch 😍 lol can't wait to see more!!
More tutorials! I like them when you do them with a new palette to see how they blend out!
So beautiful 😍 I love tutorials. You should definitely do more. 💛💛💛
I prefer tutorials because I can't always get a new weird product that comes out. I live for a tutorial because I'm not good at makeup at all and my soul is just dying to get better. Lol
To be honest I’m super tired of reviews/try its/weird shit/everything else. I really truly began watching videos on YouTube to learn how to do my makeup better. And like...I started watching certain people and wouldn’t just stop watching them if I still semi liked what they were doing, but I miss talk through tutorials. I feel like nobody really does tutorials or hauls anymore which I also really liked. Idk that’s just me
love the turorial!!! digging the look so muchhh <3 p,s though love, 'OUD' is an arab word and is pronounced as 'ood' <3
I feel like if you do reviews with new products while creating looks you'll kill two birds with one stone 😘
Love your tut !! I learn so much \nAnd reviews are great but if I can't afford or get the products I don't get them so it's kinda not helpful to me sometimes
As someone who has mastered the makeup basics, I really appreciate tutorials and learning how to do different looks.
I love your tutorials! Straight up reviews just bore the hell out of me!
Red n Purple just go perfectly together <3
Loving the Fall look! I'm all about some Fall weather, so keep the Fall tutorials coming!🎃
Manny, please don't ever stop making tutorials for us! It's like having a little personal Manny Family time! Your videos/tutorials always cheer me up <3
I live for the tutorials!!!
More tutorials pleaseee! Too many reviews up in here....!!
🍂🍁🍂🍁🍂🍁🍂🍁🍁🍂🍁🍂 love this look I can't wait to recreate when I get it for my birthday! Honestly love ur reviews xx
I feel like YouTube is in such a review stage also because brands are releasing products left and right, there are new products all the time!
Hi manny! I like tutorials but I think if it's combined with like a q&a or chit chat get ready it makes it a lot more interesting!
Love tutorials, dont like that nobody is doing them!! Its great for beginners!!
Yes more tutorials please!! I don't like all the reviews, I want to get inspired!
Love how the entire time it was about views. Yet when you review something you jefree and Laura do it on the same two days.
Hilarious! I love the ending.
I do love tutorials! I think the reason why they might not get as many views is because most tutorials are not planned out. Like I know most ppl choose I few things they wanna use, but then they tell us their just gonna wing it and have no real plan for the tutorial or how it's gonna look. So it doesn't feel as though there is much effort put into it and I know a lot of ppl are petty and aren't gonna watch something to give someone money for just sitting down in front of the camera and doing whatever. It makes the person not feel as professional bc their pulling the makeup look our of their ass? I hope that make any sense! In contrast, reviews are well thought out and take time to come up with (unless it's a first impression) so it seems more professional and thought out.
I love tutorials!!!!! It's fun to see reviews and the weird makeup items on the market, but so few of us are likely to actually go out and buy those or be able to afford them that after a certain point I just get bored. But tutorials I can recreate with my own products, and it shows your true artistry and talent as a makeup artist first and foremost--which is why I watch you! xoxo!!
it's always cool to mix up videos but if you stop doing tutorials it's like you're turning away from what your youtube videos were supposed to be about in the first place. people want to learn from you and get inspired by you so if you're just on here for views so you can get a decent paycheck then that's just not cool
Manny you're such an awesome person and so true to yourself. I really admire your honesty with your reviews. Keep it up!
I love a good orange while sitting in front of an orange background.😂😄
I love the tutorials as well😍❤️
oh my gosh you so pretty with and without makeup i would say im jelouse but i dont wear makeup i have an effin baby face
Goddamn I need this palette nowwww~.  This look is STUNNING holy shit. Give us more tutorials, Manny. Loving it. Especially more grungy ones like this, I live for this stuff. <3
More tutorials!! & how tos! Teach me how to blend to the gods
Yes! I love your tutorials Manny!! I absolutely love you, Jeffrey, Laura, and Nikkie!! You guys are so amazing! Definite idols! I have bought a lot of your products! You guys made me feel so much better about playing with makeup and getting a dramatic look! Love you all! Do you and don’t let the haters bring you down!
views still at the hundred thousands after 5 days.
Gonna try and recreate this with my huda palette!! Probably won't look as good as yours though 😂😂
I like reviews on new stuff but I will never get over tutorials!!
I love tutorials. It’s so hard for me to think of what color combinations go good together and watching tutorials helps me realize what works and what doesn’t!
do a video with jaclyn hill!
I totally splurged and ordered this palette because of this video! 😍😍 keep doing tutorials I’m in love with the loooks you come up with! Especially with pops of color on the lid and bomb ass fall looks 😩😍👌🏼
I still love tutorials!! Jeffree's are so entertaining. I have watched most of them at least twice. I also like the grwm collabs. It's a new season! We need new color combo ideas!
I've been using Huda's palettes non-stop. I'm so obsessed with them .
You should totally do a crown eye makeup tutorial it will look super flawless on you 😍😍👑💗 you always do anyways 😍😍💖
This is my new fall look
I was thinking the same thing about the tutorial thing. Like I love the review videos but sometimes a girls wants to have a new makeup look lol.
Manny PLEASE don't stop doing tutorials, I live for watching them. Even if there the GRWM videos.\nThis is what the MUA on the end of your name means and I'd hate to miss out on your beautiful looks!!!!!
take a shot every time Manny says intense
Manny , u just like me I love hoodies
I love tutorials!!!! I would rather have this than a review
Ahhh obsessed with this look! Fall is my favorite season!!! Thank you for this!
YOU ARE FIRE 🔥

I love tutorials!😍 that’s what got me into your channel 😁
I personally love watching tutorials because you give me so many different ideas on looks, I prefer to see a tutorial over a review, but I'm just one person. I love you so much Manny Mua!
I love your look ! That lip looks fantastic . Also I think your totally right about there hardly being any tutorials out in the makeup world . There are mainly reviews now . I’ve seen literally almost no tutorials in YouTube recently .so kudos to you for seeing that and giving us one 😘
Lol “ooooo who is she though? Fuck” 😂😂\nI live for these videos!! Love love love!! ❤️❤️🍂🍁🍂🍁
I personally love when you do tutorials becuase i feel like its showing off your style especially when it's laid back and you just talk about life and your opinion I love you manny you inspired me to be me without an apology
No I love both!!!! And u always have the best look going on. Love how u describe it as u go. Tutorials & reviews help a lot. Cuz I don't know shit about makeup. So this helps a whole fuken lot!  😍😍😍 p.s. love Hocus pocus!!
I’m thinking about dressing up as red riding hood. Can you please do a make up look inspired by her? Thanks 💋
I love the lip!!!!!!!!
Please keep the Tutorials coming!!! I love the reviews. However, I LOOOOVE Tutorials even more!!!

I love tutorials! I NEEED tutorials, I'm such a fucking rookie, help me
Do a yellow or pink smokey eye tutorial please
WHY IS YOUTUBE NOT TELLING ME WHEN YOU POSSSSTTTT?!?!?! I legit have to keep up with your Snapchat and then search you up 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄👿
I love tutorials and product reviews. I am not the best at make Up and not too good at doing different eye looks with different colors. I mostly stick to gold and brown eyeshadow with a dark or nude lip. I like seeing how to use more bold colored eyeshadows and how to blend them out and which shades and looks work together
Tutorials!!!  Seen it was on the trending so there's your answer to the videos ppl want to see. Xoxo
Never tired of tutorials!!!!!! Trends are always changing...ways of doing things always changing! Keep them coming!
Love you Manny!!! Always so beautiful!!!!! ❤️💋❤️
I miss seeing tutorials so much, please do more ! Such a stunning look :)
I love this look ! You make it look so easy and effortless... But when I try it is a epic fail. I just want to say you, lauraLee and JefferySt⭐️r have helped me through so much that has happened in my life. Your make up tutorials are what has influenced me to try new looks. When I apply make up it is inspirational and make me feel less insecure about myself. \nI love you 💕 Keep it up 💅🏻You look flawless 🔥
Jess looks just as beautiful in her natural state without the make up..!!
I'm in love with her accent <3
Do you always do a little verse at the end bc I Love it😍
Why did she move 12 houses in 19 years? I really would like her or someone to answer this.

You & Gabe should do a video where you put a camera on Milo and just see what he does when y’all are gone lol
Also, I really want to get eyelash extensions but am so nervous. I would love to see a video on you getting them and talking about your experience with them, pricing, care, etc!
I love Jess so much she's such a sweet, caring and loving person and I'm so happy that you have reached so many subscribers cause you deserve it❤️
Hi Jess! I was wondering if you use toner at all or if you've tried it? My skin used to be very dry, sometimes even after moisturiser, but I heard about this Korean trend where you apply toner on till it doesn't immediately get absorbed into the skin. I worry that's a bit too much so I don't put as much, usually around 3 applies. But I find that my skin dries out a little less! Just wanted to know your thoughts on it?
You are so awesome, nice and beautiful even without makeup.  You always give a great advices. So ty, lysm😘😍❤️❤️❤️
Does a video on “what to wear for prom &makeup for prom”!!!!! ❤️❤️
Sorry if this is mean but I always mistaken you and Sierra Furtado
Loveeee this and you!! ❤️❤️❤️
You are so genuine and kind!!! I love you and Gabe, you both are an inspiration!!\nI would love to see a video about your faith and what you think. Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️

Jess we have the same shirt! Is it the cropped bubble sleeve top from Urban? If it is, i have the same one, super awesome!
Biggest skincare tip (if you could call it that) I ever received: drink LOTS of water. I don't one exactly what drinking lots of water does, I'm not a dermatologist, but ever since I upped my water intake, I've noticed my skin was clearing up (I have oily-normal skin).\nSo yeah; lots of water.
Any video you make i like to watch, but maybe fall videos??😊💕

If anybody is looking for an organic, cruelty free, and totally AMAZING moisturizer for a decent price, definitely check out Green Screen by FARMACY. You can get it at Sephora! It has SPF 30 and it makes my skin feel so nice and I have sensitive skin too! :)

Please do about your faith Jess!! 💛
Hey Jess! Do you wear daily sunscreen? If so, what kind do you use? I want to start wearing sunscreen everyday but I have very sensitive skin and it often makes me break out. Love the video!

HER EYES OMG
OMG! My mom sells rodan+fields!
YouTube have demonetised this video (boo!) but you can still support me by buying me a coffee! https://ko-fi.com/A1814A5T
It's actually really helpful that you speak so clearly! I'm autistic and have APD (auditory processing disorder) and while I technically have perfect hearing, my brain does not know how to translate sounds correctly.\nSo I have a lot of trouble understanding spoken language, but I can understand you almost perfectly fine, which is very rare for me. You're great!
I´d wish that all english native speakers would pronounce *that* clearly ;-) being a german viewer of your channel I can honestly say it´s a real pleasure to listen to you <3
Boo for demonetization! I know I sound very deaf, and my voice is very low so even on my good days people have a hard time understanding me. So I simply don't bother! Maybe it could be fun for you two to take a class together to learn sign? I mean, I know you already know most of the signs but it might help Claudia learn better ;P
Fascinating!!! I didn't realise there were TWO British sign languages! 😲😅 Loved learning about the structural differences behind both though. I guess there are so many sign languages because they develop as organically as any other language does. Although after a quick Google search; we currently have 6909 languages in the world...so maybe 300 isn't too bad! 😂\n\nFor teaching Claudia, I think using sign language as much as you can when speaking to her would be helpful. I noticed that for me (even though I can't sign) through sheer repetitiveness from watching the TV show Switched at Birth (which I mentioned in one of your previous videos), I found myself picking up the signs and associating them with their correct words automatically (ASL though 😜). \nOn Claudia's end, she should first try signing a few words here and there in her sentences as opposed to trying to get her whole sentence signed correctly right off the bat (which will just lead to a lot of frustration). Think words like: bathroom, kettle etc. and eventually she will pick up more associative words and go from speaking like a child to an eloquent adult in no time. \nPersonally, I'm bilingual (English and French) and I understand but I'm too embarrassed to speak (Spanish and Italian) because I'm still at that speaking like a child stage, but practice makes perfect! 💪😤
I'm learning so much!! Thank you for explaining all of this. This is the first video of yours I've seen and I really enjoyed it! You're so so charming and entertaining.
I love all your videos!!
Hi Jessica! About what percentage of a spoken conversation can you pick up correctly from lip-reading alone?  And is it far more straining than having a conversation in sign?
Personally I believe the best part of all these videos is the lightheartedness of the presentation (most of them at least). Lovely Jessica seems to always be on the verge of cracking up and it's enjoyable to hear whatever she has to say. She makes me want to learn sign language.
I learned a lot from this actually! Thank you so much for posting. And just so you know, your voice is very very beautiful.
Hi Jess, in a way your similar to my mum, in that she spoke for a long time before she lost her hearing in her 30's. It must be hard word to practise and I never really thought about it that way. I've just started making cooking videos with my own hand written captions, I try to film so I'm not blocking what I'm doing with the captions. If you have a moment would you have a look please and let me know what you think and how I could improve my videos for the community?
You're such an amazing and empowered woman, I love to watch you shine! Also I loved these videos on deafness, they were very honest and informative. Here where I live the sign language has a structure similar to BSL, so it was pretty interesting learning about SSE, I didn't know it existed.
Can you make Claudia a series of videos kiss for her to learn from?
I loved all your videos this week! I’m actually hard of hearing and my dad is going deaf due to his cancer..so this week I’m starting ASL classes, I know some ASL but like you I use SSE because I honestly just find the syntax of ASL to be confusing. For example, you mentioned in BSL you would say “name you what?” In ASL it would be “you name what?” Granted, I do speak french but I’m already used to English sentence structure so it just is easier for me.
I didn't know the difference between BSL and SSE, thanks for that! I'm trying to learn sign language at the moment but if I try to watch a video with vocab I feel myself switching off. Something Special (the CBeebies show) taught me a bit as a teenager and I like watching interpretations of songs so I've loaded up your playlist of signed songs to get me started!
Your such an inspiration
You have a beautiful accent. It matches your clothes. (I don't know what that means). But it does.
Haha a teach Claudia SL video is in order
do a video teaching Claudia SSE!!
While in Las Vegas Nevada recently I noticed that most shows (burlesque and variety) now offer a sign language interpreter. All you need do is let them know 4 hours (minimum and 24 is best) before the show you are going to see. Also great video!
Love learning about all this!\nOur (America) sign language is ASL (American Sign Language, lol). I know the alphabet and a few words, but not many. I have no idea how to structure sentences...\n\nSSE makes some more sense to me. Like, if I'm trying to use ASL, I do tend to just put the sentence in the same order I speak it. SSE seems like it'd be nice and straight forward that way.\nDo you know if America uses SSE at all or if they have an equivalent?\n\nAlso, I read (a while back) that the reason there are so many different sign languages is because it was 'illegal' to teach any sort of signing languagr to deaf people. (Not sure if actually illegal, or just frowned on by society.) So little groups of deaf people would create ways to communicate with each other, organically. Then, when actual deaf communities (schools, etc) started popping up, they started becoming actual languages as more and more people would be communicating and they needed to do more than sign one word at a time. It was interesting to read about, and I wish I could remember all the details.
Your voice is amazing. I have trouble sleeping and when I'm really stressed and just need a sleep, I put your videos in the background and your voice 'soothes' me and lulls me to sleep. I throughly believe you should do audio books. Except maybe not the ones with the Irish accent......... Xxxxxx Xxxxxxxxx
One of the fun ways I learnt sign in my Auslan classes was with certain games. Like I can remember at one point there was a lockdown and we had to hide against a wall of the classroom and not speak, but being a sign language class, we could all kind of communicate with one another, so we played I Spy in Auslan. So that might be a fun way to get her to learn colours perhaps?
When I first started watching your videos I got hella confused because I'd be watching you sign and understand it and then you'd use a sign thats different to what we use in New Zealand and I was like why is it so similar??? because it was just similar enough for me to be I know whats going on and get complacent. It turns out British, New Zealand and Australian signs are considered part of the same dialect because they were created together and influenced each other, yay Commonwealth countries.
I'm learning through song! Music creates memories different parts of the brain, more long term so it's great for learning and revising. Look up Wayne Barrow - he's trying to get bsl taught in schools so to raise awareness he SSE signs music and songs and goes through some of them slowly so you can learn along with the Lizzy Jay who is there with him and only knows the basics
In fact, your English is so clear that is very easy to understand for someone like me who is trying to learn English, me and my family use your videos to practice listening :)
Hi Jessica, love your videos! You are quite possibly the most adorable person on YouTube 😊 x
I know American Sign Language and it's sooooo different from BSL! Watching you sign your version of SSE is so interesting to me because some signs are similar and then others are just like ???????  Haha!
Honestly your Irish accent wasn't half bad
Interesting. I’ve always thought and been told that it’s ‘your name what’ in BSL, as opposed to ‘name you what’. Either way, sign language grammar is certainly weird/interesting!
I wouldn't say slurred, it's more that the sound of consonants is muted/lost. My best friend in high school was deaf and her explanation was that if you can't see a sound being made and you can't hear you have no way to know, for example, if it's a P or a B (or What the difference between those is), or how sharp something is 'meant' to sound. She was brought up in a mainstream school despite being almost completely deaf after the age of 8 and they refused to teach her BSL. Why we don't teach sign language instead of 7 years of French and Spanish is beyond me.
I was told I was HOH as a child, haven't had it checked since but I know I struggle with hearing and understanding. I had NO IDEA International Week of the Deaf was a thing!!!
I’m a hearie from America but I’m self learning ASL signs and use it as SSE here. I learn by watching people sign songs and it helps me learn signs. That way if I can’t remember a specific word I might remember the “song lyric sentence” and it helps me recall. Always a pleasure to watch your videos. Much love
This video explained so much! I first found your videos because (as a hearing person who doesn't know how to sign but is interested in the topic) I wanted to see how BSL was different from ASL, and I thought, Oh, here's a British YouTuber who sometimes signs—this'll show me! And I was kind of confused for a while by the syntax, sentence structure, etc., because they seemed very much like spoken English. So your explanation about the difference between BSL and SSE made a lightbulb go off above my head. Thank you for explaining the difference so clearly!\n\nI love your videos and wanted to also thank you for raising awareness for the International Week of the Deaf. I didn't even know that it was happening until I saw you mention it (almost a week ago now), but because you alerted me to it I've been telling other people about it—both on Twitter and such but also in the real world—to raise awareness. So thank you for raising awareness, which then inspires other people to raise awareness ... in a lovely ripple effect.
Thanks for the explanation about SSE and BSL, I've been learning BSL for a while now, but had no clue about SSE and was constantly confused about how you speak and sign at the same time even though the structure in BSL is sooo different, but now I know you use SSE. It's cool they use same signs though, so you can talk to people using either and understand each other (the sentence structure doesn't really bother me as I already speak 3 other languages and the structure is different in every one of them haha). love your videos, x
Hiya, thank you for making these videos, they've been incredibly informative and enjoyable to watch.\n\nI'm in the process of learning BSL myself and personally I think it's easier to learn if you can make it fun somehow and turn the learning into games. Categories help too, I find it harder to retain signs if they're random and have no connection.\n\nAnd also, as much as I hate to admit it, being persistent. Can Claudia read fingerspelling well? Perhaps use signs here and there daily and if she cannot  remember the sign, perhaps fingerspell it instead? Hope all goes well, I wish you both the best of luck and if I think of any more ideas, I'll share them :)
You are the most interesting, engaging and informative person, i can't stop watching your videos. Sorry that youtube is being an asshole.
I relate so much to this. Since I am losing my hearing I struggle with the BSL sentence structure and feel more comfortable using SSE. Another wonderful video Jessica :)
Wow, it's really interesting that BSL has a different grammar for signing. I didn't realise how different sign languages could be. Also, eyebrows on point!
Maybe Claudia should try taking a class? That way she'd be with other beginners (so it's less pressure to learn without mistakes - I know The Fear and that's a good way to get over it) and she could surprise you one day with being able to sign to you! (: \n\n(I'd also maybe like a video where you teach her a few signs, or a sentence? That would be really cool, I think.)
Super interesting as always 🌼 That's the Irish accent of a leprechaun ... begorra so it tis like ... but you did it perfectly💚 If you ever get talking to a leprechaun don't forget to catch hold of him cos you know what happens then right ... 🌈
I so greatly appreciate that you caption your videos! I am hearing, but because of EDS am slowly losing my hearing. Having captions is so, so, helpful!!!
Watched this with my younger sister who’s never seen any of your videos and her first comment about five seconds into the video was how see thinks you look like one of those classic pop art girls and honestly, I kind of see it. Thanks for great video :)
I was struggling with learning how BSL structure works, but you've put it so simply - thank you!
You could make you teaching claudia sign language into a video :)
Dose she use BSL
Floof doin a growl
Love u.. \n😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘
If you are going to teach Claudia sign language. I think You should first figure out if she is a verbal or visual learner, or she may be both. So Than get books or videos to help teach her.
Yay a makaton mention :)\nI use a mix between Makaton and BSL/SSE because I learnt some BSL but my coordination makes it very difficult to be precise and my hands can run away with things and start their own signs so I prefer the freedom of Makaton but I try to add BSL signs to my vocabulary where I can. I'd love to learn the grammar but there seem to be so few british signers on youtube.
Can SSE work with ASL signs too? If anyone knows
You opening that card.... Oh, Carrie!! We miss you!! Xxx
Can you get it in? It's not really in is it? Looks like a turtle head - sounds like the time I lost my virginity.
We saw you on the first night at the Hippodrome. We even saw the cake being delivered 😂 You’re awesome Carrie. A new fan here! Hugs! x
Saw you Saturday night in Bristol hippodrome, you were amazing!! Thank you so much for such a good night, it was my first musical! (many more coming up this year😁) x
So nostalgic for Bristol now!! I haven't been back since I lived there for a year for university. My flat was just up Park Street from the Hippodrome! 😍
i live in the us so i can’t see this production (which kills me bc i’m like in love with this cast and also you), but my fingers are crossed for a cast recording or (if the world is feeling generous) a proshot of some sort?? for now i’ll settle for binge-watching interviews and promo videos but like. you’re perfect. not even kidding.
Returning to a place you performed in the past and that you have fond memories of is quite emotional and amazing!  So happy you're having such a great time on tour :D. Plus RIP Archie... ancestor material for sure!
It wasn't until I saw Carrie in the beginning of this video that I realized just how much her hair has grown out :)\n\nUpdate: just watched the end of the video with the mouse. Carrie, you are so precious.
Saw the show last night in Bristol, you were incredible!!
I'm a homing pigeon
The show was amazing well worth waiting for
Just binge watched all the watch me wednesdays again, one of the best series on YouTube 💜
Where is Les? Fab job Scott!
Watched The Addams Family today at the Hippodrome and it was flipping brilliant! I was in awe at how amazing the whole cast was, even when there were some disturbances the cast stayed in characters. I'd love to watch it again!!
You are so amazing and an absolute credit to yourself and a fantastic actress that can do anything you put your mind to x
Why did you put the box on its lid? Did you remember to put holes in it so the mouse can breathe?
Aaw your hair has gotten so long Carrie omg!! And I was emotional during this, when you opened that card and when you were on your old dressing room. Rip Archie❤️❤️
I'm seeing you today!!!!
You'r so caring for  looking after a mouse, must people would just leave him to die & you have such an outstanding voice! Did u train at a theatre school?🎭
Carrie, could you make a video doing your favorite vocal warm ups? It'd be help a lot of singers I think, plus it'd be fun and interesting to watch, thanks :)
Anyone know if there's anywhere you can buy the soundtrack for The Addams Family? Saw the show in July and loved and would love the album.
In way too emotional about Archie
The length of you hair is so cute right now!!
Carrie! Your hair in the beginning was soooo cute!
Hi, Carrie Hope Fletcher. I want to see a photos of you in Mary Poppins.
OMG im so lucky, i got to meet you and Oliver today. I was the girl who was really emotional and couldn't stop crying, please apologise to oliver for me. All the cast were amazing today. thank you sooo much xxxx
I saw that Mary Poppins all those years ago! I was right up in the gods and could see the terror on the face of the flying Mary...
Tbh I'm quite impressed that it has been fourteen years and you still remember everyone's names! :D guess I just have a very short memory...
Hi Carrie! My name is Jemma and I just wanted to say how amazing you are. You are such a beautiful person and deserve so much as you are so kind and caring and just the best person. You are an amazing singer and actor and I hope you have an amazing life and career. Unfortunately I live in Australia and I won't be able to see The Addams Family live but it is my absolute dream and I hope that maybe one day I will be able to see you and Oliver perform in The Addams family as well as the rest of the cast. Once again you are beautiful and I love you so much.\n\nMuch Love,\nJemma from Australia!❤️\n(You probably won't see this but I just thought I'd say something nice anyway 😊)
I always love the warm up and behind the stage parts! \nGreat vlog again, looking forward to the next one :) !!
I would love to see a video on your singing warm ups! I take a little children's choir and am looking for some genuine warm ups! They would love it if they were doing the same warm ups as you guys in theatre!! \nLove your videos, love seeing the behind scenes of something I've always dreamed of doing x
Where did you get your amazing jeans???
Oh my goodness to have a signed photo of you as Eponine?!?! I'd probably faint or cry from happiness. Probably both. <3
I'm glad you are feeling better! Hope Archie survives! I'm gutted I couldn't see you perform in Bristol. But hopefully coming to see you perform in Wolverhampton - can't wait! Xx
Would be so grateful to anyone reading this if they would check my latest video, It's my first one ever which is scary. But karma will repay you good if you help a girl out :) like and sub if you would hehe ❤️❤️❤️ all you have to do is click :)))
Just got back from seeing you tonight! I love love loooooved the show❤️.  You are so amazing Carrie :)
Actually ignore the last comment cos I went to see it on Thursday and it was absolutely amazing. It's honestly one of the best nights of my life. Got to see Oliver at stage door though I'm gutted I couldn't see you. But your performance made it worth it. 💜💜💜💜
nice, you went past my house
Ah! I lived in Briz for 3 years, so cliché to say but fun to see you at the Hip and around thems local parts! If you get a chance to get up Cabot Tower in the centre, any of the Boston Tea Party coffee shops AND BAKESMITHS MY DAYS. Also the Cotham Hill (said cott-ham or coth-ham?!) charity shops are BRILLO PADS for lil' gems. If you get any down time, a poke around Clifton, cobbles, coffee shops and cute things to see comes warmly reckoed (as does the fish and chips in Clifton!) Enjoy Bristol, I hope you get some quality rest <3
I think boyonce is the perfect nickname for Scott! 😂 xx
Laughing at the crew girls checking out Oli dancing HAHA
Bristol is my country lol
Carrie, I'm thrilled your in Bristol but so heart broken because I can't see you because I'm away. Is there anyway I could deliver a letter to you? I love you so much xxxxxxxx
Coming to see you on Saturday 😊😍😘
Is Scott playing Fester permanently? Did Les leave?
Please! Could you do a tutoriel on how you do your two braids with the cute scarf in it? You look too adorable !!
RIP Archie, hey! Maybe he could have played thing!
Carrie is a woman of many hairstyles and I love it. Working the pigtails.
Awww Archie! :(\nGlad you're feeling better, Carrie! I don't remember the last time you wore jeans but those ones look amazing!!!
Love watching behind the scenes of theatre!!!! It's Totally my dream job❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

So sad that when I lived in Bristol, the Addams family was on in Cardiff and now I've moved there for uni its in Bristol this week :(
I lived in Bristol for 3 years when I was at uni. I loved it there. It's so quirky and like a mini London.
Wow Carrie, your hair is growing so fast!
I love that you give your coworkers free reign of the camera sometimes! It's super funny, and also fun to see you in action!
any small youtubers wanting to help each other out? ill sub back x
OH MY GOD YOU ARE IN MY HOME CITY! I'm coming to see the show on Friday and I cant wait!
Carrie your backpack is lovely!! so pretty!! xx
Your voice is stunning.  I used to live in Bristol miss it so much x
Coming to see this saturday! So excited as I saw you in les mis and also played Wednesday a few years back in our groups production! My friends went yesterday said it was amazing and took photos with you at stage door! 🎉
My mum and I went to see the matinee in Bristol yesterday! It was the first musical I'd ever been to and we thought you were all amazing :) Such a fun show!
Poor Archie. :(. So is les Dennis still ill, he wasn't well when I saw you last week in Manchester. Also I think there must have been something going around that theatre, I got ill last week too. X
Aw the card from your mom and dad<3 Dressing room nostalgia :') RIP Archie!
I noticed before you mentioned the Cat Cafe that you were going to walk passed it and you gave the exact reaction I thought you would lol, love cat cafes.
Carrie, would you ever be able to do an updated hair care routine? Your hair is looking so long and lovely
I like Oliver's haircut. If I wasn't going bald, I'd get it myself.
How did this get on trending 4 with 45k views
I'm coming to see the show on Saturday evening, so excited!
Omg I LOVE your bag! Where is it from!? X
It was great seeing the show yesterday!
Do you think you're gonna venture into the cat café at some point? Love the video! x
Omg I came to watch you when the show came to my city and now my school announced today that we are doing the Addams family as our school musical this year! I'm so happy!
We were at the Saturday show. So sad not to see you proform. You did the right thing though and we enjoyed the show all the same. Hopefully we can come see you in something else soon xxx
your hair looks so good at this length :)
When I saw 'Hippo' in the title, my brain immediately went, Hippo Campus! (the band) and thought Carrie was gonna talk about seeing them live or something... guess I've been watching too many Hippo Campus vids...
My home town of Bristol!!!
As a Bristolian I properly yelped in delight at seeing you in our lovely city! I hope it’s treating you all well 😊
Dat ass Ms Fletcher 👀😂 someone hasn't been slacking on their squatting 💪😜
i'm seeing addams family on 5th october!!! in belfast!! missing school and all, i'm so excited
Pause at 7:58 to see three ladies checking out Oliver!
Oliver dancing and those 3 women staring at him like wtf is honestly hilarious!
ahhh i miss england so much watching your vlogs carrie but they really help me feel closer to home! <3 i wish i could come and watch the musical but unfortunately i'm a poor british uni student living in australia! i've had one normal night on loop since i first listened to it this morning and im in awe of the notes and lyrics <3
Hearing you sing made me happy💜 glad your feeling better.xx.
Archie! :(
Archie was so cute :'(
My city ❤️
rip archie addams x
Big up Bristol!
Carrie in jeans?
hmm
R.I.P Archie
RIP Archie we hardly knew ye
rip archie :(
**glasses nose twitch**
🖤💜🖤
Now this will sound really creepy but you actually have been to Bristol in 2012. I only know that because I watched one of your old videos called 'Life Update' the other day where you talked about being in Bristol for deal or no deal. :D
Guys I know this has nothing todo do with the channel but there was an earthquake in México City yesterday and theres a lot of help needed if you could spreed the word would help a lot
Nice comparison!
swol af
the thing is, america as a whole isn't as fat as statistics show. the south drags down the rest of the US along with it, with mississippi on its own having an average BMI of over 35. sadly, i believe that's due to the fact that the southern states are also the poorest in the nation. the further west and the further north you go, the thinner americans get. i'm from colorado, the thinnest state in the US, and the average BMI here is ~20-21.
I was so into Rachels business sexy look ...lol Jun you be a lucky dude ...lol seriously   I loved the vid I will see you next time
When Jun said the cup sizes were to small my mind went dirty. R.I.P 😂
Love Rachel's hairstyle on the thumbnail, thought it was someone else for a sec😆
When I lived in southern China, I ate fried food everyday and I lost weight! I never ate bread or dairy. Cheese did not exist. Most of the fried foods were vegetables with egg or meat. The bowls of rice were small. I think that the American diet makes us fat.
Hey just saying I don't know if the whole world follows the FDA but in America the FDA allows companies to be %20 off about the calorie count so something that says 100 calories could legally be 120.
I'm a 102 lb Asian\nGuess how old I am
You guys, this was AWESOME! AWESOME idea Rachel, AWESOME self promoting skills at the end there Jun... xD lol (sooo smooth xD)\nHaven't seen a video of you guys in AGES, and SO SO SO SO GLAD you cameback! =D\n\nHope to see A LOT MORE videos from you in the near future! ;)\nGood luck with it, and keep up the QUALITY (over quantity) WORK!
almost spit my food out when i saw swole af
Swole af
lol u guys r cute
Swoll af 😂
wow american drink sizes are huge! :o
i missed you T_T
GOLD.
:D
Swole af
*_swole af_*
guys are so cute
Asians have crazy metabolism. For example, my caucasian friends see me eating junk food all the time and they are always like dude ur gonna get fat. I have vegan friends who exercise who are fatter than me.
Im fat in japan lol i hate school becuase i dont know what are they saying like what
you guys are awesome. I really love your videos
Is it racist that when Jun was talking with the cat in front of him there was going to be a obligatory Asian joke?
Nice video :) I visited Japan for the 1st time last September 02 for 1 week. Your videos helped me prepare myself for the possible culture shock that I might experience.\n\nDuring our stay, one thing I noticed while eating in a restaurant is that most of the Japanese don't drink water that much. I felt shy every time I need to ask for a water refill... But I like drinking a lot of water... So what I did was I just bought my own water bottle every time we eat out. I put it in my bag, so I won't be asking that much for a water refill...
This video it was just mind blowing in the differences between what we eat and Japan eats. Though I feel like if I go to Japan I would starve.
I'm fat... Rachel is pretty... Buy jewelery lol
So this is where the McDonald's large fry boxes are, they're in Japan while we still have the Super Size fry boxes in America.
my bmi is 23.1 probably cuz i'm tall
there's a lot of akb48 picture references in this video, are you an akb48 fan jun? hahaha
My bmi is 12 T H I N A F
I don't eat fast food, soda, alcohol, or candy and I'm proud to say I've never eaten at McDonald's before but I'm not completely guilt free since I do enjoy going to restaurants in my town once every couple of months
WAIT. Why would you show a character called Scottish Bastard played by a Canadian actor as your example for American obesity... LOL
Funny, I am just having some KFC over here in Indonesia 😂
How much calories are in the jewelry collection?
so basically Japan's fast food soda sizes are the same as the US... from the 1980's
just dont eat! ever! no food! youll be so attractive!
I went to Japan a few weeks ago. Just out of plain curiosity I ordered McDonald's. Yes! They have smaller portions. However, for me it was the perfect portion. I felt satisfied when I finished my meal. Usually, here in United States I tend not to finish my meal. Because it is to much for me.
I was about to subscribe... When I realized that i have already subscribed
OMG THAT NECKLACE WAS SO PRETTY 💕💕💕💕💕💕😍😍😍😍😍😍 I MUST HAVE
I think Rachel is very well ya know not as pretty as Japanese girls
THIS IS RACHEL AND JUN. WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT ALL THE WAY made me lose it ;; you guys are the best!
Hey Rachel! I am from Nepal but I am at USA for my study. I wanted to go to japan for visit purpose. How can I apply to Japan from USA as a Nepalese citizen.
Jun go upload video on junskitchen
best add ever
japanese leg size look the same as hand
Rachel you should really get some anti-reflective lenses the next time you buy glasses.
check the sugar content, sugar is what makes you fat
I'm from New Zealand and from this chart we are 1 above japan in the average calorie intake yet we are the 3rd most overweight country in the world, I'm so confused right now.
An answer for the calories of the fries might be in what oil is used? McDonalds in the US I know switched to vegetable oil many years ago for their fries. Not sure on BK.
Not overly worried about calorie levels as we're not big eaters anyway but Le Hubby & I watch our sodium levels. We are always shocked when we look at the sodium levels in some Japanese fast food. Misu, oshoyu, etc are very tasty but super-high in sodium!
They're both so beautiful! If they have a child it will be GORGEOUS! Oh my goodness.
American fast food in Japan vs American fast food in America
The skits for this video were so cute
Very interesting, cultural differences are fascinating.  I love Jun’s Kitchen, and your jewelry collection.  One of the best facets of your videos is your normalcy.  Best wishes to you.
it's always please my day by watching videos of both of you. thank you.
Good thing I don't drink soda lmao
This video was great good job.
Yes and they are unhealthy extremes! Jun looks too thin. Stop trying to promote anorexia. You are starving your girlfriend.
Great video guys and just like Jun said.. eating fresh home made real food is the way to go. I haven't stepped foot inside a fast food restaurant in over 10 years, the food is just so unappealing in every way.
hi rachel and jun..have you tried the game ''cat mario''??
I'm so happy to see this guys back. Cuties <3
you need to update your cooking channel more frequently then!!!
I'm like Rachel, have to drink lots of water all day. It's good for you and actually helps with digestion, but a lot of people in the states tend to replace water with soda or other sugary drinks which ends up making things so much worse, even if you're only eating at home. It is interesting that drinks are so much smaller in Asian countries, I wonder if there's something about the evolution of the Asian diet that has led to a lower needed hydration level... I would say lower salt levels but there's plenty of salt in most Asian cuisine.
American’s are fat fucks
i work in korean public schools and the water habit seems to be what throws people the most when first coming here. No one drinks with their meal in the cafeteria, they just take essentially a shot of water afterwards on the way our the door. Koreans teachers always joke about how foreign teachers are always walking around with giant bottles of water lol.
Do people put as much ice in their drinks as in the US though? We might have huge cups, but often times half or more of it just ice.
there is almost a year that i don't go to McDonalds
Do those small Japanese cups at least come with free refills (if only for water)?  The volume of water consumed with a meal should be equal to or exceed the volume of food eaten.
0H M4h G4WD heck I have the same ruler as you guys
This video is so impressive, educational and food for thought.
Japan is healthier and Japanese live longer than Americans.
Rachel you stand out in the crowd sooo much 😂
Also lets not forget they jam pack the cups with ice
Thats was one of the most adorable transitions to an ad ive ever seen. I love them both 😂😂
something something but what about the amount of ice in the cups? usually american drinks are like 90% ice
Jun pls, you haven't made many cooking videos to tell other that they should try your food. but no hate
WHY AM I SO BROKE?! your jewelerylooks amazing Rachel!!
I drink a LOT of water
3 MONTHS WITHOUT A VIDEO
I eat junk food a lot, but I eat it at the smallest portion (like getting the kids meal) and that's how I stay skinny.
Japan is a dieter's nutritional heaven. America doesn't have to be bad either, but most of their food companies suck.
I don't know never really like fast food lol and US food just does not do it for me hlah to much junk even in the so called healthy food..also does not help they add in a LOT of stuff that's not even food such as petroleum byproduct and more NO TY! >_<'  but I've really liked Japanese fast food lol they at least offer healthy options with no junk on them or in to make the food cheaper just good food yay. ^_^\nAs always I don't replay to anyone sorry and trolls ja u win good for u lol! :P
I thought in the end he was going to say The best diet is to eat cats. with the cat in front of him lol.
no waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I thought people in countries like Japan and Taiwan would eat out WAY MORE than people in countries like USA or Canada D:
I want a mcdonalds now but i live so far away...
Despite of size, personally I prefer to cook my meals because I control what goes in it. Not to mention that I hate feeling bad after having all of that greasy food. Because I don't eat fast food a lot. Fast food to me is a meal made in less than 30min. Plus I save more money because I usually make enough food for a few days. Jun, do you have meals in Japan that are good as leftovers? I know that it's different there because most meals are best served fresh. However are there tricks to meal prep so when the day comes to make the meal you want ends up being as flavorful if not more than if you'd made the whole meal on the same day?
The Jewellery is so gorgeous. What a shame that I am allergic to silver :(
Coming from Denmark where people are constantly talking about exercising and eating healthy. This is how Denmark stands:\nMcDonalds\nHamburger - 253 kcal \nBig mac - 503 kcal\nCoca cola big - 212 kcal\nCoca cola medium - 170 kcal\nCoca cola small - 106 kcal\nFries big - 434 kcal\nFries medium - 330 kcal\nFried small - 231 kcal\n\nBruger King\nHamburger - 244.1 kcal\nWhopper - 613.6 kcal\nDouble Whopper - 851.7 kcal\nCoca cola big - 210 kcal\nCoca cola medium - 168 kcal\nCoca cola small - 105 kcal\nFries big - 347.9 kcal\nFries medium - 284.2 kcal\nFries small - 181.3 kcal\n\nTo sum it all up: If you want to eat the healthiest burgers and fries go to Denmark, for the healthiest soda go to Japan. Side note: most people in Denmark drink diet soda anyway. When deciding between Mcdonalds or Burger King, Burger King is healthier.
Greece is 3RD?!?!?!? WOWWWWWWWWWWW. I mean we do eat a whole lot and we add olive oil to ALL our foods Cuz tradition but at least what we eat is healthy😂 plus we don't eat out much, most often you can eat is once a week but our fast food portions are relatively small. Idk I'm surprised Cuz I don't see overweight Greeks often. That could just be me though😂
With the drinks the clear difference is the American drink is at least 50% ice at minimum.
I'm hungry now -_-
How could you drink NOTHING with a meal? I would absolutely choke and die, omg.
Omg love the video 😍 I like the new style  of this video too 😍😍.. keep the good work guys .. can't wait to see your next video 😊
You guys are such dorks XD I missed your videos! Also the food is a lot different between the two countries too! We tend to eat a lot of red meat and bread here whereas in Japan it's more of fish and rice. Tofu is like a thing only health nuts eat in America lol at least where I live! Most stores only have a small selection of it if any at all.
the effort that went into this video is amazing
I got a little scared when he started talking about his cooking channel while the cat was lying on the bench 😂
Who is that gorgeous celebrity who is apparently fat and ugly in Japan?
this guy is so full of shit
The guy is riddled with insecurities
attention whore alert
Comes off like a bit of a bullshit artist
Guy seems like a total arsehole and all his money is from his dad who's nothing more than a white collar criminal
I wouldn't be superseded if half his story's are made up.
This guy is dumb as fuck
Some guys have lost 12 million \nThere are people who have lost wayyyyy more....
Dan is a fucking idiot who is famous because all his money he had that from his dad lmfao.
Douche
Stories just as real as his big legs\nLUL
This guy is the definition of a meat head.  What a fucking idiot.
I don't care that he's rich, I hate the way he shows it off and how he spends it so recklessly
And then there's people like Phil Ivey who wins 16 million and has it taken away due to flaws by the casino itself
Obnoxious cunt
This guy looks like a Mongolian fox check it out google it
Not mad at this guy for being wealthy, but damn he's such a douche.
Time to buy a razor and maybe a new shirt.
Fuck the interviewer .when you call someone at a show, don’t point your walmart shoes towards them . Fucking disgusting personality!!!
his parents were rich asf lol he aint never work for anything
at least he can fuck your wife better then you
This guy is super full of himself , every time I see this guy i say he can't get worse...im wrong
Bilzerian's the man
Would love to hear from these people that he actually paid of losing bets. His face turns red the more he talks. I lost 6 million on a coin flip but sweating a guy trying to row across the Atlantic and break a world record gtfo. Ask any poker pros before 2014 nobody knew who you were or ever seen you in Vegas. The guy has $0 tournament winnings. Buys into cash games takes a couple of pics and leaves after a hour of walking around
and so? you want a medal?
THIS GUY IS SUCH A TOOL. SWEATING 30 DAYS BECAUSE OF 500.000 DOLLARS, THAT TELLS ALL ABOUT THIS RICH KID. JUST WAIT AND SEE WHEN NEXT YEAR HE IS GIVING INTERVIEW HOW HE LOST ALL HIS MONEY IN GAMBLING!
It's important to consider all of the facts before finalizing a decision.
What a funny guy haha, wish i lived his life
Allen Iverson!!!!!
Damn bro... Come on man
This guy will eventually die because of his careless life style. That or he will go broke
he is sweating a 500k bet in 30 days? LOL And he is a considered a bad ass? LOL \n\nI will say this because these are the industries I'm involved in and know the money. \nA trucking company owner who owns 20 trucks with 20 full time drivers can make that in a month. Before expenses. After its close to 200k in pocket. A MONTH ! EVERY MONTH! \nDO the math. \nThen the car business. A used car lot with a 200 used car inventory that turns over 75 cars a month will make 500k before wages to employees. Thats profit off sale of the car and profit off of sales of the finance contract and warranty profits and trade in profits. \nGranted those are top guys in their fields but its very doable. \nThe guys who own new car franchise dealers make more. WAY more. Off the sales, shops and parts and if they have a body shop its even more.....\nSome trucking outfits have 50-200 drivers and those are guys I rub elbows with. I seen their contracts and seen their rates. So I speak about facts. Same for the car lots. I seen the books on those deals. \nThe big outfits who have 500-1000 trucks running are making more money then this fool can spend. LOL \nHe is a for show people.......Smoke and mirrors.
Piece of garbage, he could pay me less to fight a pack of hyenas and he'd get his F'n money's worth while drinking whatever overpriced swill he drinks.\n\n\nBut if I survived the hyenas, I'd soooo want to shove hyena meat down his throat...
dan ur the man
this guy needs to take shrooms
I DID follow you on instagram, but then I tried to post a supportive comment on one of your pictures and then seconds later you blocked me, probably because you didn't even bother to read past the first sentence which was, admittedly, a bit of a rough joke. \nI wish I had known how you would respond before wasting my breath typing something sincere and well-meaning...
_ALWAYS BE YOURSELF!_ \nUnless you can be a Viking. \nThen . . .  *Always* *be* *a* *VIKING!*
Things will change, but not always for the worse.  Sometimes change is scary and fantastic.  Don't let change keep you from enjoying life.
Emily Hart has a degree???
I wish I had known to buy Apple stock shares. I wish I had known to learn to make YouTube videos on the first day!
Here's one:  You will never be a Kung Fu master.  In fact, you will never be even remotely proficient at Kung Fu.  You will however become quite adept at the face block, i.e. using your face to block a punch.
9:22 , room for a big one !
You forgot the one about when the older version of you shows up (or anybody who has lived shows up) -  LISTEN to their advice.  I dismissed so much wisdom from older family and friends but now realize they would just sharing the things they thought a young person should know.  And they would right!\n Love your video and the whole channel.  Keep on sharing.
You are the best Emily! LOVE FOR YOU
The you that you are seems to be quite ok to the me that is me
it's a bit like Crime Emily
All so VERY true!
Buts its ok guys live in your fantasy. Just to expose you for what you are.....you are not a woman anyways. You have an adams apple . Prominent brow ridge too. Wow i knew most of hollywood is made of trannys but i guess youtube is the next invasion . Blind leading the blind.
One of those should have been learn about the power of compound interest.
A BOTTLE OF VODKA IN THE FREEZER, AND A LITTER BOX THAT NEEDS TO BE EMPTIED... THATS YA FUTURE.
This is one of the best videos that you've done. Just awesome -\nThank you
I wish I had known that I am lactose intollerent, and I have a digestive system that will get very weak over time.

Some of the nicest people have crooked teeth so don't worry.
what I wish I had known...\n1. alcohol is the only way to happiness after fifty\n2. only date those who think you're too good for them\n3. being annoying is more fun than having friends\n4. those who like me Don't know me yet
The 2nd one.I totally identify with that one.
LOve you Emily, i can relate to you very much
I wish I had known that I had Asperger's, so I wouldn't have tried so hard to succeed in life.
Good to have you back aunty Em. 😅😅👌
how many? Many.... lol\nAnd here I thought you were such a chaste young lady

Work to Live not Live to work\n\nMy Top Ten i did copy a few from you +Emily Hart
Excellent topic choice. Good news  your degree. Think about the discipline and the topics you trained in, include web access to adult peoples curious mind which is the predominant *nature of a child, curiosity. Oops looks like your degree has got you there*, just not in the way you expected it too or in the format you trained in , however if you apply the principles/ axioms of your degree, then you can see why you are such a success. Fun fact for you: The brain keeps growing until the age of 30, often people perform better in exams intellectually in adulthood. You and your topics are as a matter of fact very intellectual. Your genius is in the way you convey, it. Thank you keep up the good work .
Interesting and very relevant,I liked especially what you said about change.  And yes you do swear too much...😊 But I still love you... take care Brian.
professional rhymer - I seem to recall that there's a word for that sort of person. Glad you took some time off, it's always good to get away for awhile. Just don't do it for too long, or too often. I can only hold my breath for so long, you know.
Loved this video! Nice one Emily. 👍
Boy. You nailed it with the school thing! Especially in the area of the value of a degree. Oh. By the way, you would be beautiful even if you were MISSING teeth, so don't sweat a little crookedness ;)
Nice Emily. When a person is younger they think all this shit means everything, but as you get older you see that you just need to say what the fuck, and do what makes you happy, and push all the bullshit in this world to the side.
#1 True story. My DAD told me when I was a teenager, Son, Everybody is not going to like you, Just shit you got to live with. I took that to hart. It worked for me! Their Loss.
One thing I wish I had known... that women are fucking crazy... and good luck on being in any relationship for any length of time... oh, and none of your dreams ever come true... fuck you universe!
Just realized I don't follow you on Instagram! I feel so ashamed. Great video though Emily! Love your advice and I'm excited for more videos to come!
Your face is pretty and I like looking at it.
Miss Em, This should be mandatory viewing for anyone about to turn into a teenager.
Honestly I can relate so much to number 4 specifically and hearing you speaking about it and giving your thoughts on it was amazing for me to hear! This video in general was so helpful!
If children and young students really understood how poorly achievements in school translated into success as an adult, the drop out rate, along with failing school grades would skyrocket.
And the one about don't try too hard; I didn't try too hard and that's why I got pretty much F*** all out of GCSE's and A Levels..... I still might try University yet, but I need to find something that really suits me and a way to make it work foe me and with me , if ya get me.
I missed you Em, thanks for doing another video x
You're still hot I see
we all need a TARDIS , just think ...
@swearing: it's much less of a deal in germany, believe me! it's always quite funny to see how not-so-lady-like women from the UK or US apologise for or worry about those kinds of things. also it's a little sad to see such pressure to behave in a certain way. \n\ni mean, we do have social situations where it is absolutely NOT ok to use swear words, sure, and some where it may raise an eyebrow or two, but in general, when someone has a reason to swear, (s)he swears. \n\nabove all, there's not THAT huge a difference between men and women regarding swearing. it may be a little amusing for many when a woman swears like a drayman (as a german saying goes), because, despite our hun-like, blunt and barbaric nature^^ we do have a concept of lady-like, but seemingly we are more comfortable with a greater variety of female behaviour. \n\ngreat video, as always! have a nice weekend! :-)
What shoe size are you ?
I just love it when you say,and ten. You look so relaxed and pleasant. I liked your video very much. I may show this to my daughter. Though maybe at a later time. She is only 6 now. Cheers. Well done!
you could end your shows with a clever ending, maybe something cute... oh how about ending each episode with a pajama dance. I bet people would love it!!!!
I understand the whole concept that something better will come along and that it will happen unexpectedly. But we are always taught actions have consequences. That has both positive and negative meanings. The relevance of that here is if you prepare for something then only you will get it. You will have to work for it. This is something firmly ingrained in most of us. The hardest part for me is about the time I have to wait between I don't have the thing I want to have and then I have it. It is really hard to stay positive and focussed on the goal that you are trying to achieve.
I was fortunate to have someone hate my fucking guts based on my ernest open eye contact, genuine smile and (not too) firm hand-shake, in my early twenties. Hadn't even had a chance to offend him! That was when I truly internalised 'No matter how nice you are, not everyone will like you (and some will FUCKING HATE you)'
Don't write down all your account passwords.  You can get programs that store them.  I use KeePass but there's plenty of others.  And if you're going that route since you don't have to remember  them, you can make all your passwords different and more complex so you're a lot less vunarable to cracking
Be yourself is the best one! There is nothing at all wrong with swearing at all, just only in certain situations really (common sense). Like I have never sworn in front of my parents and I swear every second sentence around most everyone else :D
I wish I had been told:\n1. Donald Trump is not a comedienne, he just says funny shit\n2.Jeremy Corbyn is a comedienne, and does not say funny shit\n3. Piers Morgan is not a comedienne, he just talks shit
Instead of writing down you passwords use a product like lastpass. https://lastpass.com/f?3384546
Funny you bring up swearing.  A friend and I were discussing this, and here's what we came up with.  Have you ever heard someone lament how 'in our grandparents day, you didn't swear in a public place.  Or  how a man was expected to wear a suit if he was in public.?  I think some people miss the dignity that comes with NOT letting it all go in front of each other.  If I met you for a date at a nice restaurant in sweat pants, it would give you pause, right? Swearing used to be considered vulgar, right?   Well, If I gave you the once over and told you what I thought you'd be willing to do in bed, you'd throw a drink in my face, and walk out, because you still consider that to be vulgar,  when once swearing would have been just as offensive.\n    Well, Maybe it's about what we each define as respect.  It's like that joke blaming the cartoon Teenage Ninja Turtles for teaching a generation of boys that it's ok to live in mom's basement, subsist on Pizza and call your girlfriend 'dude'.  \n     I for one still do not swear in front of my grandparents, or older aunts and uncles.  It feels good, respectful not to.  I don't want a girlfriend who is ok with me calling her dude, belching or farting around her, because she deserves to not be treated like one of my high fiving jackass mates.  \n\nOFcourse, not swearing doesn't make me think I am better than anyone, or judging anyone.  Just a really good topic this, Miss Hartridge, and it sparked my old debate brain.
Out of curiosity.Would you have listened,if anyone told you all this when you were young?\nBtw how bout making a 10 movies that made an everlasting impression/impacted you.Either in your youth or as an adult .Or both
You end shows with the pyjamas dance!
Even if current you had access to a time machine and went back in time to visit your younger teenage self to give advice. Your teenage self wouldn't believe anything you had to say.
I wasn't listening but you look fecking great ;)
you should stop saying I don't know how to end shows, it was bye.  No more doubts, A phrase that came from St. Pete.  Use it.  Have faith, You got atleast one sweet pete, and what was it, three arrows or something, so I say sit back, have a popcorn, put in a movie, and...Reach for the stars/surrender yourself to good times.  I have not a clue what to say.  I usually am quite thorough, I thought you looked amazing, btw.  I was hoping for a classic 10 reasons why, with the numbers and everything.  Thank you for answering my wish.  You are as adorable as the day I met you.  As Gandalf said to Bilbo in Lord of the Rings,  you haven't aged a day   So to all your smoothies, and tisanes,  Whole foods, and fine wines, free from fear over here is forwarding you thins message: keep it up.  Thin like slim but differen.  OD on Dissos and you will meet gOD.  Disso you know I reserved a time with you and my divine disco enferno to us finally unwind and fill up on magic mind and know how to rhyme.  Behind the frying pan is a man with a plan to stand at ease please just release your energy on me, she is queen on the boobtube I mean youtube it was something about boobs how we crossed paths, who knew, you drew me in and then I had a thing, 5 year anniversary approaching.  How do you want to celebrate.  A bottle of merlot, a candle, and filtered lighting, a gentle breeze, a phat bowl of eMeXPay, ouch he makes you pay is what I'm hearing.  Will you come to my hearing.  Hear how I plowed down a mad clown.  Mushroom Mushroom we all fall down.  Ok you love my lies, like me less when I'm committing adultery and kinda of feel this is getting salty.  Salvage things like I love you and you're so gosh darn pretty.  Ok I'm going to cash in this crop of wurm castings(English)and make out with my arm or something.  You have a heart.  I know. Bye. :)
Just be glad you didn't grow up in China. College exams are the BE ALL and END ALL.
Why not end your shows with your beautiful wink?
It's quite obvious how much you've changed/grown in what seems like no time at all. Couldn't agree more with you being stronger, happier and more independent. I'm very happy for you. Enjoyed the video.    S.A. and Til Next Time       :  )
Great video, you are beautiful.
The password thing is a definite. I always forget those damned things.
I've good teeth genes and I'm ambidextrous [my hands, just my hands, and really just my hands]
one thing about and one of the main reasons i watch i can tell that you dont think your better than any one eles green eyes
I can relate a 100 %
The braces one is SPOT ON 😂 fuck my life.
Emily, I Love your everything, but you look bad your eyes and neck look very bad like you have been up for days and days. I think that the one thing you did not say was You might want a friend for life and you might think he/she is that friend, but if you ask them they will say WHO like you are the last person they think about
Hello Emily. How are you today?
Thanks , going to discuss with my teenage daughter !
I agree with all of this! :)
Lots of people have that lower twisted tooth, including myself and Bobby DiNero, so you're in good company. Your advise is well taken for the youngsters to keep their retainers in at night but as far is you are concerned, chalk it up to a distinctive character trait. I think you look better now than ever especially with that 50 Amp smile.  Also a long time ago a friend gave me some really good advise. She said  Don't wast time with people who don't like you. That little piece of advise really made things lots easier.
Wish I knew that being twenty doesn't make my life put together neither makes me an adult. Smh*
Emily,\nI'm glad you're on Youtube and not on TV. On TV they'd just try to control and censor the way you act.\nOn Youtube, you can just be yourself.
I just like watching you talk. O_o good stuff tho, makes sense.
Good luck teaching brits about dental care
Great Work Em.
Stop fucking swearing
Never try amphetamines
I needed this..thanks, Em!
Really great talk.
Great video Em!
Good advice
you yeti ~~ahaha
i love it :)
you rule kiddo
Fun video Emily, thanks.
Good luck.
Glad you're back
Bad luck Emily (teeth)
Erm ... hmmm ... errr ... well ...  speechless
So quirky, cute, and fit lol.
Part 2! Part 2! Part 2!?!?
You seem very likeable 👍
Emily use lastpass for your passwords it will change your life.

I have no idea what I just watched.
This ain't Mortal Kombat da fuck is this shit
what happened to her, she looks like mid 40s with all those wrinkles and shit.
Awesome, Ex-Machina was great and Natalie is my favorite actress\nAnnihilation (2018) is going to be a great Movie\nParamount Pictures fans gifts \nGet here https://goo.gl/tmCN2H
Thor where you at? Ya jawn acting up
That *Bwhooom* sound appeares in every Apocalypse movie..
Night after night, that sound, out amid the swamp--a low moaning, cries near and far, loud in tall grass.
Why did my husband volunteer for a suicide mission? He auditioned for a suicide squad and was turned down.
Finally a trailer that's a trailer!
i hope they arnt mashing all 3 books together
*Spoiler Alert* It's a plant organism that turns you into a plant, think The Ruins meets the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the catch at the end of the movie is that the leader is Swamp Thing played by Donald Trump himself, Cheech and Chong also do cameo appearances in the movie.
After arrival this one looks genre defining
Natalie Portman? Say no more. Color me a few bucks lighter.
I never thought I'd miss someone actually telling me plot/villain/why I should care/stakes of the movie haha, but I didn't get them from this
Awesome TEASER! \nI don't know what to do?! Check this video out :) \nhttps://youtu.be/Aee6Sl9EvsA
Her voice change at the end??? Probably gave the film away lul
I’m surprise I didn’t read any comment of Stranger Things.. I thought there were some similarities in it :) I love natalie Portman.. can’t wait to watch this!
Why do this genre of movie trailers have a lot of bass thrown in them?
It's gonna be awesome because 1) Ex Machina was awesome and 2) Oscar Isaac
So what is it about ?
Funny they are showing the world in such a collapsed state... almost as if it were to be completely destroyed by a nuclear war... seems fishy considering the recent tensions uprising between USA and the rest of the world (NK, China..) Same with that Geostorm movie?
Surprised Natalie's not crying yet. It seems thats what she does best.
The book fucked me up so I'll have to see this
This film is super reminiscent of “Stalker” (1979)
niii dont reeally get it...
GINA. MF. RODRIGUEZ.

Something about Natalie Portman pisses me off.
I get the Arrival vibe.
Jane the virgin with a machine gun? 😂 #gofeminism
Don't do drugs kids
Snore
Some day the film industry will stop using that annoying sound in the background of every trailer. \nI just have to be a little more patient.

white boy feet videos on my channel check them out!!!!!!! 👣👣👣
Thank you. *THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS*
It's a shame that the video is not in 4K resolution...
where are all the plastic bags?
All of this and we still don't have any solid video evidence of mermaids or the Lochness monster
How is it a prequel if it's Blue Planet II? THAT DOES NOT COMPUTE!
The earth is so damn beautiful, I hope humans dont destroy it
Great promo! Will this be made available in 4K?

This video is more beautiful than my life.
Ah looks like the ocean has been updated, looking forward to version 2.0
Wow!!!!! my jaw dropped to the floor! the music kept me stunned cravingg for more fottage like thet! Hans Zimmer is the absolute king in everything about music. great choice!
The people who downvote this video are all eligible for the Mission to Mars. Please contact NASA for further information.
@3:21 This is why nobody on earth matches the BBC when it comes to wildlife documentaries. AMAZING, SPELLBINDING, MAGICAL!
I've never been do excited.
They should call this an Earth Shaped Pool...
this + planet earth II = the best cinematic experience ever
I do not understand the dislikes.
On a par with astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, Sir David Attenborough shows us nature with his genius here and as usual, the best of how to bring science of remote Earth to our everyday lives. Fantastic music - I bought some Hans Zimmer music on CD earlier this year - brilliant to merge with Radiohead. Spine tingling to mind bending. We love it. Nature stays within our minds as we wonder and will never ever stop... @ClaireCSmith
Nature is so spectacular I hope we preserve it
I’ve been waiting soooo long for this
Stunning!!  The BBC has done it again....Outstanding photography. Can't wait!!
We need to save this planet. Let's clean up the oceans!
Any idea when it comes out!!??
Iam going to buy a new tv for this!  David is the grandad I never met but such a big part of my life
Have you heard of 4Ocean?\nIf you care about the ocean, check it out.
I absolutely cannot wait for this masterpiece to air. BBC documentaries have had a huge part in my childhood. So much so, that I am currently in education aspiring to be a conservationist because of the BBC! Never stop educating the world about natural history BBC Earth! 😁
Can the next person to give this a thumbs down please explain their reasoning? We'd all love to know.
Quite literally every frame from this could be my computer’s wallpaper
If these are the unused clips imagine how good the ones being used are.
I hope they will show this at IMAX or something else suitably big. It deserves a BIG screen. Stunning
breathtaking..... that's all i can say
OMG!!!! I am sooooooooooo excited!!! This is gonna be amazing! I have to say, you never disappoint XD
This is awesome. But I kinda dislike fake sound effects
BBC at its best (y)
How foolish we would be to think that all this came about by natural processes
*CAN YOU PEOPLE PLEASE USE LANA DEL REY MUSIC PLEASE*
I hope he don't sing in the series...
the cinematography always amazed me.. and sir david attenborough narration is stunning
My home boy DAVID! What would we do without him
Incredible. I grew up on. I am so excited to see that they are making this
Blue Planet II: the squeekquel!
We have to destroy all things, all species!
You sure that's not uranus?
I just got chills all over.
Looks good. Not as good as Shark Week, but still pretty cool.
This is going to be amazing
I have been in speechless awe maybe twice in my life and Sir David and Hans Zimmer each were partially responsible for one of the two.  Now it has been a third time and they are both in on it together which caused a fourth time.
God made this world so beautiful.
CAN'T WAIT!!! Still have the original on DVD.
Wow, there is no way I'm not going to watch that.
Awesome.....  I never seen before like this.... Amazing creativity of god and capture by man...
Our responsibility to protect it and our fault if it dies.
Hans Zimmer and Radiohead.  No wonder that soundtrack feels so epic and melancholy.
my god this is beautiful
Donald Trump is one of the 71 dislikes.
Amazing!!! This is a gift.
Hans Zimmer, Radiohead, Attenborough, and Blue Planet as the subject matter? Someone pinch me, this is too perfect :)
I had to change both Siri and Alexa's voice to that of David Attenborough just because...
I'm I really on this planet which has these ????\nIt looks like an amazing commercial for ET tourism !!!\nAmazing... Wowwww
Dude the old guy from Jurassic Park is narrating this?!? I’m so excited to watch this while baked
The sad thing is, this will likely be streamed at 720p off of iPlayer
This is so beautiful 😭🌊🌊😭😭💕
Planet Earth II and now this. Going to buy 4K TV soon just for this.
In a time of continued celebrity circus and never-ending political spectacle, efforts like this are a true ray of hope for mankind.
Mother planet is amazing.  she deserves more Love from us.
Honestly thought it'd be about the prehistoric oceans n that
WOW, this next Finding Nemo has really great CGI!
Can't wait for this!
Open your mouth wide you know whats going inside
if we keep screwing up everything you see in this video will no longer exist, and will only exist though memories and film. the children of the future will not know what it will be like to see through crystal clear water into colorful reefs, or even how big a whale is. The path humanity is heading down will only end up in complete extinction of every animal... i know how his is depressing but hell, species go extinct every day....
Hey Blue Planeth... you forgot to cross your h at the end. Just wanted to let ya know.\n-Blue Planeth 1
You had me at Dancing Yeti Crabs.
what lense did you use ? :_)
美哭了
Hanz Zimmer hell yes
Blue plane you mean
Love it.
so many amazing animimals
amazing video.Thank you.
This makes me emotional.
Radiohead and Hans Zimmer. Wow.
So happy!
I wish Attenborough narrated my life.
Good editing video...
Can't wait!!
Breathtaking !!!
Impatiently waiting. Superb!!
Amazing !!!!!😰😢😭😂😅😁
Breathtaking beautiful SubhanAllah

omgomgomgomg Arnold's finger didn't fall it's a miracle
What would happen if u put arnold in the deepest ocean?
This video manages to be sadistic and educational at the same time
Arnold should try an extreme version of the coke and mentos challenge
Next Video i suggest : How long can you stay in water for
Why do you hate Arnold, he didn't do anything wrong
Do different doses of differnt kinds of the most poisonous and venomous substances on earth
You've got my sub well done

mountain was renamed in honour of Barack Obama.\nMount Obamas height is 1318 feet.\nNot 1317 or 1319 but 1318 feet.\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nMount Obama sits opposite Christian valley or you could say it opposes it.\n\nThe Lord obviously wants believers aware Obama is the Antichrist, combined with the word of God id say this is rock solid proof\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z1jzO_cYb_U\n\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nRevelation 7:4\n\nAnd I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.\n\nWhilst doing some research on #antichristobama i was amazed to find the following calculation.\n\nWe know Obama was born on August the 4th which is the 216th day of the year.\n\nIf we take the 144000 witnesses who will be Obamas worst enemies on the earth besides the 2 witnesses and divide the 144000 by  216 it works out at\n666.666666666\nSo thats FOUR sets of 666 if ever there was a doubt.\nOr\nDivide 144000 by 666 which works out at 216.216216216\n\nSo many pointers to Obama being Mr Lightning from Heaven.\n\n\nBARACK BUSTED IN REVELATION 13:18\n[url]https://youtu.be/8fNSR7yAIvo[/url]
I love Zac so much,  I wish I could meet him!!!
He kind of sort of sounds like Zayn. But he rolls his words a little bit more. And btw congrats Zac, and Vogue, this is way better than some of those fake af 73 questions.
What a beautiful man
Thank you Jesus his perfect
I get a robot-like vibe from him. He's putting a mask on, showing what he thinks the viewers want to see. Its not a bad thing, just make it hard connect with him.
I'd smash no homo tho
W H A T U P
This boy is beautiful and funny🙌
So obvious he’s trying to seem relatable to teen/20yo girls.
I didn't even blink watching his pretty face! OGM he's so gorgeous

You insult wonder women and your dead to me. Omg and Emma Watson. People are so mean
I am Kyser Holcomb, from Zenica living in Chicago. I quickly want to use this medium here to recommend the effort of Mr Mark Hendrix who assisted me in my efforts to get a loan, I was in need of an urgent loan of 80,000.00 and so many months of trying to get a loan online proved abortive, i was frustrated and i lost hope because i had bad credit and even the banks turned me down until i came in contact with him. I applied for a loan from him, the loan was approved easily without stress and all the preparations where made concerning the loan transfer and in exactly 3 days I received my loan in my bank account. If you really need a legitimate loan without stress, please do well to contact his company at markhendrixloanfirm@gmail.com\n\nThey may not know am doing this but i pray that God will bless them for the good thing they have done for me and I strongly believe other persons are testifying.
Side note: jake gyllenhaal does have a starry-eyed pug face but he's handsome though
GADOT HAS NO CHEST. SORRY. BUT ITS A FACT.
You leave Wonder Woman alone!!
Last one was a sick burn
Gwyneth does need to shut up. But vaginal steaming is bad too, mmkay?
Lmao the last one was straight savage.
Keaton's reaction was perfect.
I'm surprised Kumail is classified as a celebrity because I've been a fan for so long, but I'm glad he was featured 😂😂
Screw kimmel and his anti trump propaganda.  Trump 2020 and ivanka in 2024. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
AND I THOUGHT I HAD A HORRIBLE SPANISH ACCENT,  AND THEN THERE'S GAL!!! GOD DAAAAAAAMN GIRL YOU LOOK BETTER WITH THAT MOUTH CLOSED!!! HAHAHAHAH!!!!
Maybe the last one wasn't a mean tweet, lol.\n#TakeNoChances
The SNL one was right on.
Didint expect so many legendary celebrities I actually like, but theres always like 4 I dislike.
The boob is not enough. The breast is way to small.
Jim parsons one was great
How can ANYONE say something mean about Gal Gadot?
Gal is perfect...the way she read it.  I love how she looked down when she said titties lol.  She isn't flat chested, a B cup isn't flat..
Saved the best for last 😂
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart

The first one hit home with her.
lmao the Jim Parson's one killed me
First off how can anyone say anything bad about gal gadot????
I don't watch a lot of content from any talk show anymore, but I always watch these, they're fantastic
He told your mom to send him Bob's and vagene
IT'S ABOUT TIME THIS CAME BACK!!!!!!
“Every shade of your mom’s lipstick” has got to be the best thing I’ve heard in a while.
Emma's one is unfortunately a bit true
Haha cheers to the last one
Emma Watson looks like she's aged about 10 years since Beauty and the Beast wtf happened?
Jennifer Lawrence and Kumail Nanjiani's answers were my favorite ones 😂😂
I LOST IT ON THE LAST ONE HAHAHA
Trinity killer does have a ballsack face
You know Dave could have destroyed that guy if he wanted to lol.
God Gal Gadot is so cute. Her real personality and the way she plays Wonder Woman is so similar and that's really cool.
THE LAST ONE IM CHOKING
Tfw The president wrote one of the mean tweets and not as a joke
Don't talk about gal like that
i see gal gadot, i click. it's that easy
2:46 HE'S SO SAVAGE 😂😂
2:05 probably because of your nudes.
I dont even like Kumail Nanjiani like that but his comeback was fire! he won the whole #11 mean tweet video
Last one was the best! Lmao
The last one deserves a place in top 10 anime comebacks
Saved the best for last lmaoo

I'd love to have been there why they binge watched this for their review. Anyone up for another Trek Binge watching after this? *my hands raised*
Voyager is the best.
No jokes about the hologram rooms and how they never are truly safe?
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
OMG, when you said it sounded like the writers fell asleep at their keyboards I thought you were joking, like you were going to show some examples with bad dialog someone might have written while they were tired and couldn't think of anything, but no... it really sounded like the results of face for real smacked down on the keyboard made it in! XD That's just the best.
I forgot about the palm punches. Always thought that was... odd.
Please do one honest trailer for Doctor Who series. Please please please please.
7:46 needs to be a gif
I always thought Counciller Troy was insanely hot.
I was glad to see this. It was a breath of fresh air compared to that garbage Star Trek TV show released in 2017.
Honest Trailers, back in form!  Well done.  Never could resolve the contradiction of this supposed kick-butt Klingon that was always getting HIS butt kicked.
I vote for Sisko, even when he’s not listed as an option.\n\nCan we see a DS9 Honest Trailer?
Some episodes were so cheesy But I liked them anyways 😆
They say about how you have to subscribe to that CBS service in the US to watch the new series whereas they could have made a joke that it’s available on Netflix in the other 188 counties Nexflix counties it’s available in.
You're not Nanna. Nanna's dead.
Please Say: “I Am A Minion. A Despicable Minion”
For the Hef, please say, I always say now that I'm in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.
No one pokes fun at TNG. Especially not my boi Picard! You've gone too far sir!
Please do Doctor Who!
You forgot 'Cry Manly Tears whenever you hear a flute ... for the rest of your life. Seriously, that never goes away.'
Put together this way, I didn't realize there were so many stupid things about Star Trek.  I couldn't stop laughing!
What year is it!
Have they done Classic Star Trek?
Disappointed that they didn't mention that half the cast of the show was in FREAKIN' Gargoyles!
Patrick Stewart is a man cursed to look like he is in his 70s his whole life, but hasn't aged a day sense.
THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS.
Being honest is good but asking questions about where being honest comes from... now that's even better. Makes you think, that's what we want. \n~TMF
please say : who would win a fight , between darth vader , indiana jones , neo and the epic voice honest trailers man ? isn't obvious ; epic voice man !
say THE WILD BEAST INSIDE YOU, WOKE UP THE WILD BEAST INSIDE ME
Only thing that got me excited was troy at 4:53\n\nLol. Ohh! Very funny yeah.
This honest trailer was GOLD!
Do Smoke signals is a classic that needs to become relevant
This says it all about TNG. What we loved, were amused, and many more emotions. Thank you
I've been binge watching TNG on Netflix lately. The description of Riker - 😂😂😂😂
We're nearly merged now.
space ghost is definitely a space vampire.
Really, you went with Trek Fighter? Not Trekken? I am disappointed
Kansas reference in the viewer comments made me squeal xD xD xD
the borg is the greatest villain? i think  the dominion had the U.F.P. on their toes more
I don’t understand why they couldn’t have just made Picard British; making him French just seemed so pointless.
I could never do the Riker Maneuver 'cause I'm way too short. :(
Wow, 20 years and I just noticed this 'The Riker Maneuver' !
voyager and ds9 next!!! they both have space ghost in them too!
OH GOD I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT EPISODE!\nBless your hearts, Honest Trailers, bless your hearts.
do pirates of the caribbean 5!!! do-it
There are 4 Lights! Still gets me to this day. Such a good episode.
Please say, I know it was you Fredo. You broke my heart.
Watched the video just to see the meme
Please do Death note Honest trailer
I'm sure there are more than a few of us who want to see you do Origin wars/Osiris Child
I also never watched this show but the Riker manoeuvre just killed me
I LOVE LOVE Star Trek: The Next Generation.....
Do the Movie IT!!!!!!!
That is what I am talking about! Do Wrath of Khan!
Picard >Janeway>SevenOfNine>Kirk\n\nActually let me correct myself\n\nSevenOfNine>Picard>Janeway> Kirk\n\nAnd I know seven of nine wasnt a captain but she'd be the best.
I laughed. I cried. I wheezed. I called 911. Great job...this might be my favorite Honest Trailer.
Totally sold out, used to be better.
Kinda a sad fact: Every original cast member who guest starred in this series is dead. Not shitting you.
the Riker part ! DAMN! love it!
I love Star Trek way more than any Star Wars movie. And I think we can all agree that it is better in every way.
That episode were he shouts about the four lights(Chain of Command part 2) was my favorite episode of any TV show from growing up.
TNG is my favourite of all the Treks and the details they mentioned in this vid are freaking hilarious! Adding this one to my favourites. Thank you, thank you, thank you! P.S. The one where Picard turned into a child was hilarious.
Imagine the hours spent looking for these chips, nightmare
And now I have to binge the whole show again, and possibly Voyager and DS9.  Thanks, Honest Trailers.  Say goodbye to what little life I had.
When the Picard Maneuver was credited, I thought, you know, I hope they include how Riker-- and then I literally screamed with laughter.  All of this is so true.
Much as I dislike the shilling for T-Mob, I have to say 'well played' on this one. ;-) I can't BELIEVE I missed 'The Riker Manouver' considering how much TNG I watched over the years, and noted so many other tropes, especially Worf's essential sissieness.
I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at an Honest Trailer. Ku flippin' Dos.
Although, to be fair, the 'Riker Maneuver' is really the 'Clark Gable Maneuver'.  Made famous in the classic movie 'It Happened One Night'.
best honest trailer ever I laughed my ass off
for the record, the answer is and always will be benjamin sisko aka borgbane.
Alternatively... What about an Honest Trailers for Halloween the movie, just in time for the Holiday? Huh? Huh? Yeah!
Do That 70's Show plz. :)
You didn't mention Tasha Yar? That makes me sad. I loved her, she kicked ass, took names, and didn't afraid of anything.
*SHUT UP, WESTLEY*
Picard > Kirk
Love it!
21st century???

What's not to love about frogs?\n\n\n\nPoison/toxic.
I want a pet frog now 😕
I hope no frogs were stepped on lol IDK I always freak out when walking at night cause I hope that I dont kill anything!
9:10 you have pretty eyes :3
maybe you should meet me then...cuz i hate frogs and toads...have a small fear of them
That's the frog species they found a few years ago that looks a lot like Kermit.
I'd rather look at see-through frogs than another person getting dragged off of a plane.
I can see him.
woah 8 million subscriber didnt even notice that back in the day while i was watching you its just 6 million keep it up beat popularmmos :)!!!
I am worried that you dont know what the word invisible means...
Aren't these types of frogs artificial?
Your the best brave wilderness
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
3:55 how the hell did he step in that puddle and no water/mud hit the lens?!?!?
I am terrified of frogs, however if it is in a container and CANT get to me, I would love to examine it!:) some goes for insects, NOT SPIDERS THO
i would like to see these frogs jump in slow-mo
He should come to New Zealand
I guess this was recorded before the hurricane
That flash blinded me through my phone
My favorite video of yours yet. Great find
this guy really has life figured out.
When Coyote said 'Kermit, come back' i just died laughing.😂😂😂
Go to Indonesia and get a reticulated python
I don't like frogs.
If its invisible then how did you saw it?
I wanted to see the glass frog eat something.
AWWWW THE FROG IS SO CUTE 😂
The first frog looked like Kermit the frog 😂
I love the amount advantage that you take from such  lovely place like Costa Rica, you go there every now and come back with such an amazing video always.\nThanks lots!
A big part of who you are is invisible .... \n\n\n\n\n& untouchable.
that was soo cool....awesome job
I know this is a video about frogs, but can we talk about the random skull on 4:12 \nWhere is the rest of the skeleton? What was it? How the heck did it get out there? And why is the skull so clean?
isn’t it dangerous to be out there at night?
With invisible frogs, could there be an invisible man? Don't know... but I'll ask the questions!
I love frogs too their so cool!
Why do you guys talk like its a script now
Google the word invisible.
He's lucky the spider didn't kill him when he grabbed that second frog
Ask Collin To go on a Adventure with you to find animals!
I've got a bearded dragon lizard

Costa Rica es demasiado hermosa 😎
It’s hard to watch gmm before bed, I get so hungry lol
Rhett is king of order
A little piece of me dies every time someone pronounces tortilla as, tour-till-ah. Just throwing that out there. 😳
heart near rent ghacfw love nightmare reasonable artist port chemical reply.
It's called ... my opinion. And my opinion is based on what I see, and ALL THEY DO IS EAT IN THE NEW SEASON.. prove me wrong??? XXXXXXX YA CANT.. because 95% of this season has been them eating... how many times can that be entertaining? I LOVE RHETT & LINK! I just want to see more of THEM! Not what they like to EAT!!,,,, show after show, after show, after show.
Pumpkin ravioli are delightful. Where I live we eat them.
The crew was giggly in this one. Laughing at things that weren't even funny.
has anybody else noticed that these guys really don't like each other?
I feel like these should actually be two tests, one pumpkin spice and one pumpkin. Pumpkin spice as an ingredient is different than just plain pumpkin as an ingredient.
Wish there was a Trader Joe’s in Hawaii. They’re prices for what they offer rivals Costco nix the bulk.
Rhett is aging like wine. I just want to run my fingers through that pretty hair.
Why do people not know that Pumpkin flavor and pumpkin spice are not the same? Pumpkin is pumpkin and pumpkin spice means no pumpkin at all, but rather cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Do the crew laugh more and more each episode? I've watched through all their videos and their most recent videos seem more and more distracting
The hastings stole the show.
Wayyyyy too much crew laughter. I hope somebody sees this because it's legitimately distracting\nLove you guys, glad everyone is having fun and all, but makes it hard to watch, at least for me
If the crew is going to be this loud in the mix, we should see some shots of them while they're laughing or Rhett and Link should interact with them more.
Pumpkin spice makes me drink more to care less ,
I can't be the only one who went back to check if Link was actually wearing the shirt the whole time right?
THIS IS MY KIND OF VIDEO. I LOVE PUMPKIN SPICE EVERYTHING. THANKS FOR THIS.
I'd just like to point out that basically none of those were actually labeled as Pumpkin Spice, and there is a big difference between pumpkin spice and just pumpkin.
Was that a jojoke
Link : I would just spread it on things because,  HALLOWEEN \nlmao
these guys get funnier all the time. so different to 3+ years ago
They should do part 2s of some of their will it videos.
You need pumpkin spice cream cheese for the bagles (yes they actualy make it at ralphs)
Hey Rhett, Link, and/or crew.  \nToo much fake laughing in the videos.
so this is basically just a pumpkin taste test i think like one of these was actually pumpkin spice?
Are all of them really laughing? I don't think that there are even people there laughing 😐😐😐😑😒😒😒😒😬😬😬😬😬
That was awesome thanks you guys!I need me some of that soon.
I’m loving the forceful ‘dinks’ this episode 😂
I addicted to goin to Trader Joe's better food imo compared to every company including Costco :)
The taste test videos are always so calming for me. I've got a huge exam tomorrow that I'm super nervous for, so I'm watching this to try and calm down. Works without fail! Other good episodes for this are the blind cheese taste test and the MORE episode where they try soda combinations!
Lol what's that big dog out there in that pasture?... it's a cow
WHO JUST RIPS OPEN A BAG OF BAGELS?!
Link is sinking so violently this episode😂
I love your videos
I just want to thank you Rhett and Link for what you do. No matter what mood I'm in, you guys never fail to crack me up. THANK YOU!!!
It's so awesome and inspiring to see you guys give to good causes. I'm proud to be a fan of yours. Thanks for all you do.
I work at Trader Joe's and have never clicked a video faster!
I wonder if GMM looks at comments at this time (10:30)
Hay GMM I kind put lemon on my coffee that had sugar and it's actually pretty great I was wondering if you can try different hot and cold drinks that might test good together
-That's good.\n-That's bad.\nIf shipping to my country wasnt so expensive I'd probably buy a GMM mug
Pumpkin Joe-Joe's IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?
I don’t really care but why are they laughing at everything
What's your favorite pumpkin spice product and why is it JoJos? (It's a JoJo reference please don't kill me)
Where did Link get his jacket??
Awwww you guys are great, viva Puerto Rico! 🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺
Oh look.. it's a Trader Joe's commercial...
Can u pls bring back the Will It challenges
No, pumpkin is good for dogs too.
i don't know why everyone is complaining about the laughter, i thought it made the video more entertaining
The laughter was a little weird in this one. There was laughter at the strangest of times. I get humor is subjective, but it seems off. \n\nWould you switch these? \nI don't see a need to.\n*laughter*\nDid someone come to work stoned today?
pumpkin jojos, pumpkin bars and the pumpkin cheesecake are TJ's nummiest halloween treats! during halloween last year there were jojo's with chocolate cookies filled with pumpkin filling (nummier than the regular pumpkin jojo's)!
Whoa, their new into song is awesome
I feel like the crew is like a live version of that laughing button they press on old comedy shows
Hey guys go watch my what's in the box challenge!
stop with the fake laughs
Is ANYONE ELSE PISSED OFF AT HOW LINK OPENED THE DAMN BAGEL BAG?! ...my ocd is having a mild panic attack...
blah blah blah crew laughing stop being self entitled. If you don't like the laughing then tough luck.
Have Brian hull on your show!!!!
Dogs do eat pumpkin, give them some (couple of tablespoons) to help their constipation go away, and a big plus, they love it. You're welcome
Do a mint episode then!
Is it just me or do I smell pumpkins rn...
10:05\nRhett: that's good\nLink: that's bad\n😂
Is that a Joe-Joe reference?!
I swear to g-d they've used that intro before...
I love the crew, but not everything Is that funny and they're really annoying
One time I tryed pumpkin spice gum and it tasted like bubblegum and pumpkin. It was pretty good.
We give our dogs plain tinned pumpkin mixed with their dry dog food at dinner and sometimes breakfast. Not to be weird but it helps them poop. 💩🎃👌🏻
Dogs do eat Pumpkin aswell Link
I hate pumpkin.
pumpkin and pumpkin spice are different
I legit smelt pumpkin after watching this
Joe Joe's Bizarre Adventure
stop the laughing, ruining the channel
Shane already did a pumpkin everything smoothie lol

Why the dog treats?
happy happy happy- phil robertson
Oldest Giant Roadside Coffee Pot In North America....wow...thats a lot of words to be proud of...\n\n\n\n\nHi I'm standing next to the largest Japanese sweet potato chip bag with 13 chips and 26 crumbs in the western part of Kyoto.
Rhett: You know, when you stick your head in a pumpkin every Halloween. . .
Everyone who is saying the laughing is annoying... NO YOUR ANNYOING IF YOU COMMETING THAT! THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY FOR GOSH SAKE LET THEM FREAKING LAUGH! SO SHUT YOU GOSH DANG MOUTH BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO IS COMMETING THAT IS ANNOYING AND STUPID!\n\nGO AHEAD AND FREAKING DISAGREE! I DONT CARE! YOU JUST ALL NEED TO THE THE FREAK UP!\n\n(To:Rhett,Link and Crew\n        Wanted this comme to be kid friendly. So I did not use any curse words.)
The chips are delicious, especially with the salsa.
The fact that they knew that the dog treats didn't have pumpkin in it just proves to show how normal this is for them 😂
WHEN LINK AWKWARDLY GOES IN TO DINK IT BUT RHETT HAS ALREADY SANK IT SO LINK TOUCHES THE SPOON THATS BEEN IN RHETTS MOUTH WITH HIS OWN SPOON
I'm digging Link's jacket. Anyone have any idea where I might be able to get it?

The unnecessary laughing ruined the video
*JOJOS*
Really? Joe joes? How bizarre
Can I get a free subs for no reason?
I was a bit annoyed by laughing, Seemed like every time Rhett and Link opened their mouth the crew was laughing. Still a good episode though.
The oldest giant roadside coffee pot in North America.\n\nAmerica, the land of pointless superlatives ...
These kiddos are growing up way too fast! So adorable <3
omg when emilia steals the tuna then puts her thumb up at the camera. i cant cope HAHAHAHA
Eduardo doing Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes was so stinking cute!
Can you please share your meal plans ? Would be great to get some ideas
lol Emilia know she was busted but didn't care lol
You look so gorgeous Anna!
Before you leave to go to your new house can you PLEASE show us whats behind the secret gate PLEASEEEEEEEE
They're partners in crime.
oh no! they're working together to pull pranks..time for boarding school! quick it's not too late! haha <3 (joking btw)
Hi Anna.  I know you're taking a break from making videos for your channel right now, but I wanted to shout out a video idea I'd be interested to watch, and maybe other would enjoy as well.  I'd love to see a video on how you make a meal plan for the family and some tips for sticking to it!  Thanks for the great videos every day!
MY GOD JONATHAN YOU ARE VERY TIRED!!!!!!!!!!!
How does she have £5 to tip the guy but I haven't got £1 to get my self food
Tuna and sweet corn, that sounds interestingly good!
Soo Funny and cute 1:56 when Alessia moved her feet to ta music
Where are all the subscribers and views going??? 😖
Emília is so nice and Eduardo is so cute singing!!!! Cute kids ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Anna is such an amazing mum❤️😍
I love it when Jonathon puts the camera down n you can watch the kids sneaking around it's so funny😭😹❤️
OMG Anna, basting a turkey, I couldn't stop laughing!
If it was in lreland the delivery man would have been friendlier 💚💚
When Emilia ate the tuna and then looked at the camera 😂😂😂
That was so nice of emilia shes a very cute and generous little girl shes very kind
Emilia has the biggest heart, this warms my heart
Anna you are looking beautiful & healthy. Never let peoples mean comments put you or your family down you are such a loving family, it’s a shame people get so jealous 🌹
That was So sweet of Emilia to use her money to tip the pizza man!! (:\nI love how silly Emilia & Eduardo can be!! LOL!! Too funny. Emilia definitely approved of the tuna and sweet corn!! (:\nAlessia is so darn cute watching her songs!!
Thanks for doing the bio again
Does Emilia have more of a British accent, or Irish accent?
Bless her I wouldn't do thta
Hahaha Emilia and Eduardo make me laugh so much
Jonathan if you’re reading this, you are loosing subscribers big time, if you already know this then maybe think why. I am definitely sure it had something to do with you sponsering the sun. You should do a video explaining
Omg at 1:56 \nSo cute how alessia little toes moves to the rhythm of the songs ❤️
If I'd grew up in such family I probably would of turned gayyyy
Oh my gosh...when Emilia took the tuna and sweet corn then gave the camera a thumbs up, I was DYING!! Hahahahaha
Jonathan is soooo nice and patient with all his children and always happy 😊 he should definitely be on tv doing children's programs,it just comes naturally to him ❤️
It was actually really interesting to see Anna's meal plan. I'm an organizer/planner/list maker, so I'm weird and like to see how others organize their lives lolol
Emilia sneaking to get the corn and tuna was hilarious
Day is not complete without SACCONEJOLYs! 😍
I've wanted to ask for a long time but,   why is Alessia so red on her forhead?
Haha Emilia's thumbs up to the camera as she sneaks tuna fish 😄
My love for your family grows with each new child you bring into this world! I love you guys <3
Those kids, goodness me! Such sweethearts, so generous she is! And Eduardo, stealing those precious moments watching him sing to his favorite show ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
40 seconds to go: omg is Anna gonna end the vlog?? lol :p
As a mom im curious, are all school lunches in the UK like that or is it a private school thing? I live in America (Washington state) and i went to public school and now so do my kids and his lunches are exactly the same as when i was in school... total garbage! Nothing evem remotely healthy or even wholesome! Is it like that in all schools in America? Any input on this is appreciated! I personally think it should be a priority in our country for schools to give our children healthy and nutritious school lunches.
That was awesome editing between the dog walker and Anna at 3:45
Emilia is so sweet for tipping the pizza man with her own money, such a giving heart!
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  no I'm just here to play with my dolls house  and when she took some of the tuna and sweet corn from the bowl 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he was running around the kitchen and alessia looked so cute when she was laughing and smiling at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
I love this family. Thank you for continuing to upload videos, and keep doing what you love. ♥
Emilia is savage eating the tuna and sweet corn and then looking at the camera and doing thumbs up 😂😂😂

🇨🇴M I L L O N A R I O S   F. C. 🇨🇴 01:54 🤘
@1:55 Did Bono just tell someone to fuck off? HA HA
tell me how I knew
I don't like this U2!!!
Waiting since the notification on Twitter for this video. Seeing it with my 8 and 12 years old childrens, waiting to the concert in October in Argentina to go with them.
So awesome. I love U2, they're the best!!
I'm going through so awkward money problems and i know that U2 are going to announce a tour soon that will put me even more in debt.... WORTH IT!\n\nmore gigs in IRELAND please.
Coolest U2 music video in a long time.\n\nOk, you lads have won me over. Took a few listens.
So I guess these guys don't age...
Is it just me that I got so emotional watching this video !? ;~~; No.....Just me?.....Oh Okay >.<
such a legendary man!!!
Is that Anthony Bourdain on bass??? 😂😂😂
Can't wait for songs of experience. Innocence is a great album. Just like all U2 albums. 🤘✌
Beautiful video... U2 are the best! ♡♫
I am so happy.This is beyond awesome! I have loved you guys since the beginning and you have made my year!! 😍😍😍😍😍🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶❤❤❤❤❤Sherry
Cannot wait for full album!!
saw them live and it was awesome ! ❤️
2:28 when Bono hops on one foot then makes that funny face to the camera oh my gosh my heart he's so cute
They look so happy, me too
U2 needs reinvention, or at least a solid album
U2 is the best thing about me :-)
Loving your love of life!!!!
so everyone in this band is freaking TOURIST !!! OH COME ON'
Love the mv!! Brazil here ❤
I'm that annoying person commenting on someone else's video to promote my mediocre covers.
I hope this is on the new iPhone
music video is great! you produce great music when you aren't trying to get the hit single which is what you have been doing for a long time now. just be yourselves and there will be great songs
This video and song are so happy, something we need in these times with constant negativity. Love seeing all four of them interacting with fans and just being happy.
Sounds tired tbh.
Welcome Back
RIP U2: 1980-2000.
Lmao so bad
Like https://youtu.be/_xDIa6WPbWw
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
Scottish?
Why in USA?....NY ?
sounds like fucking oasis
1980-Forever
When did Anthony Bourdain join U2?
Y-you too
Y-you too
يع
🤗🤗🤗U2
1:53 VIVA MILLOS HIJUEPUTA
I LOVE it!!!
Wowww its special

My favourite band 😍😍😍 nice song.
Un vídeo increíble !

U2 is back!!!
FUCKING TASTY
U2
❤️ Lo amé.
U2 will never die
Por fin!!! este vídeo ya nos lo debían desde hace rato, je..\nmuy bien hecho, con mucha  alegría, moderno y sin grandes pretensiones nos dicen desde NY: aquí estamos seguimos vigentes y vamos por mas...\nOjalá y se animen a realizar un vídeo aquí en México, que al igual q Coldplay con su vídeo Head full of dreams, capturen lo verdaderamente Fuerte que tiene este país y lo hace grande: su gente. Ojala y así sea.\nYa falta poco para que vengan y estemos allí, vibrando con su música... SAL_U2  😎
Nada mas hermoso que en el minuto 1:53 cuando aparece la bandera del equipo mas grande de Colombia\n\n\nMILLONARIOS FC ))°°/M((
Gran giño a millonarios FC en el minuto 1:51 grandes!
en el minuto 1:53 aparece la bandera de millonarios fc :) :) la #14 \nMILLOS EN TODAS PARTES
1:53 el escudo de Millonarios
U2 es *U2* , y así en su video salgan estáticos sin hacer nada seguirán siendo una de las mejores bandas!
En el 1:53 sale la 14 de Millonarios fc. Grande U2
Gracias por su música, por su arte...
Llegue aquí por supuesto porque me encanta U2 pero también por la bandera de Millonarios💙
Espetacular em demasia, não consigo aguentar a emoção.
Fuck you U2 you guys are all going to hell you try to act like you care about America your agenda is all about the people controlling the world trying to take our guns and all our freedom FUCK YOU...and this song sucks
Please Stop Making New Song!!!!!!\nThank You!!!!!!!
It's so cool when Bono hugs President Hillary Clinton.
If they put this song on my phone I hope they give us the option to delete it cause this is a big no thank you
music for old white farts.
u2 the most yankeecocksucker band in the world xd
This is not the U2 I know and cherish. This is shallow, soulless, and cheap. There's nothing unique about this. This is not U2! Where's the depth?! That poetic uniqueness they once had is gone. If you think I'm crazy for expressing this, just go listen to Zoo Station, Zooropa, MoDo, The Fly, The Unforgettable Fire, and tell me that this holds up in creativity and quality. You'll find that it doesn't hold a fucking candle! This is safe and watered down top 40 2017 garbage. It's very sad.
Glad they used the correct form of you're in the title.
Does this song come with the new iPhone x?
worst band ever
That song sucked
FUCK THESE CUNTS
no.
This song is about nyc or what? \nStuck in a moment you can't get out, New York, Gone, all because of you, City of blinding lights and now this. All for New York.
THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD IS BACK
The Edge guitar sound is Best Thing for me.\nBy the way, when are U2 will come to Japan? they came to Japan last time 11years ago..
Thanks for the preview - can't wait for the release!!
01:55 _Fuck off!_ ❓❓❓
I also love a threeway
I love a three way 🤣🤣👏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
Ok why andy feel the need to bring up Taylorswift in every interview?
I love how she didn't express the fact that she thinks they're alike in negative way. She ''praised'' both songs and didn't pit one woman against each other. I gotta admit I didn't expect that answer but I loved it. Way to go Fergie!
The song actually borrows from I'm Too Sexy.
nice way to dodge directly answering that question
Andy says, I love a 3-way. LMAO!!! I bet he does.
FERGIE is unbothered I love her.
wow she looks so gorgeous
If it was Taylor she would be sueing to the godss
I love her!
What a legend
There are only so many combinations of music. Silly pricks trying to cause some drama.
That's a great answer to that question
Isn't she a mother of a child? Hmmmmm. Great goals!
Its true after hearing Taylor Swifts new song i thought she'd joined the Black Eyed Peas lol
I thought the song sounded like Boom Boom Pow rather than My Humps.
Where is the love?......remember that deep song....what happened? Do they have charities helping others?
It amazes me how Taylor has so many people hooked on her with such mediocre vocals and basic songs.
First time I heard it I thought it was very Fergie!
I love a threeway? I bet the only threeway he had was with his dog and his TV remote control
first time I heard Taylor's song I was like this is so fergie humps
Andy: I love a threeway ... so casual.
So both songs are shite, gotcha.
Stop using Botox
Well they both took it from right said Fred - I’m to sexy.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
👌 attitude. Classy lady!
Haha ......... Silance             😂
I would suck the farts out of her baking bowl.
poor thug
Irrelevant
Taylor Swift is a tranny. I was shocked when I found out the truth.
Die of aids
This usually works better when the person being made fun of can actually laugh as well. Like the Dodi one. Some of these, it was clear people had no clue how to react and others were clearly downright embarrassed.\n\nI think the fact that they didn't show most of the reactions added to the awkwardness. After all, that's half the joke.
ah god this was good but the shane dawson part felt really awkward lmao
Will the next clip be “you tubers beating up John cozart at the streamys”?
This is truly savage
I have literally no idea who any of these people are 😐
This guy is hilarious!! Who is he?? Like a baby Neil Patrick Harrison !!
this was so satisfying to listen to.
The entertainers of the future.
Shay is history, and still got a _dis_ honorable mention.
The SHANE PART. DONT DO MY BOY LIKE THAT
1:49 hahahaha i love jon so much😂😂
Notice that nigahiga doesn't go to these things and probably wouldn't get roasted in a song like this because he represents what youtube should be about.
This is so funny, everyone seems not amused...\n\nI think Shane Dawson is the only person I watch in the entire room just because I like him as a person\n\nAnd Philly D
when he said sang about shay carl you knew it was going to be good
My Johnny boy I'm so proud
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
And this is why I love Jon! He is my fav when he posts
Some of the punchlines were awkward asf.
YouTubers have a reason to exist... without them, what else would we do on the toilet.
i literally love jon so much
I love watching mamrie's reaction when hannah gets roasted
Mamrie was so ready to fight him when he roasted Hannah and Tyler
Who was the guy at 3:46?
Did they not get the jokes or they pulling a Kevin Durant.
I like Lilly and Liza both EQUALLY!
All those people in the crowd are ______________. 🤣
Why you so mean :'( why liza? What she do to you? Whyyyy :(
You can see Ned from Buzzfeed at 1.40 😂
The fuck are those people.
This fucker is brilliant. Who is he?
this was TRAGIC in the BEST WAY
OMG watch David's reaction during the Lilly/Liza part😂 At first he's like boi don't diss my girlfriend she's talented and then when he said but now people prefer the other he nods and bites his lip and is like yeah that's my girl
the shay carl part made me oof
SORRY... but did no one notice that the try guys were there. I nearly had a heart attack. 😂
oh shit cozart is my new favourite person
Okay Jon is a host, meaning he’s alive. I now expect a video on his channel in the next month
This was the best tbh
Wow that sucked.  It was like he was saying everything i was thinking except not as funny and gayer.
WHEN HE ROASTED LIZA AND LILLY OMG IM DECEASED
this is fucking GREAT!
omg she's so ugly, it hurts to look
This diss track is better than Snake Paul.
oh my God that shay carl roast, can't believe he went there lol
PETITION FOR JON TO HOST SNL
Subbed to his channel. Get the stick out of your ass, streamy's crowd.
oh gosh Philly D was right... a couple of these people couldn't laugh at themselves. Oh well. Well done Jon!
Lol there is so much complaining on the Shane Dawson joke! It was a roast! It's not supposed to be nice! I was like Ohhh! And I laughed at the others
Only watched for that small time I got to see David dobrik
Shanaynay was actually about making fun of a white girl acting ghetto😆
“You wouldn’t wanna be me me being at the streamys” \nMe: especially not at the Shane part
i am livING FOR THIS
This might be a joke thing..but I didn't like lilly roasting...also I like Liza aswell....I m sry..I lv comedy...but I didn't like..dis..😐.dis makes me sad..dat success of a person is counted on number of views and likes...
what the fuck was that shane one jfc
I loved it so much!!!
They were good burns but no one wanted to laugh at themselves that's why it's awkward.
Let's be honest: the streamys is not a real award show and they all know it.
Mamrie is like I will fucking kill you after Jon sung the Your careers will be featured at the end memoriam part
Who are these people
If I could go I wouldn't
We all need this song to be about half an hour long
Hahahah thar was funny
oooooh that burn
FUCKING HEELL
JONNOR IS REAL
3:09 IS THAT TESSA BROOK
this shit was crony asf idc what noone say
Killed it! LOVE!
I love Jon Cozart omg 😂😂
😂😂
What a terrible crowd
Rip Liza
Roasted as fuck finally
Fucking worst side of youtube
where's papa franku?
Pretty uncomfortable
🔥🔥CALL 911🔥🔥
Lmao i love this guy
crying
Is this paint?
Liza Koshy is an improved iiSuperwomanii.
😂😂😂😂
savage
Damn shay😂
Omg

This fucker 😂😂😂
Liza koshy needs to host this
Funny and Kinda Rude
THT FREAKING SHAY CARL DISS OMG IM SHOOKITH
Does he even shave yet?
So true and so 😂 😂
Him: shaycarl \n\nMe: HAHAHAH OH SHIT
weak-ass crowd
JFC
Ouch was Shay there?
THE SHADE ON SHAY!!! IM SHOOK
this was sooo shadyyyy
That.... Was ruthless.
Get roasted. Straight fire.
This show was painful to try and sit through. I couldn't even do it. It was so awkward and just pathetically unfunny... I had to stop watching it. This host was the worst part. He's obnoxious and  he's probably one of the least funny people I had to listen to. It was a mess.
WOW you both kill it at that song at the start :D kicking those high notes!!! big hugs xx
Ectoplasm is a jelly bomb !!!!! like so Louise will see
Mama glitter brings me soo much joy, even better when its a video about lush bath bombs (:
aw, did they know ectoplasm was a jelly bomb?
Where did you buy your spooky bowl?
I don't have a bath, so devo :'(
YOU ARE AMAZING LOUISE!!!! I hope me and my friends are just like you two one day! (I'm twelve)
The green bath bomb is Lord of Misrule~
I love the videos you two do together! And yes!! Please do a video with the Christmas range from Lush! :)
You ladies make double over with laughter. Dear goodness I loved this!
For some reason I keep repeating the replay button of the start. Lolol. That dance and chant though 😂 this is Halloween, Halloween,  Halloween
I knew the water was going to be purple at the end!
The green mystery bath bomb is the lord of Misrule bath bomb!
The green bath bomb was lord of misrule as well!
After a long day, this was just perfect. Love you ladies!
I love Emma. I could watch her do demos for days.
Louise’s jumper is so cute!
Christmas Lush line range demo and collab with Emma please.
I love the couch in the background!!!
Rose Quartz is that you?
I just went to Lush today! I got a couple of Halloween bits (Pumpkin & Monsters' Ball bath bombs and Bewitched bubble bar) plus the Rocket Science bath bomb 😊.
😂😂😂😂😂 take a shot every time they say  OoooooOoooOOOOhhhhhhhhhhhhOooooo 😂😂😂😂. Louise you look amazing with black eyeshadow! 💜💜💜
that first bath bomb you tested was ectoplasmic (ayyyyyyy)
I love walking past the Lush shop. The smells rush out of the doors up my nostrils
The Magic Wand soap looks like one of those liquorice sticks with flavour inside
That green bath bomb one is Lord of Misrule 😊
Not for me that bit killed me!! Swear I'm still laughing!! I love you Louise!! Xc
Is it just me who thinks the pink one looks like a butthole😂😂
Loved this video but I have a phobia of polystyrene so the close ups and playing of that  I couldnt handle but otherwise loved it
I love your friend. She’s so funny like you😂❤️
Haha, I couldn't stop laughing at I think we've sniffed too many balls! Secretly still 12, not 26 at all. 😂
If you like earth 😂😂love you both❤️xx
Loved this video! Got the notification whilst in college and waited all day to get home and watch it! I'd love a Christmas one too!!
Obsessed with watching you two now. 😂😂😂😂
Love these types of videos!!xx
One of my favourite videos you’ve ever uploaded 🙌
I love your top Lou!!!!!
The goth fairy is Dan...
The green bath bomb was the Lord of Misrule bath bomb ❤️ I would love to see you do the Christmas range too, 2 of my favourite YouTube things is one!!! I bought most of the Halloween 🎃 and Christmas 🎄 range recently online and loved opening mine and love to see both your reactions to the Christmas 🎅🏻 range too this vid was brilliant xx
The green bathbomb is Lord of misrule - like the shower gel! And is amazing in the bath\nThe ectoplasm is a jelly bomb, it makes a layer of jelly to play with in the bath that dissolves after about 10 minutes x
Yours should definitely do a Christmas video, please do xoxox
Hi Louise yh please do a Christmas lush video x
I LOVE your hair. Hope baby glitter #2 lives pink as much as you. Lysm 💖💖
I love lush 😍❤️❣️
Oh such fun!!!! I clearly need to get me to lush!!!
bet you two went down on each other on the sofa after filming
I work for Lush and the foamy bits you got in your box - actually dissolve. If you run them under the tap they'll disappear. They're made from potato starch, so you can actually eat them....but I don't advise it! Hope you love the Halloween range <3
Louise! your eyeshadow looks amazing, what are you wearing?
You look freaking great in black please take note
Hi lewise, my mum is an ambassador for a brand called tropic that is amazing for when you're pregnant as it is so natural, she didnt ask me to say this but i just thought you would really like some of their new stuff out this season. Xx
You should post a cover of C'est La Vie
Omfg I needed this and please can you do a Christmas one xxxx😁😄😊❤😙💥
Please do a Christmas one.  And show us the known one
I feel like this video lowered my IQ
Louise the  green one you didn't know what was is the same smell and name as Liam's fav shower gel xx
Yes please to a Christmas Lush haul! 💕🎅
+ demos I THOUGHT IT SAID DEMONS :D
Ohmygod I love your hair 😍 I wish I could get that colour
the 'green mystery ball' was lord of misrule bath bomb, its in the christmas range! x
Lol as soon as you started throwing the packing foam onto the floor I thought ' you'll regret that later' and then you said it seconds later xD
I love your videos so much
Friendship goals!!💗And OMG Louise you look so beautiful😘
The green bath bomb is the Lord of Misrule bath bomb!
Hi Louise I have loved watching this video and yes please Defo a Christmas lush video would be Amazing xxx love you xxx
The mystery ball is Lord of Misrule bath bomb
I absolutely love Lush and this video was amazing :)
Love this, also love how Louise's hair matches her wall :D
I am obsessed with Emma's dress!!! Does anyone know where it's from?
Hi Louise, the first bath bomb you tested out, is in fact a jelly bath bomb, so if you had have put your hand in the tub, it would have been full of slime!!xx
Don't lick it, you're with child. 😂😂
I completely agree with Louise... Emma looks lovely with lip color on! You ladies are a hoot!
I have now just placed a rather large Lush order.. no regrets! haha <3
Louise: shall I lick it?\nEmma: no your with child\nMe:😂
Yes to a video of the whole Christmas Lush range!! 🎄
Just uploaded a new video would love if anyone could check it out! 💓💓
The ectoplasm one is supposed to be a jelly bath bomb! Meaning it should have left a kind of goopy film on the top. Did it do that? Im curious about the texture!
PLEASE DO MORE!!!!!!!!!!
YAY I LOVE EMMA

Sniff it lmao.
I suffered from acne almost 3 years. I tried a lot of products but it in the end my skin was more damaged as it was in the beginning. The only thing that helped me was aloe vera gel with a tablespoon of pure turmeric powder. Depending on the amount you need of aloe vera gel, just mix a tablespoon of turmeric powder and create a mask. The mask is vegan and cruelty free. The mask will clear your skin and make your skin glow. If you want you can use aloe vera gel afterwards to cool off your skin.
U look like a clown with all that makeup. No joke. Why do girls do this
I love this look, Carli! There are never enough colorful, beautiful makeup looks, so I'm very grateful! ❤️🐧 I'd love to see a look with some deep purples, plums, with a pop of fuschia and magenta. I think that would look amazing on you too, as always. Love you, gorgeous! 😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
Try using the brand, Acnes i love the toner and moisturizer.
Tata Harper spot treatment is AMAZING!! Her clarifying line is awesome too they have a moisturizer and mask. But if you just want a spot treatment it’s so good and works so fast :)
favorite look you've ever done!
What camera is she using ??
You should do purple! Not maroon, but straight purple
Hello!!! Just wanted to say that the eye look is simply gorgeous. As I was watching the video towards the end I thought you look like Aguilera young version. Why don't you do a makeover as her. LOVE your videos can't wait to see your new collection!
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
I would like to see a red or yellow look. Or both. Haha just watched Beauty and the beast so I'm feeling those colors. \n\nBtw I'm in awe with this look! 💕
Sunday Riley's UFO serum is sooooooooo good. You should definitely check it out! It helped my skin, even in just areas that had blackheads and stuff!
The Murad spot treatment is really good for acne!
What an inspiration   Great person
My Favorite Product For Acne Is The Effaclar-La Roshay Posay Acne Kit ! Its Seriously AMAZING & Only $30 For The Whole Kit !\nBtw, You're Soooo Beautiful ! 😭😍
Obagi is a good acne product. You should try it.
Carli Bybel, I have a question, how is your skin so healthy and bright ? You have a glow that I've been trying to achieve for years! Please please tell me what you do for healthy bright glowing skin ?? Water ?
I'd love to see a purple/mauve and cranberry color, my anniversary is in December and looking for a great evening glam look, thanks ☺
I miss your monochromatic mauve everyday/neutral looks. Would love a monochromatic peach or another mauve one! Also a super natural all skin/contour look like Kim K but with powders.
Loved it ! I'm totally going to recreate 😍🙌🏼 love ya !
You are so beautiful with out becca capri coast bronzer also, am a boy and I saw this make up transformation for the first time because I found you so beautiful.....carli bybel''''''sorry for interrupting in the girly conversations but I found you so pretty that I can't controlled to say that.....I just loved you.......and your nose is perfect :)
Omg your skin looks flawless! \nI feel like you use the Subculture palette the same way I use my Modern Renaissance palette. If used correctly they work beautiful!
Olive green eye camo style and a burgundy eye for beginners please
I recommend Paula's choice line for sensitive skin
I'd recommend using the tatcha mist when your going for a dewy look and not a matte look like you did here in this tutorial
Love that you list the products and how they're in order too. This teal eye look is gorgeous ! Thumbs up for sure 👍🏼
Beautiful! Love the teal :) can we see more looks from your Deluxe Palette?
Do a wine color or a mustard yellowish eye look ❤️
USE THE NEW HUDA !!!!! I AM OBSSESEED WITH THE BURNT ORANGE AND GLITTER COLORS
I can't tell is this is a transgender or female
I swear one thing I would love to do is get my makeup done by you. It always looks so dang flawless. Always! And your wardrobe is to die for. I just can't.
Red! Do a red look ❤️❤️
I love her so much she's a huge inspiration she's very young and successful with her business and everything else !!! I wish I had her life ! Yaaaas girl !!
love this and you :)
I love you Carli ❤️❤️❤️ you always have a way of explaining things and I just love how sincere you are!! You always make uploading videos your number one priority 💕💕😘 much love all the way from South of the border in Texas!! 😍😍
I like grease lightning by lush cosmetics for my blemish spots! Cruelty free/vegan brand, it has aloe vera, witch hazel, and tea tree oil in it and lots of other good stuff!
Good job girl...good luck on ur busy week...\n\n*I don't use makeup cuz I don't know anything and I suck at foundation...enjoy ur day🌸
you should make your next look match your glitter cat ears
What is that you don't like any thinner you won't be able to breath looks great leave it alone.😘
Correct me if Im right, but wasn't this a guy at one point?
Tea tree oil works amazing for my breakouts!!! Literally over night miracle!
Is she wearing contacts? Or is that her real eye color its so prettyy
What about like a red hot pink hmmm
Magenta with gold on the eyes would be super pretty!
Is it just me or does your voice sound different..?
Would love to see a hot pink!
Can you please put what brushes you use in the corner of the screen if you don't mention them? Thank you
I haven't seen Bret in awhile!
This is my favorite ever 😍😍
Hey Carli, could you do like a sunset eye look? I have trouble making it look right when I try it...
Wow you are absolutely stunning!! Love this look got to try this look out. =)
I just thought about another color do red !
Burgundy color to introduce fall colors please
I would love to see an Orange/gold'ish look
You have really pretty eyes...even without the make-up...but, good job! Pretty!!.  If you are not, you should become a make-up artist!!
Did Carli get a new tattoo on her finger?
¡¡¡ your nose is so beautiful and you really DON'T need a plastic surgery
Does anybody have a dupe for the 'splash' color from the glitter palette? I loooove the color but I dont want the whole palette :(
Congrats. U look like a clown now.
Murad spot treatment, Kiehl's Blue Herbal spot treatment. But if they're completely inflamed and infected I just use peroxide.
MAD acne drying solution is the best!!! The Mario one never worked for me but the MAD works so well! Love you girl 😘
So pretty do a bright pink next 💕🌷💖 and MANNY MUA SOOOOO PIGMENTED LOL  love it 😍
purple!!! <3 loveyouuu cant wait to see your new missguided collection!
Thank you for actually doing a tutorial. I miss when that was an actual thing. I've followed you for years and I have loved every second of it!
I use differin gel, the OTC one and i find that it works pretty well
So no Fenty for you huh? Stunning look!
Based on this review and this review alone, I've now finally decided I'm buying this pallet. Thanks girl 👍
YouTube: please keep inch-thick makeup videos out of the trending section. The thumbnails make me vomit every time.
Has anyone ever thought that after she puts foundation on and she has that discoloration around her lids and upper lids that it just looks like eyeshadow and she should just put a wing on a liner.
I hope you offer larger sizes this time.. It's really devastating to not find your size when you want the piece so bad..
People who ask why you don't get a nose job are so stupid. Maybe because I don't want to have my nose broken by a hammer and have tons of bruising and pain for weeks or months!!! It's a serious surgery. Very traumatic to the human body even if you are numbed during surgery. The body knows it's getting broken and cut.
The setting powder seemed to change the color of foundation. Turned it orange.
am i the only one who thinks she looks like Emilia Clarke ?
It's BEAUTIFUL!!!! arttttt
That look is gorgeous!! :)
Loved it 😍❤️
Looking gorgeous 👍
pinks or browns
Blue

Hair care routine too pleaseeeeeee!!!!
Carli you seem stressed !
Yellow! 💛💛💛
Lookin like Mrs. Potato Head
She's the most beautiful YouTuber!!😍
Gross
Here are the best acne masks, from my personal experience:\n- Aztec secrets healing clay mask\n- First aid beauty: Facial radiance intensive peel\n- Sunday riley:  Saturn Sulfur Acne Treatment Mask (this one can be a great spot treatment)\n\nI've tried sooooo many different products, haven't found the perfect acne cleanser yet (Kate Somerville's is okay), but these masks are great.
Gotti played by a homo? \nThat seems disrespectful.
Looks terrible. And it's not because it has HBO on it. I can't take john travolta seriously. HBO has main some great stuff. But this.. no thanks
John travolta looks 95 or maybe is dead and that’s an alien
Fuck I hope this turns out great
fuck ya! I'm legit excited for this!
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Great film. Already know it. Hopefully as good as Blackmass
My baby spencer lofranco on the big screen ,hell yee ima watch this😍
Is gotti going to blow a guy in a 737?
I'm a 93 kid from Southern California. I am sincerely curious if this is accurate.
Gotti was always smiling, he was a nut! Doesn't look like Travolta is capturing the whole point of johnny
Damn, is this movie going to be four hours long or something?
I cant take this guy seriously
Travolta's support of the Cult of Scientology, made me instantly not care about this motion picture.
I basically saw the whole movie already, genius marketing
THE MOB , LA MAFIA , THE GAMBINO FAMILY ,  WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK IN A MOBSTER MOVIE  !!!!!!!!!!!!
Came here expecting to here Travolta talk like Vinny Barbarino and am actually pleasantly surprised at his acting. I will watch this.
Finally a Travolta movie I wanna watch since his early movie rolls like face-off
Why remake the movie gotti.. I like the original just the way it is
i heard there is a scene where he goes to health spa, and grabs a male masseurs penis. which J.T. played naturally.
I hope he does a Grease lightning skit on the karaoke in one of the bars!
Movie sounds great.. but... Travolta the nutcase scientologist as Gottii??? really? ick..  Shit that is like Cruise doing the Jack Reacher movies.. Reacher is 6 foot 4 and very muscular.... Cruise is 5 foot 2 and puny, and a .scientologist... Sad...  Damn scientologists are buying their way into all the big screen movies. They are not a church but a cult and the government should do something to stop them quickly.
Will your be the very first John Trovalta I every watch? Meh maybe on when it's on Netflix.
Seems pretty glorifying, but we'll see
It's Cartels running the show
I am so watching this!!!!!
It looks like a new trailer to the old HBO movie. Im still looking forward to it but I was kinda surprised how much it reminded me of the old movie.
guna be a terrible movie. but i'm in! lol
I like the famous jay-z line, I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti.
I thought this was about the meme....
Holy shit they actually made this?!?! I remember readying about this ~6 years ago, and after a while, I figured they abandoned it
This is going straight to netflix
Travolta as a mobster.   I thought the mob frowned on gaybos?
THEY WERE FILMING THIS OUTSIDE MY HOUSE LIKE FIVE MONTHS AGO
Travolta as gotti ? It's gonna suck vinny bobarino was his best role
Is Leah Gotti gonna be in this? Pls.
Lionsgate Movies - FYI the final scene of this trailer sort of spoils the ending
Oddly enough the thumb pic for this vid was taken at John Travolta's sons funeral.
John Travolta is a great actor.  He melts into the character he plays.
White people glorify killers and murderers,  and have the audacity to say that they need peace  in their country! Smh.
I really like the original HBO gotti movie I wouldn’t mind watching this one but doubt it’s gonna be better than the original one .plus it took them like 10 years to release this movie !!
Looks interesting but there were some cheesy lines. Did he really shout THAT'S A DAMN LIE! in court? If not, then what the fuck are you doing?\n\nMusic at the beginning is cheap.
As a fan of gangster films, Gotti's story is like Al Capone's .... BORING!! It's been told in tv, books, and the movie is going to make him larger than he actually was! Want a story to tell ? Read the book,  Double Cross, the story of Sam Mooney Giancana, the boss of the Chicago Outfit. Or Mr. Untouchable, the story of Leroy Nicky Barnes. I'm just sayin'.
I remember the TV movies
Am I the only one who actually wants to watch it?...... eventually?
This showed the whole movie
This should’ve been a documentary about the deez nutz guy
Hell yea.. these are my tope of movies, Cant wait!
Looks pretty legit and factual to me!  Looking forward to this movie!
Travolta is a master at doing accents.
Its about time! This movie was supposed to be made several years ago
John looks like Arnold schwarzenegger man
I love mob movies!!!\nAlways been fascinated with that lifestyle...dont know why. Love reading about it.
Look what sodomy and Ron L. Hubbard has done to Barbarino's face!
This filming crew had the worst harstylist ever.
I'm not gonna lie \n\nthis movie looks amazing \nhopefully I'm not wrong
Apparently john gotti got his ass kicked in jail by the aryans I thought mafias were feared in Jail.
Reminds me a lot of American Gangster, that movie was too good. Gotti has potential no doubt but no way it tops American Gangster. IMO that film is up there with Godfathers and Goodfellas
This mf ain't no boss
Do ya know what day call a quarter pounder with cheese inna Paris?
you are now free to remove your wigs and be gay
Hey!! John Gotti looks like a bad impersonation of Robert Shapiro. \nTravolta...you have money. Find a good make-up artist.
Looks like the Scientology buzz timeline is over.  Don't understand why anyone would watch any movie he's attached with, literally responsible for the pain and suffering of thousands.
This looks like bullshit .... Armand Assante already did Gotti the best .. this fool looks like he did in that OJ series lol
HBO only probably produces gold
Gotti >>> John Wick
Looks like a poundland Goodfellas
Another movie that will suck.
Armand assante did it better
Gangs are dogshit. Stop glorifying them
Date Mike PT 2?
Gotti all though ur body lol
*HA GOTTI*
DEEZ NUTS....HA!...GOTTI!
Mafia scum cowards
Lol lol noooooooooooooo😅😆😆😆😆😆😆no lol lol nooooooooo
Full Video\nhttp://bit.ly/2xHsl6a
Keep mafia movies alive
The dangerous. The ruthless. Jan Gorthi.
Wouldve been really good except 2 words = John travolta.
Lmao this trailer is horribly made
Don Carlo Gambino da fif
FINALLY
Something tells me Travolta gonna try too hard...
looks like shit tbh, would rather watch sopranos rerun
Interesting 💙
New godfather?
I want the gabbagool
Uuggh travota.  No
Disgrace
HHAAA GOTTIM
HA...GOTTI!!
Good GTA story
*DEEZ* *NUTS* *GOTTI* \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsorry
Gotti' em\n(hehe)
John Gotti, JOHN GROTTI
*hits blunt*
ايه ده كل الفيلم قتل حرام عليكم كده
Deez nutz.. HAH! GOTTI!!
The HBO one wasn’t that bad...
Ben is such a control freak he is trying so hard not to interfere haha
I love cooking for friends and fam. But not when I’m by myself... Please do a video (or two) about recipes for one. Not too many ingredients and leftover food would be great too! #happysingle :)
What bigger than the observable universe?\n\n\n\n\nBen's silicone bakeware collection
still standing with my vvery first comment on sorted: I LOVE when Ben only instructs and the others do stuff.. It makes me more inclined to think I can do it than when Ben cooks. Because.... chef and such.
DAMN!!! That is impressive! I love the addition of the apricots! I bet that came out amazing!
jamie would have probably gotten 10/10 if he would have taken the pork out of the pan RIGHT when ben said it
You should have called this video Jamie and Ben get stoned with apricots.\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube guidelines workers: MONETISED BITCH.
more midweek!
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
look like to much work. Delivery much easier 😃
Never thought of apricot with pork but it sounds delicious. Too bad it's 11:30pm where I'm at, watching, or I'd cook this right away. I'm not sure my family would appreciate my midnight cooking 😂
Hahhaha is the last line + Sorted the chef's right? :P good work boys
Jamie is cute. 😀 he's my fave
4:36 Thank you, Ben. I now know the easiest way to get stoned.
Do more of these!
still can't get behind the whole 'meat+fruit' thing.
I'm allergic to a lot of fruits, many which are stone fruits. What other alternatives could I use? (Apples and pears are not an options either!)
Running out of inspiration ...??? I don't understand what you're saying. You make thousands of meals in your lifetime. Why would it being the middle of the week make any kind of difference to anything??? I don't understand. ???
Unfortunately I can't eat pork (religious reasons). Is there a protein I can substitute in for this meal? I really like the flavors used in here. Beans and fruits etc.
He didn't salt/pepper both sides I think D:
You guys should make poulet-frites. Basically rotisserie chicken with a bed of potato/fries underneath to catch the fat drippings and other deliciousness from the chicken
How do you get the smell of garlic out of ur hands
Don't worry Ben, I can give you the other half an inch.\n\n*sorry, it was sitting out there*
I was having a mild panic attack when I thought they were not going to add back the accumulated juices form them resting pork.
what would be a good substitute for prunes?
Can not believe the amount of 'je ne sais quoi' you shoved in there...
guys if you want to eat healthy and save money delete Food app from your phone
Could we do a student meal week please? like quick and easy meals for one that are also healthy-ish and cheap? :)
Do a segment of different kinds if food from ancient times please!!!
This is great, definitely going to try this out. Would love to see more!
Why are there bits of dead animal in your dish 😕?
Haha The zooming in on the food reminds me of Gordon Ramsey!!\n\n\n\n\nWHERE'S THE LAMB SAAAAAAUAUUAUUAUACE
So easy thumb in the middle Stoned.. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh
This reminded me I've got lamb cutlets in the freezer, excellent.\nWell done Jamie.
3:55 Jamie had the tongs in his left hand but he still used his other hand to put the pork into the pan...\n\n\nI love it XD!
I seriously think that Ben's idea of quick and easy means you don't have to grind your own wheat for the flour.
Is anyone going to tell Ben that apples don’t have stones?
I love the look on Jamie's face when he gets to do the This is our........sorted!. That's the joy of cooking right there.
You guys should do more mid week meals, love this!
Love the one pan recipes! I'm gonna try this one next week
I knew it. I knew no matter what, Ben wouldn't have given a 10/10. That look on his face though, was priceless.
He looked so happy to be able to say the 'sorted' line, awww! <3 lmao
dried apricots have a different flavor to fresh ones though . . .
Jamie lost some weight, looking good bro 😎👌
More of these, please!! 😘
Man, I was right there with you guys until you went to #PruneTown. 😂😂😂
OK, random challenge idea. The normal people cook and the chefs judge, but the chef's do not know what the secret ingredient/inspiration is.  This way the normies have to come up with (probably with viewer help) an inspired recipe that they make and the chefs have to figure out what the inspiration was based off the dishes. A  challenge all around.
i dislike the meals that people do with pork because i don’t like fruit in savoury meals very much
This was great. Can we have more like this? I don't like sweets very much and I feel like there's been sooooo many desserts on this channel lately haha.
Are prunes needed to Chef all over the place?
They are so attractive!!! Single?
How is Jamie still so useless 😂
Make a series called mid-week meals! Seriously need more of such recipes for my own mid-week meals
I still watch most of the videos on this channel, even though I am a very picky eater and find a good 85% of the recipes disgusting. The boys are so entertaining, and even if I don't like a recipe (eg, fruit paired with meat.. NOPE!), I still get ideas from recipes and incorporate them into my own cooking. <3 you guys!
Ben was on fire today!
Amazing, thanks! But can get a super fight with a lot of beautiful men, please. Like have Tom Daley again and his hubby Lance Black and form two teams, like for Halloween!!!!? Because that will be Epic!!!! Please!!!!
need more of these types of vids :D\nnice and easy meals but still gorgeous
I love recipes like this! Is it possible to see some more autumnal recipes that can be slow-cooked? I work most of the day, so I'd love to come home and have something ready and waiting for me!
The missing half a point for full marks was obviously a sprig of mint
Dämn that music, anyone know what the tracks are on this one? <3
Watching these kind of videos remind me what a good teacher Ben is. If I was in his place I'd get frustrated and do everything myself haha
Any reason you haven't used the reverse sear method for steak/pork chop recipes?
Who complains because of fat meat?? Freaks.
looks like i m going to Nando's
Love this midweek recipe! It's so useful😁. More please🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I had a mini heart attack when Jamie put the rested medallions back in the pan without the collected resting juices. I thought they were going down the sink. Thankfully Ben saved the day! Phew!
Can you please do some VEGAN dishes without peanut products.  Thank You.   Have a wonderful day.  Cheers.!
The minus half was for not taking the pork out as soon as he was told! XP
Ben cannot help himself from helping Jamie
ready for stock pot meals this winter
Ben's response to Jamie not taking out the pork fast enough personifies my inner emotions when I get asked stupid questions. Thank you Ben.
That looks AMAZING!
wher frome you hawe guys that big pork filet or that was pork loin
Hey sorted food names Noah and I am a second year uni student at UWE and my cooking skills are pretty bad.Do you have any student recipies they are easy enough but time effective that anyone could cook them as a tea.Great video wish I could cook this
This is so encouraging to see and holy heck it looks delicious!
Who the hell thinks destoning apricots is difficult? 😅
I just bought a slow cooker - can you do a week of slow cooker meals please guys? Thanks so much!! :D
James looks so proud at the end 😂😂
More videos like this!! Please:D This looks sooooo good and easy <3
Thanks for the recipe, very interesting you guys!
I'm a vegetarian why am I watching this?
Jamie should have put a sprig of mint on it to get a 10/10
Jaimie did the thing Jaimie did the thing!!
Bens vocabulary: Amazing, hot, gentle, succulent, British
More one pot recipes
Porking? Was that a Freudian slip, Ben? Lol!
Stoned! 😍
Reminds me of medieval cuisine!
Yaaaaaay midweek meals
6:14 SAME
What about tinned fruit
Do you guys do any vegetarian meals?
Sorry, but pork is not the same health-wise as chicken breast! Pork has a substance in it that stimulates inflammation! I'm not gonna go into it, simply because I don't want to translate everything into English. But just know that pork is BY FAR less healthy than chicken, no matter how little fat the piece you eat contains!
Could I substitute the pork with those big mushrooms and chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegan?
A video on delicious pork during Navratri..........!!! Ughhh when will these 2 more days end!! Not that I can have pork, but some Chicken would be nice!!! 🍗🍕🌭🍖🍳
Why is it chicken stock is always paired with pork when we normally use matching meat/stocks (ie chicken with chicken stock, beef with beef stock). Is pork stock just not a thing?
I like these effortless midweek meals. Can we have more of them?
More mid-week meals please! \o/\o/\o/
you didn't cook out the flour. is it still alright?
Could you use any other meat?
Hey....HEY MAN, nice shirt.\n\nedit: the thumbnail for this video looks like a weiner
I wish I could be there to see all that anal sex going on at the neighbors house. Full homo, have fun.
This guy reminds me of the older twin from the Sandlot
I honestly thought this was a uncut penis
I hate it when people ask for likes and subscribers...\n\n\n\n\nSIKE NI🅱🅱A, YOU THOUGT!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe!
You need oil to make chips
Hey brodie how can i get a cattoo please i need it because my parents wont let me get a real tattoo but the cattoo will be so awesome itll probably convince them i hope im 20 but i respect my parents decision, \n\n-best\n\nBruno
Can a laser cut glass?
For a video idea you should clean your house and see the weird stuff you find
Also, this is the most successful food lazed vid so far 😂👌🏽 much improved haha
You gotta have bugs by now
The cat tattoo looks like it’s poking out of your pants.
Cook eggs with the laser. Any type scrambled, sunny side up etc.
that's s potato dick
I hate going to the barber.. can you make a machine to cut my hair for me??
I believe that is a penis in the thumbnail.
you should try to cut something with water
What about laser cut fish (cooked)
Where to get cool cat shirts like you
Aw that's so nice that you're friends (or at least friendly) with your neighbors! Also am very jealous of you getting to live next door to so many nice-looking and half-naked men.
What wattage laser do you use and where did you get it?
You guys live like filthy animals. \n\nLove it
Why does some parts remind me off how to basic
You should make a laser cut food joint. like if you agree
HEY WILLIAM!!! YOUR THUMBNAIL LOOKS LIKE A DICK AND I HATE IT!!! YOUR DICKTATO NIGHTMARE THUMBNAIL GAVE ME ACNE!!! I'LL NEVER SLEEP PEACEFULLY AGAIN!!
Can you cut your hair with the laser???
I mean it's a great tool to just cut the potatoes and then fry them. You can get a wafer thin chip and promptly explode after...
How did human garbage get s shot at YouTube... ?
Use the laser to cut brownies into shapes
In the same now it looks like a dick
I can count to potato! Trust me it's hard.
I enjoyed this way too much 😂😂
your shirt look like my cat when he eats potato chips  on the couch thats why he has a nick name *counch potato*
No... didn't watch the video just know it's not
The video pic at first looked like a penis ...did anyone think the same?
Like this for William to clean his build area
Can you cook eggs with a laser
why is your house full of shirtless dudes?
How to basic's lost twin
Can you cut cheese? I promise it isn't for the joke, I just want to see you cut cheese.
This is like how to basic, but with lasers, and a face
You should make a play button with the laser. As for the material it should be something stupid like dry ice. But that may create problems so I guess cardboard/styrofoam would work
The only thing phatter than his shirt is my dad

Lol the video got demonitized, I wonder why? (Looks at thumbnail)
And I thought that was a picture of poopi Goldberg,s transgender wee wee.
Am I the only one that clicked on this video coz the thumbnail says,It's a potato 😐
Where is the penis I was promised?
That thumbnail looks like a penis
I love the determination you have that keeps you trying to make food on the laser cutter despite countless failures
Awesome! You should do something floating with magnets. That's all I got, but yeah do it
The third neighbor looks exactly like shayne from smosh

He looks like h3h3 productions
Ten bucks says this guy is  not married ;)

William Osman is a probably a child molesting pederast
I saw a crinkly yellow penis in the thumbnail. The only reason I clicked on the video was so I could say so in the comments section. I didn't even bother to watch the video.
Needs to change this channel's name to That annoying dumbass guy.
Annoying white guy
Make a new series Will it Lazer its where you lazer weird things that wouldn't require a full video by itself. so it would be you lazer like 3 things in a video and see what happens
That guy lives in a pig stein
Hey will, big fan! Quick question: have you ever done something that hasn't been a complete failure?
The lighting on this video is a dream. You look gorgeous, pregnancy suits you. <3
Totally impressive. ^.^
Love this! Would totally recommend the new Clarins cushion foundation too! The perfect finish, buildable coverage (big deal for something with problem skin like me!) and just feels beautiful on the skin! x
Ooh what nail polish are you wearing??
Can’t wait for your little one to come !!
Love you Fleur! It was you that I started watching YouTube because of. Hope you're feeling well xxx
thumbs up hun 🤗 x
<3
❤️❤️❤️
💕💕
Hello
I enjoy your videos SO MUCH😍
Will you ever come to Slovenia? 😊
Nice nails
That perfume bottle was cute
Some great favs! xxx
That brown eyeliner really makes your green eyes stand out. So gorgeous!
Yay! I love favourites videos <3 :)
😍😍
You are so lovely and down-to-earth 😍 Pregnancy really suits you. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
the lighting in this video is superb and it only augments your beauty, mademoiselle.
Are all the Estée Lauder eyeliners that good or just the Victoria Beckham ones???
Oooo I wanna try the new Elizabeth and James Perfume , I have two but I can't get it anywhere near me :-(
You're so beautiful Fleur! x
Loving your nail polish, what is it?? ☺️
Love this video Fleur! Does anyone happen to know when the Estée Lauder BB Cushion will be available in Canada? Or if it's called something else here?
thyanks for thoughts on the new Elizabeth and James launches.  Nirvana Rose is still my firm favorite, but the whole line is incredible.  It was nice to hear your thoughts on the new ones.
I need to know what this lip color is!
Short and sweet are my ❤️
Your nail polish ! 🙌🏼 what is it???
I love your makeup look it's so simple and your eyes go really well with that lip colourrrr
Fleur, how much money would it take for you to get gang banged by a wild pack of AIDS infested niggers in front of a camera? I can fly you out to Tel Aviv at a moments notice and money is no object. \n\nCheck your DMs.
Keep well.  Thanks for the video.
I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.
I love your earrings Fleur! Where did you get them? Can I find them online? I would really appreciate it if you could answer me :)
You looks so pretty as always thanks babe
Yours are the only favourites video I watch, love them! What are you wearing through your brows? They look more defined yet softer if that even makes sense ..?
Love this. So excited for mini de force! Thank you for inspiring me to upload my first video X
Hi Fleur! What lip color are you wearing??
Hi fleur love your monthly favourites videos.would love to try the purfume.as always you look fab.xx😀
Estee Lauder is always wonderful! I love their products ❤️✨
Hello Fleur, your reviews are immensely helpful for the beauty/youtube world. You are gorgeous and I've loved your channel for a while. xo
Literally cannot remember the last time I filmed a faves. You look great Fleur xxx
Your makeup always looks incredible!!! 😍👌🏻 As do your nails! You always have the prettiest colors on!!
I really really love this British accent, I want to speak like this, but I caaan't it's don't matching with my mouth 😂😩
Love that scent! Smells a lot like another favorite of mine, Aerin's Amber Musk (which I think I pick up after you recommended it in a video??)
Also obsessed with the new Perfume from E&J it is smokey perfection
❤️❤️❤️ you're so sweet and so pretty!   I'm obsessed with creamy smooth eyeliners. It's so much easier to glide on
Need to check some of these out
I knew the cushion foundation would make it in your favourites, I really want to try it xx
By Terry has been on my list for ages but I can never justify the purchase when there are less expensive items I like...Though, I'm sure I'd love whatever I got and never look back!
Who was here before 500views
I'm just excited for the new in October video:DD
Great products! I'm definitely going to try the concealer and the hair spray. Thanks a lot :)P. S. You look absolutely amazing as always.
Perfect timing for the train journey home! That Estee BB cushion is on my list!! Xx
Said this before but love your favourite videos and also your eyebrows look so good!!
Hi Fleur, will you be going vlogtober or vlogmas at all this year? Just curious I love your videos 😊
What about your sweater? 😊
Fleur you're so gorgeous in every video 💕
Perfect lip color 🔥
Just now commenting. But as always STOP WHATEVER YOUR DOING AND WATCH. My most intrigued item on this video is the new Elizabeth and James scent. I definitely didn't care for it too much when I first smelt it but I guess I should give it another try since Fleur recommends it. Love you always.
Can anyone explain to me what the point of the cushion in the foundation is? Is it just a gimmick or what. I got the L'Oréal one and it's useless.
I went to purchase the concealer but confused by the colours. Have you seen the other 2 lighter colours Fleur? I usually have the lightest shade in concealers, as I'm very fair but on Really Rees review the swatches came up looking really pink for 1, and really orange for 2. Your one at no 3 looks really light and more natural looking, is it at all orangey? Kate x
You look absolutely beautiful dahhhling!
I absolutely love these videos! Although I'm sure I say that about all videos you make😂 love you lots Fleur xxx❤️❤️❤️
Which of the Elizabeth & James fragrances do you not like? Besides the French Grey....I find that you and I have similar taste in fragrance.... I haven't tried the amethyst one yet.... but I LOVE Bourbon
Evo do the best blonde toning conditioner - I find that most purple/silver shampoos are a bit drying, but the conditioner is amazing and tones more than any shampoo I've tried!
Need daily vlog...fluer...missing everyone 😍😘😁
your make up is beautiful :)
What's the point in making the elizabeth and james perfumes exclusive to harrods? So you can only get it if you live in london or visit london? And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now. We're talking about mary kate and ashley here, they need to get their heads out of their arses.
Hi Fleur would you consider doing  a video on your eyebrow routine?  They always good. Thanks.
I'm seriously thinking about trying that cushion if they make a shade light enough for me. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Summer xo
No matter where I am, I always feel at home when watching Fleur's videos 💕
I found E&J fragrances in Fenwick as well.
Whats on ur nails? Have been seeing this a lot on ur videos! Thanks!
The by Terri blush looks lovely, but I can get over the fact that it looks like a nipple in the compact 🤦🏼‍♀️
👍❤️good favourites & I loved it a lot
In general I like your videos, but I really do not like the way you use affiliate links and not marking them as affiliate links. And I find it quite strange that you link to two Estee Lauder products to two different websites instead of just linking to Estee Lauders page, its obvious that its because of rstyle.me. Its so sad, because you do this in every video and it almost feel like youre not being candid to your viewers. I hope you change the way you do the info bar in the future :)
Is that Elizabeth & James perfume really that good? Like is it really earth-shakingly good GOOOOOOD? Lots of people are raving about it like a bitch in heat. Lol
Come on Chelsea!! We won against Atletiko!!!😆😆
Love it! But Hazard would were amazing too, he's a tekker

Maybe if you didn't have a stuttering problem and Tourette's at the same time you could get a job.
It's a little unnerving people don't realize this is really unprofessional. This falls just short of interviewing as a team in the movie step brothers. What is this the black bill and ted haha.

AYEEEEEEE It's Lit!
I like your instagram feed, with both (your mirror selfies and your professional pictures) especially the one's when you're sitting on stairs and in front of coffee shops👌👌👌👌💥✨
Hi Sami, thanks for this video, it is so useful. About your question re. Instagram, what I can say is I'm bored with perfect looking pictures from a lot of accounts I see. So go for less perfect pictures. So many Youtubers' accounts are boring now because they're all so perfect and shot professionally that they all look identical, and I delete more and more (or not follow) when I see an account that looks just like the others. I hope this helps. I'm 5,2 so it's always interesting to see what you wear and what could suit me too, as a 'petite' person.
love your look today. those earring are bomb. fashion videos are the best
Does anyone really just wear what's in 'fashion'? Personally i don't care if something is or trend or not. I wear what i like and feel comfy in. Docs literally never go out of style. I had my first pair aged 8 and am now 34. I have 3 pairs and they're practically all I wear. Screw fashion. Wear whatever you want.
I really like that this video wasn't just about buying loads of new stuff 🙌
Hey Samantha, if you're worried about the oversized bomber trend not suiting your short frame (same tbh) Ariana Grande has been known to wear them from time to time and she is next level tiny! You may have already seen it since it's a little old now but check out her music video for Everyday for some inspo. Not a plug but shorties like us can definitely pull off all the trends too!
always enjoy your fashion videos :) I like both types of instagram pics - I think it's good to have some of both as it keeps it looking sophisticated but real
Hi Sam, personally I like a mix of professional shots and mirror pics, but I also like whatever gets us more outfit pictures!
I don't know what it is about this video, but I LOVED it ❤️ I feel like you're the one fashion YouTuber I watch who is so passionate when you talk about fashion - such a joy to watch!
I bought a bright red scarf yesterday and I am in love! Such a good way to get a bit of colour for someone who's scared of deviating from monochrome!
Hey Sam, sorry just seen Jason uploaded a podcasts with you.. I'll be back ☝️😊
As for Instagram I really like a good mix of both !!
Love your style !!! You are such an inspiration
I love the top you're wearing with the red lipstick! Selfies, and mirror outfit pics are my favorites for your Instagram because it feels more real.
Love you sammi! I always love your fashion videos
Shout out to everyone that remembers Sam killing it in Doc Martens back in the day.
a video on the styling pajama trend..
Yes the check blazer! I picked up the perfect one for 1 pound whilst thrift shopping !
I think the Docs could look good with the chunky jumper and sweet skirt combo
You look so pretty  on your outfit with red lipstick 😊👍
These type of videos are just my favourite.  I love how accessible you make all the trends.  You give such good inspiration to try and explore different looks.
i love how you've made these trends so accessible, great video!
mix of both type of pics!
a major trend for this winter and all the following seasons is ethical fashion :)
This red lip looks so good!
Hi Sammi Loving this video! The part about you having to switch out an item because your'e shorter is SO relatable and made me want more content like this! Can you do a video of outfit/trends for different body types? Petite, tall, plus, etc. This would help others make the best choices for their body type! Sending lots of love and hugs your way from California!
love it. watched this on my way to london.. eeeeexcellent. i will never be onboard with kitten heels I'm afraid. they just offend me lolllll.\np.s. im a fan of the professional, more candid photos on your insta purely because i can see an outfit in action that way.\nlots of love xo
yes omg return of the og sammi bring out the docs girl <3 hehe xxx
Sam you should do a thrifting/charity video. I would LOVE that from you
I prefer a mix between relatable (mirror pics) and professional ones x
I enjoy the mirror shots less professionals!👍
You could instagram a picture of a rock id still think its a stylish rock and looks better than my outfit
where is that pink skirt from??? its to die for!!!
Yes Sammi I remember your Dr. Marten/Creepers phase!! xx
i love the look of the oversized jackets, but i'm not sure how to style them. i have a very oversized teddy bear style jacket which i love, but i feel a bit goofy wearing it cause it's srsly massive! i like a mixture of professional photos and mirror photos. i guess mirror photos make you more relatable because not everyone has someone around to take professional photos of them.
I love when you do videos like this Sam! Love it!
So tempted by the Novem & Knight grey jumper. But I want to feel the fabric before buying and I don't like paying for postage/returns when I can't be sure on the quality/how it washes, etc. Anyone reading this written a review/seen a video/made one? I haven't seen many
Your fashion is life lets be fair
You look so natural when you speak in front of a camera, you give me the impression of a friend speaking to me and giving me advices, I love it!!
This was so helpful!
loved this video! would love to see more fashion vids like this especially showing catwalk trends and ideas off the highstreet
Its a nice way for retail industries to market and sell more and more of their products to make us feel whats in trend and whats not,.... constantly season after season.. year after year... otherwise people won't feel the need to  constantly keep buying clothes.... oh the vicious cycle of consumerism ...is never ending.... and in these you tube channels we are given inspiration to buy more clothes....
Yess I'm obsessed with red, checks and kitten heels! Trying to save but ffffff it😂🙈
I love your earrings, they're gorge! I almost thought your fly was down too, LOL! Those kitten heels are hot...gotta get me a pair.
Sammy you're just so beautiful!! 😍😍😍
Love love love you're always killing the style videos and posts! Xxx
I really enjoy more casual outfit posts on Instagram with tags of where to find the items! Still love seeing your professional shots on the blog though!
Post whatever you're feeling the most passion for that day!!
Really good video. I can tell you love filming it and you came super prepared. Awesome.
Gurl I live for these videos! They are so helpful and your style ideas are always on point! My favourite out of all of them is the trend of red and can never go wrong with an oversized jumper! Loved it! xx
I loveeee this video! Seriously so helpful and I always love your outfits and just your style in general. 💖💖💖😍😍😍
You should try GANNI's Julliard mohair jumper in red!! It is so beautiful and it would really suit you ❤️
There's a red jumper from Monki on ASOS that would be fab!
Like before watch it! Sammy you're my inspiration!
I LOVE YOUR FASHION VIDEOS!!!!! 💕💕💕💕 there my absolute fave!! You inspire me so much! If I'm ever stuck on what to wear I watch all your old fashion videos and lookbooks! 😌 love you sam 😊😊💕
Love these videos make them more!!!
Loved the video, with the different shots and images in it, made it really interesting to watch! Where is the gorgeous dark red floral wrap dress that you had on about halfway through the video from? Can’t see it in the links in the description box 😞 xx
I also think Baker boy hats, berets and statement earrings are coming back 😍 can’t complain!!
You should do a thrift shop haul!
For me personally the whole point of blogging/instagramming etc is that it's relatable and reliable/a trust-worthy, unbiased source of info. If I wanted a professional, polished piece of art I'd go and buy Vogue or something. My point being, as long as the pictures are of a decent quality (which iPhone cameras are) and you can get an angle that you can see everything clearly, just keep it simple! Everything has become too complicated and in my opinion lost sight of what made it great in the first place.
Your earrings are beautiful! You look so good, the earrings really complement your face ❤
Glad to see you happy and chatty xxx
Casual mirror pics
Piece piece piece piece piece cool  piece piece
LOVVVEEEE your style!!❤️
You looking nice ❤️
i prefer your non-professional pics on insta
I loveee the winter maxi/midi dresses
Your makeup looks great!!
Your eyebrows be poppin
Prefer selfie mirror instagram, more natural look xx
Omg those ASOS earrings are so good
Please keep doing fashion videos!!!!!
😘💕💕💕
mirror pictures
Omg those earrings 😍😍
I really like how you don't talk only about designer clothes for a change. Even though we all know you own and wear designer clothes and bags you don't stress it every time in your videos. Thank you for keeping it real xxx
My head was screaming Zara!!! You can find the red jumper in Zara!! 😂 xx
I'll say it.. I'm obsessed with your videos. Fav YouTuber!  As you asked, all of your pics are lovely but I do think your selfie pictures it feel a touch more personal.
L❤ve your makeup look🔥 on this video!
P.S. They have a gorgeous red jumper in zara ATM
i was actually feeling so bummed before watching this but now im just excited to go spend all my shhmoney on these trends. And both styles of insta pictures are nice girl xx
LOVE this type of video!!! your style is amazing
I think you'd really like the Bella Freud 1970 red jumper x
Hello, \nWe have this brand in france which si good quality\nhttp://www.comptoirdescotonniers.co.uk/100--wool-roll-neck-jumper-DACHEVILLE_3526.html#start=1\nThanks from Nice south of france
Love the sequin jacket! - Your kitten heel shoes are too cute!
I love all if it. So helpful!!
I love that kind of videos!!! You look amazing! ps. An amazing red jumper is available in h&m... you definitely should try it! ;p
I prefer the sefies. They look more real, if that makes any sense :)
I love the selfie / mirror pictures! Makes it look more realistic and I can better relate :) xx
Ok now i'm feeling the need to shop🙃.
KITTEN VEEL VERSION oh my god a died Sam 😹😹😹
Mirror selfie outfit pictures!
Mirror/selfie pictures
Pieces has a really nice red jumper (which is also quite affordable)!!
I just feel like I can't wear red clothing as I have ginger hair :( . I love anything tailored I want to mature my wardrobe as I'm 26 now and always wearing jeans and band t shirts doesn't always work when people think I'm 18/19 years old 😂👍💩
LOVE your videos! This was awesome!
Its super interesting to see other peoples takes on certain fashion trends because lately I feel like everyone just jumps on a trend and they all become carbon copies of each other!
Look at Ariana grande she's short too and she rocks the oversized bomber jacket. Sure you'll rock it too!!!!😘
I think I like a mixture of both professional and self-taken mirror ones, but sort of leaning more towards the mirror selfies. I think I like the more relaxed, relatable vibe from them. Like the one you took in front of the mirror when you were back from vacation, I think wearing a red silk shirt -  really loved that photo! But I wouldn't get rid of the professional ones altogether I don't think
#9 on trending? Hey I don’t mind if people want to see us playing decent football for once
#9 on trending😱😱😱
Thank you Ipswich! Brightened up my day!
What a performace.
O M actual G, holy shitballs how is this trending
mountain was renamed in honour of Barack Obama.\nMount Obamas height is 1318 feet.\nNot 1317 or 1319 but 1318 feet.\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nMount Obama sits opposite Christian valley or you could say it opposes it.\n\nThe Lord obviously wants believers aware Obama is the Antichrist, combined with the word of God id say this is rock solid proof\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z1jzO_cYb_U\n\n\nRevelation 13:18\n \nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nRevelation 7:4\n\nAnd I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.\n\nWhilst doing some research on #antichristobama i was amazed to find the following calculation.\n\nWe know Obama was born on August the 4th which is the 216th day of the year.\n\nIf we take the 144000 witnesses who will be Obamas worst enemies on the earth besides the 2 witnesses and divide the 144000 by  216 it works out at\n666.666666666\nSo thats FOUR sets of 666 if ever there was a doubt.\nOr\nDivide 144000 by 666 which works out at 216.216216216\n\nSo many pointers to Obama being Mr Lightning from Heaven.\n\n\nBARACK BUSTED IN REVELATION 13:18\n[url]https://youtu.be/8fNSR7yAIvo[/url]
How come the ground is so empty 😂😂😂😂
Goals are like potato chips. One is never enough.

This is 15th on trending
3º Goooaaaaaal Yes! Incredible!!! Ipswich Run to 1º
Sunderland is a joke of a club. Goodbye Sunderland , being in the premiere league is history for you guys. You guys will never make it back. Oh and BTW, I'm a man u fan and I miss the guaranteed 6points every season. Anyway seems like crystal palace will be more than happy to hand out this service.
Sunderland fans 10, Ipswich fans 1. SAFC were thrashed 5-2 but the away end sang for 90 minutes. Never experienced such a lame home crowd. It's like they're in the waiting room at the doctors – until they score the fifth! Aldershot would make more noise away at Carlisle.

OMG #39 on trending!!!
Hi
50 in beats by dre???😮😮😮\nDidnt think i'd see it
I wish I could get signed to G-Unit.
Last real gangsta and rapper connected to history
Ebro u not even black u can't stop people from meeting with Trump u idiot
50 cent is the man.\nHe got the sole blame for bringing hip hop apart.\nEbro is hating when he doesn't realise that he is just giving 50 more credit in the culture.
Got a sincerity, humbleness, and intelligence that most other rappers lack
I said the exact same thing about Donald Trump before you win the presidency the presidency was not his main goal it was build his profile
Peace to everybody who think Ebros a bitch boy
Love and hip hop is the grave yard lmfao
26:36 the future shot wasn't just because of the culture its because future says jay z over rated his only album was reasonable doubt Future always talking about Jay
I love the friendly rivalry 50 still has with Hov.
50 is so good at talking the talk about industry politics, without exposing the secrets & puppetry of the business 🤐
A true Gangsta, savage and genius, never sold out
Fifty loves to hate on Jay every chance he gets LMAO
Does 50 have a speech impediment?
There's not one rapper who speak on this level about business. 50 is a tru hustler. I salute this man 💯💯💯
26:30 NOW SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL!!!
26:51 is what you came here for
Talk about Trump starts at 34:00
Come on 50 stop going at jay.z \nAnd start making music again gun bars and dope talk are done
Can't nobody do it like Queen 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
Yeah finally 50 cent is in da building!!! It's been 3yrs damn
The best interviewed artist ever he always drop jewels 💎
The original meeting that got 50 TO Interscope started under the premise that 50 was going to come to an agreement with Ruff Ryders.
That was a great interview......hands down!
I get deep pain inside me
he's got an incredible brain and clearly a crazy high EQ. Just the way he reads situations and people is so clear and controlled. One of the smartest movers you'll see in the culture. Jay, Dre, 50, Kanye and Puff make out the Silicon Vally of Hip Hop. They're clearly so much more to there genius than the music that got them the started .
Fif dont have to like Jay a person but he respects him heavy. Thats what's up
23:40 I do not believe that HIP HOP is YOUTH DRIVEN....can't be. So what are the GEN-X listening to? Most transition into blues or designated R&B at 35/40....there is no R&B that fit the taste of Gen-X...the '70 babies are the RAP culture....actually there is no rap sound without the exec which are late BABY BOOMER (Jimmy Ivine) or Gen-X (Dr. Dre, Puffy, Jermaine, Baby, etc). These guys are SOUND discovering people.
Someone please tell me which point he confronted Ebro. I don't wanna sit through this boring ass interview for 40 mins
50 got no eye brows looking like a bancer patient
Where the 4:44 talk at ??
50 is a BETTER RAPPER then businessmen !
Hip-Hop is youth culture - 50 Cent. I personally didn't think trap music was Hip-Hop. But if this trap music is what dominates what young kids in rap make, enjoy, and listen to, then by 50 Cent's definition, trap is Hip-Hop. Artists like Your Old Droog and Doppelgangaz may be young boom-bap cats, but their music ain't getting no radio airplay... At least I haven't heard them on the radio that often (or hardly at all). Tyler, Sweatshirt, Staples may not make trap music but it is experimental or pop-sounding and heavily different from traditional-sounding Hip-Hop (Vince's Big Fish Theory was like some fuzzy, bass-heavy electro, house, trap-inspired). Bottom line: the sounds of traditional Hip-Hop is fading and a new beast had moved in. I guess we need to accept that. I enjoyed Brother Ali and Kool G's new projects but they just didn't sound like they used to. They sounded tired. Well, I may bop my head to trap if it comes on (cuz it does sound good) but my allegiance will forever be with classic Alternative Hip-Hop (De La, Tribe, Arrested Development), Boom Bap (Gang Starr, Mobb Deep, Wu), and G-Funk (Dre, Cube, Snoop, Above the Law, SCC). Hope one day there's a Boom Bap and G-Funk revival movement.
50 Cent really doesn't like these interviews
THIS Y we appreciate Ebro,so what I talk shit BOUT Laura & Peter it comes from a place of innate Tribal protection, African Dark Man&woman must know WE NEED each other.
I wanted 50 Cent and Ebro to tear each other apart. 😩😒
Game of Thrones got one more season 50 as well as Prequel series lined up. It's gonna be a while .
You know ur into yourself when you clap 👏🏿 for yourself 😂
i think ebro is son of santa claus
I love you man. Your book is awesome.
I'm kinda sad cause I don't get to see how they continued the talk after the camera was off :) Super tight interview! I got to revisualize a lot of things about 50 and it was nice to see them getting back again. Peace! Enjoyed the show, you guys rock!
Ebro SHUT THE FUCK UP NIGGA!!! Respect 50 before he steps on you worm ass nigga!!!
http://bit.ly/ProStreamingPage\nAll aspiring artists - Don't just watch these videos, get your sh#@ together!!! \n\nDon't wait until things are perfect, they probably never will be!!!\n\nGet tools and use them to market yourself and build your audience!! #Newsense\n\nhttp://bit.ly/ProStreamingPage
i skipped to 4:44 thinking there was something there.
LAURA Styles never really speak or asks questions. Rosenberg just chimes in with corny ass jokes or pointless comments
You got to give it up to 50 business mind and what he accomplished as a black man from the hood 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾✊🏿
50 the greatest rapper of all time, hands down.
25:51 to get to the good part
Always love 50 Cent interviews........never dissapointed in clicking and watching the full thing
Eminem is the reason I started listening to hip-hop music, 50 is the one who made me fell in love with it
💪🏼50........ 4:44 is for mature  adults 30 and over. This hip hop industry is for the youngins.... 50 interviews are dope always on point.
Fifty set the bar to high for New York
Curtis left the building at 23:33. Kanan in the cut beyond that point bitch
Oldman! Didn't u know G Unit then!? It was G Unit! Not G Unity! That was 50 angle of things. Them vs. Everybody.
50 drop some bars on these new kids one time !
at 34 minutes TRUMP discussion comes up and 50 cent loves trump the real recognize real, thos dum ass wack wanna be gangsta interview herbs need to reveal who payin him to hate on king trump,,, gtfoh hot 97 is literally wack and bought off,,,, rosenberg you is a herb and 50 cent loves trump, trump is the realest out there, all these new rappers the only one dissin him, or the washed up rappers...... MAKE HIP HOP GREAT AGAIN
So basically 50 is free now. So you know, what means, the music industry is coming for his head like Michael Jackson and Prince. \nI know we kind of think of 50 as the bully, but he needs our protection more than ever now. Don't allow these devils to hurt one of our brothers again man.
Only if Fif had a weekly podcast 😭😭
If I could choose a mentor for the hip hop game 50 would be it fasho. Over puffy and Jay
20:55 That's that. When Kim does that, they can't beat her at that. She better than the all of them at that 💯💯💯💯💯 #FACTS #QueenBee #Trendsetter #Mutha #QueenOfRap

Ebro is garbage.
I love 50 cent
50 cent needs a translator
26:31 - Finally someone calls out Ebro for his BS.
I hate to disappoint people. I don't think this is Donald Trump, I think it's his Confederate friends he needs to lose friendship with. He's not suppose to be a Confederate who hates black American people. That would make no sense to become a US President if he hated any group of Americans.
Hip hop is evolving and I love it, but let's not forget the legends, and the craft.
MY TOP 3 FAVORITE RAPPERS 🤔 \n- TUPAC\n- LIL WAYNE\n- 50 CENT \n🙏🏿🙌🏿👏🏾
Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
I believe simply that anyone who thinks it's right for any American, let alone the POTUS, to threaten someone for refusing to honor the flag needs to take a closer look at their idea of freedom. Part of being in a free society absolutely means that an individual has the freedom to criticize and disrespect their nation, and while an employer absolutely has the right (assuming it's in their contract) to fire their employees for certain behaviors, and we as citizens absolutely have the right to criticize those taking a knee, to do so while screaming about being a patriot is sad irony.
YOU'RE FIRED!  There are 10,080 minutes during the week they're free to do their black power thingy but choosing to do so by disrespecting the flag and the anthem?  BIG MISTAKE!  Whatever the hell it is they're trying to accomplish, rest assured will result in a big dose of the opposite. \n\nAnd what business would tolerate their employees (while on the clock) publicly disrespecting their country and pissing off the majority of their customers?  In the meantime ...\n\nWhat's with the 'Social Injustice' thingy?  Do they mean by Black Lives Matters standards?  You know, like in Baltimore when the looting (early Christmas shopping) and rioting started before anyone even realized that 3 of the cops were black (much less the facts)?  Or better yet, in Charlotte where a 'black' suspect who won't drop his weapon is shot by a 'black' cop who works for a 'black' police chief who works for a 'black' mayor naturally led to race riots with looting, destruction of property and beating up of whites?  That was special (MLK would have been truly ashamed).\n\nBut that's what happens when you automatically assume that if something bad happens to a black suspect that there must not only be wrong-doing, but it 'must' have been racially motivated (that means police vs 'citizen' becomes null and void and blacks have to be treated special?).  And never mind that blacks are 3 times more likely per capita to commit felonies.\n\nThe sad part is that had the suspects been other than black, the stories would have never even made it past their local news!!!\n\nAnd has anyone noticed that BLM hasn't even found a reason to misbehave (even by their lofty standards) for over a year now (Charlotte, with a change in the White House since)?  So what's the beef?\n\nIs it oppression?  We are talking about this millennium right?  Never mind we had a two term black president (how's that for oppressed?), or maybe too little impact on our culture?  That's a joke.  Perhaps not enough successful blacks (or millionaires for that matter) or enough special privileges or special rights?  Oh the oppression!\n\nAnd what about the double standards like how come it's OK for affirmative action (race based favoritism), black college funds (ditto), black colleges (ditto), association for the 'advancement' of the race (NAACP - just imagine the furor over a NAAWP), black pride, black advocacy, black this and black that (the list goes on and on and on) ... but yet somehow if you were to replace the word 'black' with 'white' would be considered prejudiced, racist and supremacist?  It does make a good point though for 'racial inequality'.  Speaking of equality, does mean blacks are going to raise their high school graduation rate or cut their crime rate by two thirds?  \n\nThat flag by the way, also represents the 100's of thousands of Union Soldiers (Northern Republicans) that died fighting to free the slaves from Southern Democrats.  Guess they never thought of that.\n\nAnd yeah, you have the right to embarrass yourselves, but like anything else in life, you're accountable  for your actions.  That's where the rights of others to boo, boycott, and fire your ass kick in.  And last time I checked, pissing people off isn't exactly the way to get what you want - whatever the hell that is (a higher pedestal?).  This is horseshit.\n\nAnother shameful day for the NFL punctuated by a player 'celebrating' by pretending to urinate like a dog.  Pretty much sums up the state of the league and the dangers of concussions.\n\nYOU'RE FIRED!
I agree with what many military vets including all the way back to those that fought in WW2, they fought for the players rights to do what they are doing and support them all the way.  I have seen pictures of vets taking a knee, I have and completely agree with you as well, removing the rights of those to protest removes what that flag should represent.  Trump has done more to divide this nation in 1 year than Obama did in 8, as so many try to claim he did.  I have lost long term friendships and family even that are so brainwashed into this rhetoric but turn a blind eye to all rules that show disrespect.  Those who hang flags at night without a light on it, those that wear clothing with american flags on them, those that let flags touch the ground, those that display the flag horizontal, all of which are documented ways of disrespecting the flag they all love so much but apparently they love to cherry pick the rules they want to force people to follow that fit into their current biased bubbles.  Either follow and get uptight about all the rules or none of the rules, you don't get to pick the ones you like,  like some religion of the flag.  \n  All Trump has done is totally pervert the message the taking a knee was meant to do.  He succeeded in making you forget this is about murderers who happen to do it while hiding behind a badge getting off with what boils down to a slap on the wrist.  He has won in a sense and to a narcissist like him, he is probably so pleased with himself.  I think it is disgusting and disrespectful to the seat of the white house for a president to abuse his place of power and call for the firing of anyone for any reason.  It disgusts me more and more every day to see what this country is turning into.  There is a huge divide forming and it all stems back to Trump and everything he does.  He is the most divisive president to sit in the highest place of power in this country.
excuse my ignorance since I'm American but why does the NFL player feels there is unjust in America? America is the country that provided opportunity for his career in the first place. we need to respect and honor the country first before any debate or dialogue. I disagree with Trump using his influence and power to try to shut down that player's freedom to express dissatisfaction, but he does have the freedom to do so as well.
This is going to be long. I have served in the Military. I will always stand for the Anthem. Do I feel there is disrespect in the taking the knee protest... yes. However, that is due to my own personal feelings for the flag, and anthem. They are using their constitutional, inalienable rights of freedom of speech/expression to peacefully protest. I may not agree with how they protest, but I do understand the initial reasoning of the protest. I do feel there could be other more beneficial ways to protest these injustices. I will not condemn though for their protest. I, much like any other personage that has served, swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and defend it. It is in The Oath of Enlistment. Although I have my personal feelings about this particular usage of taking the knee. I would also like to point out that there are several instances in history where taking a knee is considered a high form of respect. One would kneel before royalty. Getting knighted one would kneel. Kneeling was a form of showing fealty. Kneeling before a battle cross is an iconic form of remembrance, and respect for most of the people I served with. ( Battle Cross being a wooden cross grave marker usually, jammed into the ground boots, and dogtags hanging from it helmet on the top, and rifle leaning against it.) One of the biggest issues people do need to remember though with this protest, is that these protestor are protected by their rights from government persecution. That includes our President. He is at the top of our government. Also, a reminder is just because they're exercising their rights, does not make anyone else's usage of those same rights any less valid. All people have these rights.
The flag and the anthem don't mean a damn thing. They are not gods worthy of unconditional respect. When you put your imposed meaning on an object or idea over actual human suffering, your priorities are 100% in the wrong place.
Odd how when it's someone on the right saying or doing some shit that the far left dislikes, they have no problem rallying to get that person fired or run out of town. I do believe your saying is You have the freedom to say what you want, but not freedom from the consequences? Is that right?\n\nEither you hold the same fucking standard for everyone, or you are a fool who should be ignored. Period.
Freedom of speech does not include a freedom from facing the consequences of your free speech. Every American also has the right to react nonviolently to another's free speech. President Trump only exercised this right. \nAlso, most of us are not allowed to exercise our freedom of speech right while at our place of employment. If I did this, I would expect to be fired or at least suspended. I'm sure that's true for most Americans.\nIts funny how the player that started this protest was allowed to do it in the first place. He was allowed to wear socks depicting police officers as pigs on the field. He was allowed to wear a t-shirt supporting Fidel Castro, and Malcolm X during a press conference. How can one protest the uncivil treatment of minorities while supporting a dictator who had a history of violating civil rights and the liberty of his people. Racism in Castro's Cuba toward Black people far outweighs anything you see in today's USA. Yet he was protesting the oppression of blacks and other minorities in this country.\nThen there is the NFL. After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted, the NFL denied that right to free speech. The NFL fines players for dancing in the end zone. It threatens fines for 9/11 tributes. It shows leniency for other issues, such as domestic violence. \nLast, we have the good ole' MSM. It's all about Trump being a white supremacist. Trump has now attacked Jemele Hill, Colin Kaepernick, black NFL players, and Stephen Curry. All have something in common blah blah blah. They are actually trying to say that Trump only goes after black people. Sure, try telling that to psycho Kathy Griffin, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, or Megyn Kelly. \nMore leftist liberal spin. More say anything to get the black vote. More absolute BS!
I am a 10 year Marine Corps Vet I did the first Gulf War under Bush Sr. Yet and still wth and all white NASCAR community , 45 choose to back the FINE WHITE PEOPLE. Yet to mention or understand the whole purpose of why Colin is kneeling in the first place. The flag does not represent blacks in America and this country was built on our backs. 90% of American sit on their ass in there living room playing arm chair patriot, no since the white supremacist 45 says something, it's a big issue. What about the blacks dieing at the hands of cops? The millions locked up due to bullshit racial disparity when it comes to crack and powder cocaine. This Orange imbecile has divided this country almost as much as Jim Crow. Those days are over, we will not longer peacefully sit by and take the beatings. Have the dogs let loose on us, stand for poll taxes, or have the KKK burn crosses on our lawn. Aint no fun when the rabbit got a gun . We tried peace, and every black leader was killed by law enforcement in some way or another. Those days are over. Now all of a sudden everybody wants peace when the violence is coming back at them.
This isn't anything important we should be focussing on helping the people from all of the disasters this year. I am so mad all the time I'm watching a program and it gets interrupted by this old fart who has nothing good to say always putting everyone down take a look i. the mirror trump you are not perfect and come on you know nothing about running this country your fired!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These athletes absolutely have every right to protest in this way, and that right is protected in the Constitution. HOWEVER, the nature of their livelihood relies on butts in seats, and eyes on screens. When you do something that could alienate a large segment of those consumers, you are taking the risk they will STOP consuming. A risk the owners will decide if its worth it.
Blind patriotism is incredibly dangerous.  Trump is demanding that people stand for a flag just because it represents this country. But this country's values can be destructive and detrimental in the eyes of many.  This country only deserves respect because it boasts allowing freedom for its citizens.  Trump is attempting to deny that very freedom that makes his country so great.
Sorry Phil you're quite wrong comparing Kaepernick to Tebow - Tebow wasn't that good as an NFL quarterback - Kaepernick (given a good surrounding cast) nearly won a Super Bowl - using last year as an example given that the 49ers could quite arguably be considered the worst team in the league displays a modicum of ignorance on your part.
Attacking Athletes & pushing for a more repressive travel ban is nothing but Proof of trumps RACISM...
they are just trying to take attention away from what these players are actually protesting
I personally do not agree with the decision to also include North Korea in the ban. This is because I believe that most North Korean refugees are leaving due to starvation, poverty, and oppression, and are in no way a threat to American citizens. I also feel that while the North Korean government should be considered a threat to the United States, it is mainly just trying to show its strength and is attempting to intimidate us, not necessarily acting to attack. If anything, the inclusion of North Korea in this ban only shows that the government's efforts to assert power and strength over the United States are working.
I think the NFL Players taking the knee for the national anthem are doing the right thing to support their beliefs and freedom to express themselves as best they can. The way I see it if Trump wants these men fired then the NFL can make a deal with him. They'll fire all the players 'disrespecting' the American flag if he calls for the Nazis and white supremacists from Charlottesville to be fired from their jobs too. It's clear what the president really cares about in that context so we all know that will never happen.
hey, smart farts, (yes you) any reason why the u.s doesn't like Vanezsula? (or however you spell it) like any wars or religious reasons (like ours don't want murder and they do, just an example not ligit.) also saying sports bring us together, I hide when sports go on, I don't like sports
Why exactly does the NFL, Nascar etc... even have the US anthem played. In most other games, they play the anthem when one country's team competes another country's team. It's just strange
I'm glad that the Venezuela part of the travel ban is just for government officials. I can't imagine what it would be like to go through everything that's going on there, and then hear that the US won't let you escape it.
How can I fuck up more??\nLol
I was wondering if this was only me but doesn't kneeling is what knights do before their king? So doesn't that just mean that they are bowing down to the flag? idk maybe just me but odd way to protest
President Trump is by far the best President in US history :)
Not gonna lie, I’m kind of disappointed a huge part of the #TakeAKnee story was omitted. I know it probably wasn’t on the radar since hockey isn’t very popular but it’s incredibly relevant to the story that was covered. The NHL is a predominately white league with approximately THIRTY black players. Having the Pittsburgh Penguins confirm they will visit the White House is very telling that they do not care about their POC and LGBTQ fans, despite saying “Hockey is for everyone.” Not only is that incredibly disheartening as a fan of the team and of hockey, it’s horrible timing. They released their statement on Sunday around the same time as the NFL protests were happening. Commentators from all over the league have said that their timing was horrendous, and that had they had a choice they wouldn’t go. It’s embarrassing and upsetting as a fan to know that the face of Pittsburgh’s franchise, of hockey itself, says he is EXCITED to meet with this president, despite being aware of our current social climate. I wish this could have touched on and hope that it wasn’t something that went ignored.
Keep in mind that this is the same patriotic man that called Cain which is a vet a looser.....he uses whatever is convenient for him.....dont be fooled America
Venezuelans are in need and many of them travel to south Florida and bring money to our economy. Why is he banning them?
Protest how ever you want, that is your Constitutional right; but if you dont respect the symbol of our country as a whole then GTFO.
Why is trump in a NASCAR uniform in the thumbnail
I wouldn't kneel but I respect the ones who kneel
I understand those who are NOT kneeling for a racial issue, I do think that kneeling as a specific disrespect towards Trump's outlandish behavior as POTUS is an affective protest. However, those waters have been muddied by the racial issue. Those who are kneeling as kaepernick did are misguided and their actions are more divisive than Trump's COMPLETE AND UTTER STUPIDITY. If you kneel during the national anthem because of police brutality for only black people, you are not only kneeling on a lie, you are dividing victims of police brutality BASED ON THEIR RACE and deciding that some victims are more important in that basis. Fuck those people. (i still want them to have the freedom to do so, i just want more people to realize how stupid it is.
Its definitely their first amendment right to not stand during the anthem, not that I completely agree or disagree with it. They have the right to and if it upsets you, simply stop watching it.
If American citizens don't show the President of the USA respect, why should we expect other countries, leaders or populations to?
OMG Philip, you are definitely, not just a Democrat, but a freaking liberal
Isn't calling for people to boycott the nfl and for the problematic players to be fired a way of censoring them? I thought censorship was for countries ran by dictators or china.
As a 13 year old multiracial girl including black) who can’t walk in a mall with her hands in her pockets or out of a grocery store without being stopped or checked I feel that it’s fine what the NFL is doing. I feel that they aren’t being disrespectful to the national anthem but as to what the country is and has been. And I understand being on the other side of the argument because my papa was in the Korean War and my great uncle got a Purple Heart fighting for this country
I'm not very old, but as a Canadian that grew up in a Conservative Canada, that had a military that went hand in hand smiling with the USA to the middle east I've never seen the American flag as a banner of freedom, or any other positive symbol. I've seen it as the symbol of a bully, as someone with more power than wisdom that lashes out at things it doesn't understand, that's what it has meant to me. American vets that died in Europe defending the world from the Nazi's, those are hero's, that is America that should be celebrated, I'm not sure what happened after WWII but it changed one of the greatest countries to the worst.
Love you Phil just gotta play a game with you for a second. Lets imagine you have roughly half the country as followers. Now you state your opinion on things and it seems as though those followers tend to do what you say in agreement with you. Is it now wrong for you to have an opinion? What if you had the ability to make your opinion legally binding.....but didnt? Is it now wrong for you to have an opinion and put it out there, even though you have the power to make it law, and dont use it? Food for thought.
Phil, you may be one of the few, sane news commentators left on the internet. Great vid.
Like kids fighting in a sandbox, grow up
The star-spangled banner was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 (or '15 depending on your source), during the war of 1812. It didn't become America's national anthem until 1931.\n\nKey, like most people at the time, was racist. One of his biggest issues was with the Colonial Marines, a group of former slaves who fought for the British in exchange for their freedom. These men had overrun Key's company just a few weeks before he wrote the poem.\n\nFun fact, we only sing the first of four stanzas. The third alludes to the Colonial Marines,  and suggests that the blood of hirelings and slaves would wash away the footsteps of the British.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad the British lost. I love this country. A large part of that is because we can freely have discussions like this. But our anthem is a ballad of war from a time where institutional racism was not just the norm, but law.\n\nThat being said, I believe the protests aren't about the anthem or the flag, it's about that institutional racism that still exists today, and the social injustice that stems from that system.\n\nAnd also the fact that our Commander (or rather Complainer) in Chief is an ass.
Tebow isn't in the NFL anymore because he has no passing game. Running is fine when you're 22 but when you're 32 your bony will be destroyed.
I just found this channel and I've already subbed! You are one of the most neutral news reporters I can find in these divisive times. Thank you for your impartiality.
Haha let them stay on their knees like their father taught them. True Americans always stand up.
question who really gives AF !?  Anyone no pretending ether
The things that Trump says are generally drivel, period.  However, I still defend the idea that he can say those things, it's just incredibly concerning that our president _wouldn't_ defend that very same right.\n\nedit: italics.
Trump is trying to hijack a boycott already in progress!!!!
Hey #25 on the trending page!
multi millionaire taking knees for world peace during a unity sport 😒Other side of the world little girls and boys on their knees trying to survive on whatever piece the world gives them 😩😭
Who thinks Trump will be assassinated?
I liked this video because I like you. But it was the hardest thing to get through because it was all based around Trump 😳
Steph curry doesn't even know why he doesn't want to go to the White House. Dude gave a clueless statement on the fly....
anthony wiener is going to have the worst 21 months of his life when he's in prison.
Free speech but not at their tax subsided job.
I like how they had to censor the bulge lol
them: STAND!       me: but.. I'm lazy...+
Phil's gonna get demonetized for Trump's Neckgina in the thumbnail
I personally feel as long as people have their hands on their hearts and facing the flag, I don't have an issue, anyone else?
trump may be the only person in the world with a civil rights award that is labeled a racist like this. Old people that are racist have ALWAYS been racist, you don't just become racist because you switched parties cause it was the only way on the ticket.
In Football kneeling has always been about respect.\nKneeling in front of your coaches to listen to them.\nKneeling for a fellow player in the field that is hurt.\nKaepernick listen to this country then kneel to show respect to the fact that the US is hurting.\n\nSTOP POLICE VIOLENCE
Why is it funny to me that his last name is weiner. Obvi his weiner is all he thinks about lol
Taking a knee during the flag, by kapernicks admission and agreement with a veteran after meeting with him, is him paying respect to the soldiers who have fallen to defend the rights of citizens and what the flag stands for, while also showing that he feels the flag is being disrespected. Freedom Of Speech is a right and virtue of america and american citizens. Entertainer, or otherwise (lest we forget trump is a entertainer and business man first and a politician as of the last 9 months).
Look a protest isn't supposed to be respectful. If your not inconvenienced by it, it ain't a protest. \nPersonally, I don't see why people think it's disrespectful. Kneeling has always been something respectful. You kneel to propose, you kneel to the crown.\nIt's not like these people are just straight up yelling during the anthem.
I think now is a good time to talk about the differences between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism, to me, is the idea of being proud of where you're from. Where on the flipside, nationalism is the idea that not only where you're from is the best, but that they can do no wrong. By taking a knee and sayin I'm disappointed with what people are doing in the name of this flag  does not detract from someone being patriotic. In fact, in my opinion, it enhances it.
Lmao it would be NASCAR owners that go all in...
I dont believe the flag represents all the wonderful things people think it does. The stars and stripes and stars and bars are brothers. There is no decent american history.
NASCAR drivers used to sit in their cars during the anthem. The NFL didn't do these anthem ceremonies until the military paid them too. This is not about a flag or anthem or the military. The military doesn't protect a cloth it protects the citizens of this country. Some citizens have been under siege lately by police over reach with no repercussions. Where is the military at in protecting those citizens? They took an oath to protect American citizens from threats foreign and domestic this over militarization of the police is a threat to our nation that we should all be standing against. Not all cops are bad but there are bad cops and by not punishing them for their actions it's tarnishing the name of the entire profession.
7:55 - 8:08 when I saw this,  I got so jealous. I wish we had a prime minister like Donald Trump!
I don't know if it was covered, but I feel the original reason Kaepernick began kneeling is important to the story.  Originally his protest was by sitting during the National Anthem and it was Nate Boyer who convinced him to take on kneeling instead as a way of showing respect to the military, but not loose the message that this country still has issues that need to be addressed.  I think the article and exchange between those two were powerful and makes the stance mean more.
America is founded on the protest of taxes by England onto the colonies. Protests gave women the right to vote and brought civil right to people.  Those protesting NFL players and owners are being REAL AMERICANS. Those people that booed them are ignorant sheep slaves and are FAKE AMERICANS. Everyone has the right to protest even the tiki torch people who are oppose to the players who kneeled.The FLAG is a piece of cloth and the so called hardcore patriots are worshipping it, committing Christian BLASPHEMY. Idol worshipping the flag won't get your poser asses into heaven people...
My question to everyone who supports the actions of the NFL and the NBA: What in the hell are you protesting? Steph said something about what we tolerate in this country, what's accepted, and what we turn a blind eye to. What is he referring to? I, honest to God, have no fucking idea how blacks are oppressed in this country. Someone please tell me.\n\nTo clarify: if you want to protest, that's awesome. That's your right as an American. The Hitler Youth and Nazis in WWII were forced to salute and sing anthems, so i'm against forcing someone to do something they don't believe in. But why are they doing it?
It discourages me that people still think that kneeling is is disrespectful toward our flag and our country. It absolutely is not. In my town our little league football teams would kneel whenever a player from the home team or the opposing team would get hurt, same thing would happen with the softball team I used to be on, we would kneel. That’s just what these players are doing now, kneeling for anyone who has been harmed in anyway by any racial issue or discriminatory act. There is no disrespect toward our country being shown what-so-ever.
Donald trump will fail, not because he is a bad president, not because he can't achieve his aims to make America great again, but because people hate him more than they love their country, and that they want the man who is running their country to fail, just because they want to prove a point, no matter how badly their country fucks up.
I will put this to you Phil as a business man. What would you do if you had an employee that used their position on your show to start protesting something? Let's say it is some very important issue. Let's say you even agree with their protest. Day after day during office hours they would build a banner and stick it on the wall behind you in your recording studio. Would you be interfering with your employees free speech if you said you can't put that up there? Would you mind paying somebody who was spending 1 or 2 hours every day to make a sign or some other way to protest? How would your other employees feel about this protester after a week or 2 of this. How would your subscribers take it? These athletes are paid to play football not to protest. Anybody who says it violates their free speech is naïve or full of shit. Free speech happens on your own time.
It's the wrong platform to stand on Our Flag and Anthem, sickening!\nBoycotting NFL and calling Directv for refund of Sunday Ticket Package!
Fire every one of those who disrespected our flag.
This is disgusting to see people completely disrespecting our great country that our ancestors who died for us so we could have our freedom
You are an employee of the NFl teams. Just because you use freedom of speech does not mean you are right, or that your untouchable. You dont get those rights without consequences. You work for these teams so yes you can be fired at any time. You can't be pissed about Trump using sports in his political way., when thats exactly what your doing. Talking about agendas, is no different.
What happens if a judge enters the courtroom and you protest not to stand?
Imagine a white player passing up a white house visit during Obama
Just because something is legal, doesn’t mean it’s right. First of all, they were being extremely disrespectful by kneeling for a flag that represents out country and everyone who fought and died for it. Secondly, if they want to speak their political agenda, save it for another time, not during your job. Thirdly, they stood for England’s flag but not ours? That’s just worrying...
The whole thing with the GSWarriors is fucking ridiculous. Lebron tries to say Trump is starting it? Stephan Curry started it by refusing to go in the first place. HE brought politics into sports. What, hes trying to make a stance? A Change? By refusing to go to the White House? \n\nAnd now Lebron is trying to virtue signal by saying Trump is the one dividing us? How about the constant attacks by the rich liberal media, celebrities and athletes. They all live in their own little echo chamber bubble and think they are saving the planet. What a joke.
The NFL has shown in the past that it doesn't care at all about free speech. Teams and players have been fined or threatened with fines for attempting to pay tribute to cops killed in action, raising awareness of spousal abuse, and recognizing the victims of 9/11. But when it comes to players actually violating NFL rules regarding standing for the anthem, the NFL is silent.
NFL say they are not going to support being divisive while being divisive. The irony is strong with these ones. We're not going to play politics. Then just stand up in front of everyone during the national anthem.
Trump didnt call for shit!  Why is he not allowed to have an opinion?  People are saying hes trying to infringe one their 1st amendment rights when all he is doing is exorcising his! You say fuck you to the country cuz one bad cop... I say fuck you to you. Its that simple.
It's not a Muslim ban ffs
Oppression is why you are a millionaire, right Kaperdick...
Consistent bell ignore rock teach branch bus
TRUMP 2020!
WAIT WAITWAIT STOP!!! Why is Donald trump wearing mark martins 2012 NASCAR sprint cup micheal waltrip racing #55 Aaron's Toyota car uniform?
Clickbait add chasing
On 10 trending at MM Phil
kim jong un kneeled too lel
Girl fights
Good job NASCAR!
boycott NFL
Trump is 100% right!
If I were an owner I'd fire anyone taking a knee. Not because they are proforming what is in the end a completely empty gesture, but because they are inviting controvery. Football is about football, not politics.
How many people from North Korea come here illegally though? And Venezuela ban is only banning certain specific government officials lmao. Obviously it’s a Muslim ban, not saying I’m AGAINST the ban, but come on now.
F**** 45.. all he complained about was the left wanting to abolish the 2nd amendment and then what does he turn around and do? complain about americans using their 1st amendement rights.. calling for them to be fired is unethical and not his place, he did not even need to speak on it.. and for him to talk about disrespect is baffling to me... he is one of the most disrespectful people i have ever witnessed on this earth other than child molesters and terrorists.... cant wait for his term to be over....
Imagine...\n\n\n\n\n\nFree roam Star Wars Battlefront so you could fly your ship to any planet...\nJesus Christ that would be sick
Please tell me there's pods multiplayer
EA: Alright time to stop fuckin around.
Omg I can't wait for the game to come out
Or... They could've just been like siege, adding these new maps, vehicles and heroes in a FREE update to revive Battlefront 1
I want count dooku in here as well
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL CONQUEST GM THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA ADD?!?!?
This is microtransactions incarnate. Fuck you, EA. Oh, and fuck you too, Disney. Can I use mind trick in this game even if I don't wtf mind trick is? Because Mary Sue Rey could.
It's a shame they had to release the entire first game + 4 or more DLC before they realised the game was a shambles. It shows they knew exactly what to do, just chose not to until now.
This a great improvement over BF1 but the microtransactions/star cards have no place in a full priced game and still no Galactic Conquest. I'll wait for the reviews.
I am not buying this game till I can play as Episode 3 Anakin. You decide how soon that'll be, EA.
Still don't see any Droidekas! The one thing I was looking forward to playing as.....Dam it.
I PRESUME ORDER IT HYPE HYPE HYYYYYYYYPE WAIT IT'S not here HOLD ON ONLY 3 DAYS EARLY ACCESS UGHHH LAME
soo... you mean to say you actually tried this time
I love how it's literally a marketing point to show how shitty the first one is over this one.
OH MYYYYY HOW MANY DLC IS IN THAT GAME
now this is what they should've done with the first one to begin with, well done EA, now to see the catch
This is ... another shitty EA game
Is there no walker assault?? That would suck
Wait..so you're tellin me... They finally listened to us??
Looks like Star fighter mode is separate from being on the ground
Man! That was so well explained and showcased. I am pretty much sold on this :) It looks fucking amazing !
This is getting out of hand. Where ARE those droidekas??
This is honestly a pretty good marketing trailer. I'm not even that hyped for the game and it kind of made me excited.
This is where the fun begins.
Fuck it I'm robbing wal Mart for this shit the hype just made my balls explode
Man y’all should really add “bring cargo” again. That was my favorite game mode on the last battle front game
Star Wars Battlefront EA II. Don't forget you put EA in the title :P
Rey is gonna be the Luke Skywalker from Battlefront I. Except she looks more like a faggot
I see a pay to play. 👀
where is geonsis bf2 is missing best map
It's looks amazing but how dare they say that this is a Star Wars experience like none other. I think you're forgetting about another Star Wars battlefront 2.
I've got a baaad feeling about this. Heroes not locked to their eras will be so off putting, Star cards will ruin balance and the re-skinned Battlefield game modes will tire out quickly. Repeating the same mistakes as Battlefront minus the random weapon pickups. I guess we will never see the old leaked gameplay of Battlefront III come to life. 6/10 for being pretty and unique sp story but uninspired gameplay, imo of course
Hopefully split screen 2plyr online modes as well
4:04 - The new Resistance A-wing! :O\n\nI sure hope they don't let us down with this new Arcade mode. I'm concerned they've focused too much on providing a cinematic single player campaign and not enough on an improved instant action mode like Skirmish was in the last game. That had so much potential and it went to waste. I'm going to be really bummed if Arcade turns out to be an improved version of Missions. An improved instant action mode that supports all maps, modes and a greatly enhanced AI should take priority over a single player campaign.
I'm not gonna bother pre ordering after the first one. enjoyed it but too many annoying features. Wana see how the reviews play out before spending any cash
WHERE IS JAR JAR?!? I need him!
Create Star Wars for VR and then I’ll be impressed
lol just remake the old game with better graphics and customizable weapons. it would sell like crazy
Please change the name so the original battlefront games dont have to be related to this pile of shit.
Why not all games are built like this? It has Beautiful graphics, Can easily run 60fps even in 4k and large multiplayer support, and even Doom and Wolfenstein can pull of such Graphics
How do I get accesses to the beta on the fourth as I pre orderd the game o n disc
This is a good year for gaming, fans are getting what they want for every game. CoD WW2 is boots on the ground and Star Wars BF2 is looking amazing and better than the last one, i’ve missed some games but these two will probably will be the best sellers
I bet this shit won't have Anakin or the Jedi Temple :/
Hm... okay... interesting... wait a tic... WHERE TF IS WALKER ASSAULT??!!?!?!
It seems like they’re heading in the right direction like the old battlefront games.
It would be cool if they had a game mode that was always going, like in planetside, and you fight for territory and at the end of like a week the faction with the most territory get rewarded
What you can play in splitscreen only arcade or more?
But... in these space modes will I be able to board fighters of my choice and fight in starships as well as dogfight in space like in the original SWBF2 (Rest in Peace)?
Well this fixes almost all my complaints about the first one.
John Boyega 2017: Finn will be there of course
The Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront 1 is free right now for PS4
People are so stupid. 90% of the people out there bitchin and moaning about EVERYTHING. It actually looks like they put the time into this one because the first one was way too simplistic. Everyone seriously needs to take a breath and relax. As soon as people get something they want, they will just bitch about something else.
Introducing the new Star Card system, where the more money you spend for a higher tier card, the more powerful it's effect in battle. Choose the right time to open up your wallet on the battlefield, and be ready to fatten my bank account.
I love this game! I can't wait for it!
There’s an alarming lack of Republic Commandos
To address a lot of peoples concerns:\nThis game does have micro transactions in the sense you spend money to get crates with a chance of giving you better start cards. Better star cards means lower cool down and other minor differences. You can still earn these cards by playing the game. It's no different than Battlefield's battle packs or Overwatch's loot crates. Also all the DLC's are free and you will not be required to buy anything more than just the base game. People need to quit complaining and appreciate the fact that the devs have done so much more this time around. They delivered on most things people asked for and yet people continue to find something else to cry about. How about appreciating the fact we get free DLC's and much more.
The first part looked like an uncharted scene
Basically the game we should have gotten in 2015..
Doesnt have galactic conquest. Not worth it.
If there's no garlic bread I'm not interested.
Looks incredible, to bad they did the same boring loot box shit honestly just let people level up for stuff.
Jesus looks so real and amazing omg I can't wait!!!!
Game looks awesome but I'm a little disappoint at only 5 game modes but we'll see how fun the new ones are!
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
They had better deliver.
Nice game
I keep watching this Lol
MINDBLOWNINEEDTHIS
Yay. Pay to win mechanics.
Huh all this yet no galatic conquest?
REMEMBER NO PREORDERS!!!
Camino! Thank God.
Boyega is a cuck
Need new undies.... worth it
we need general grevious!!!!!
For the republic!
Looks epic !
Almost as good as battefront 1
Only 20 v 20?\n\nHmm, not sure. :(
pleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuck
HOLY FUCK! This gave me goosebumps...
Is that John Boyega?
Insecure of Paragon much?
20 versus 20 wtf ???
Lite
MORE OFFLINE MODES PLEASE
Waiting for the downgrade
0:48 made me cringe so hard.....
Watch those wrist rockets
4:07 Watch those wrist rockets!
Woah woah woah only five game modes?!
At 2:28 I seen Chewy!!!
2:58 lol rip Kylo
No Droidekas as playable characters??? :( Or are they going to be star-card weapons (if they Actually appear in the game)?
Will I be in the game?
02:26 Chewy stands on a nail 🤔
Still praying for galactic conquest :(

Not so top secret anymore... he was in the vlog.
I can't go to Hello World because of something called the Atlantic Ocean. Who else can relate 😂😭
I enjoyed the video.  You guys together are interesting and entertaining. Thank you Jim.
this makes me so happy.
DON'T TEASE US ABOUT THE BAND! 😭
Jim now that the book is finished, are you getting back on the vlog grind? The return of Jim?

I don't get how Jim acts like he and Louise are awesome friends when him and Tanya didn't invite her to their wedding but htey invited Hannah Hart. Jim did a radio show with Louise so you think that they would be better friends than Hannah.
Chance is fucking legend
Ahh I see what you did here, Colbert. You made Chance drop a great song on your show so I couldn't dislike your video for once.
Anyone notice how the farther the song progressed the brighter the background got until the end when it was bright and he goes here it is talking about the day. Not super subtle but I just love how much Chance puts into his live performances😊
This song now has a title. Chance has named it First World Problems.
I just cried, I love it !
I swear Chance is a pastor...
damn this is good ! looping it
HAVE A DREAM AND THEN NEVER WAKE UP
This is SOUL FOOD.
Chance The Rapper just need to be my boyfriend 😍\nDaniel  I'm counting down the days until I see you Live🤗😙
The Jesus metaphors are over 9000 !!!
Wow good performance but a lot of pot smoking went into writing that... hahaha!
wow this is crazy good , these guys are the truth man, beautiful music !
4:54 lol it was at this moment that the drummer knew,, he screwed up
its honestly not that good
His song was so immense let's seize the day together.
This song is so right now
He reminds me of eminem if Eminem was Christian lmao
It's too happy
keep on playin, we gon shake this shit up 🗣
The title of this joint should be ON ITS WAY.  I'm all for it!!!
I've been in desperate need of this
the man takes me to church everytime.
This sounds like shit. There is no beat, they're singing off-key,  he's not even rapping to the Rhythm , and it's just terrible.  They're not even performing the song with feelings.  They sound like they just woke up and wants to go back to bed. .  Do people really like this song or are they paid commenters????
THAT ONE GUY IN THE FLANAL FUCKING SHIT UP #FIRSTWORLDPROBLEMS
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Have a dream and then never wake up, gets me every time. Gives me chills
this is too much, my heart is exploding
Here it comes. Ready or not.💯
Fucking Noble. This is what true to be royalty looks like.
This is so beautiful.
This song isn't for the hypebeats, PERIOD
I`m so happy right now
I feel like Chance is in a lot of pain. I hope he's okay. Great song, by the way! Thanks for this, seriously!
Okay yeah but can we talk about Daniel Caesar too?!
Colbert: And now performing a new unreleased track with Daniel Ceaser , ladies and Gentlemen, Chance the Rapper \n\n*Crowd Cheers*\n \nMe : Man I love this song already ❤️😭
He should call it First World Problems or New Day
I love this already
This man can do no wrong , such a soul touching and peaceful song about life and values
222 down votes? like wtf you even watching this for then?
in every way this is art chance is so real and authentic thats my DAD❤️❤️❤️✊🏾✊🏿
I love how Chance the Rapper is so chill. Can he be my friend please
I have so much respect for Chance.
Bruh honestly. I have a feeling that this song finna' be called On my way or something. This song was perfect by the way chance. I ain't surprised as a fan
That was deep and fresh.
Shout out to colbert for knowing good stuff
Was that Daniel Caesar
He curses too much. Why can’t anyone make inspiration music. Sheesh.\n\n\n\n\n*Sarcasm*
Wow! Is this on streaming apps yet??
Can't wait for the official drop. This was so good! Chance that role model you want your kids to be watching y'know?
the black man is waking up. \nDon't tell the white supremacist but this song is all about revolution and empowerment
Stephen Colbert got lucky with this one
i have had this song on repeat for the past two days
Chance has so much power in his words
I came here after Joe Budden's reaction
damn that was impressive
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow
BARS SO HARD
Thirdstory
Planting the seed. Thanks chance.
Chance is actually anointed.
This is amazing!!!
Joe Budden be hating smh
Humming like Kid Cudi lol
#ChanceTheRapper #ThirdStory #DanielCaesar Keep It Up #SPREADTHEWORD #GODSWORD ☝️❤️
This is freakin beautiful
DAMNNNNN
WTF this is shit
Make this album
Shit give me chills yo damn
Literally crying.... Chance kills it again.
Musique inspirante, paroles puissante
Just beyond AMAZING!!!!! ohweeeee!!! Chills...goosebumps...heart POUNDING...EVERYTHING!!!
I love it...
Very dull
Tearjerking lyrics
ROCKY?
Incredible.
Damn chance. You are on another level than the rest. It's always great to hear new music from you.
Love the vulnerability and movement of this song. This will be on repeat for some time.
You just gotta love him
The old chance is back 🙌🏾
Why people still sleeping on Chance? He's so underrated
When is it gunna be on Apple Music then
Seriously one of his best works can't stop listening to it
Come on guys .... Don't forget check the video and click on a subscription, because i am going to subscribe to come back to each other support with 🔽🔽👇👇\nhttps://youtu.be/FASnu6t5_VQ
Song name?
I've always said Daniel & Chance should collab, and it's happening!!!
I like chance , but I feel as if when it came to the singing part, let Daniel Caesar sing and you rap, utilize his young talent more . Either way great song man
Chance the rapper is a gift from GOD!
The best in the business right now
I was sent here by joe budden. Bruh trippin. this is fire!
If you listen to the song he talks about how exhausted he is and its making me sad
Wow.
Sadly he had to debut it on a shitty talk show
😁😁😁😁 This shit sucks.
Makes me sad that fame took its toll on Chance. I wish he could be this rapper that i love AND the family man that he so clearly has in his heart
The song isn't just 'pretty sounding' it's also deep! For two days of writing it's amazing how chance can not only show his personal struggles with his wealth/fame, but then also point out how we are all to blame for the issues of the world right now by being complacent and not actively trying to fix issues that have been going on for far to long.
Huge chance fan, but I still don't know what genre this is.. Can anyone suggest music similar to this?
Your not bad, I'm bad, ask Carlos jheeeeeez!
I love this, it was beautiful and had such a powerful message
Dopee

Stormzy scares me shitless
Kinda like Meeks one
'Ghanaian queen'🏆💎
massive message being sent out by stormzy. man is real and a perfect example that it doesnt matter were you are from who your around and what your involved in. its up to you to choose your path find your power your energy and create your own faith and strength and defeat your demons and decide are you worth or waste .
Man's on a different radar
Subscribe to my channel for a daily vlog, obviously mans new to this ting , let’s hit 1000 subscribes for my first video come on!!!
too big for the room
mans said come to ya block in my pj's
It was a pleasure been part of this project! More than a just music video!!
This is really a movie 🎥💯🔥🔥
jehova...corbyn..you get me ..what a pile of shit = stormzy the low iq idiot
Aint hating but isn’t this similar to bugzys facing time ting?
That man should've never said kindness shows weakness, harsh lol
what the fuck Lukaku can rap ?
When you remember stormz got 6 A* at gcse
100 bags has to be my favourite stormzy song ever! I've said it since the start, it's a grime masterpiece
The coach scenes remind me too much of FIFA journeys
My absolute love, Stormz out here living life 🙌🙌 inspiration
Same old shit, different goon on the mic
This video is a mad ting, Stormzy is definitely one of the best ever 💯💯
How do I get this off my YouTube home? This faggots never been in a gang and will keep dreaming about being in one, please just fuck off my YouTube recommendations.
The moral to the story? \nStormzy this is reality..  the devils..\nits about breaking the strong holds! of our minds our childrens.. It is written 📖 thats all we need to do plus follow it! constantly battles with will and mind. 💟mind💟 the heart the spirit of Jesus within us ALL!  some of our youth today are lost! Akala would also disect this and teach. We all need God in these last days of tribulations. Romans 8:6 Isiah 26. 3
You Illuminati...some of us know.
Some boy from my school was in that
Being not the north the insult pussy hole is honestly the most pathetic sounding insult
Never been so gassed to a song in the end credits 😂😂😂
Stormzy's pure inspiration for so many
This is just top boy with different actors
This hits home hard
was that filmed in east london?
This was amazing! Well done to all involved!
holy shit this is the best thing ive ever seen
Yo stormzy big work keep it up
Raise the roof fam! Cz his head about to hit that.
At 10:23 I though Perfect Cell was about to make an appearance. If you know you know  lol
That's cool 😎 I think it's really great 👍
So good, but wish it was a bit longer!
Do people really call this Rap? This is complete and utter shit
You don't know what you have till it's gone❤️
Ok let’s just tell all the little chavs to carry on with their drugs and shanks, no harm
Not really a grime/rap/rnb person or stormzy fan in particular but this was amazing
As soon as I heard the hood and the n word I disliked.  \nI'm tired of my black brothers selling out and calling your own kind niggas.
Nahhhh. This was way better than expected. I gotta listen to the whole album in order again now.
Why do I get the impression that the film is referring to Croydon
I've been to that barbershop!
Amazing conveys a true and honest message
When is it out
That was acc amazing so much love for stormzy
Biggest Inspiration!!!!!, says it all for us Londoners 👌🏽
Is it just me but does the ringtone at 8.20 sound like shut up???
I know how it feels g
Were bits of this filmed in camberwell ?
Did anyone else notice lines from other artists in the dialogue? \n\nGo back and watch it again...
the concept of this is so revolutionary in grime, making productions like this is really giving grime the right vision that these mc's dj's producer's arent all gangsters involved in crime or living up to that steereotype, it shows the talent this genre called 'Grime' has real raw talent who can make big movements and make good money and make a success out of it \n\nbig up stormzy for showing people how much potential is in GRIME
What bollocks. Most kids from estates amount to nothing cos their dads aren't around and the mothers blames the government for not doing more for them. The kids I remember from estates were rude, obnoxious and thuggish. I had no more or less than them in terms of money. But I had loving parents. These kids will continue the cycle of being shitty people, sell drugs, join gangs and generally fuck up communities. Stormzy is a talented person, not taking anything away from him. But chances of other kids doing the same are slim to none. But yet all the kids watching this will be like, mans gonna focus on my music ting. Why don't you focus on your school ting.
God of Jehovah
Monkey poems, done before. More black youths to feel sorry for. 🔫💉💊❌

Don't let the media industry seduce you Stormzy, lest u lose sight of ur calling?To many young people need u to keep it real!!! and pure x
Hey guys, I tried uploading this a few days ago, but had a technical fault - so had to remove it! If you're wondering why you've seen it before - you were in the lucky 1000 views previously! X
Love your vids. This one is super quiet though :/ no hate! Just didn't know if you were aware. :)
The fact that she drops everything just freaks me out 😂 no offense, love you em 💓
Cara delevingne brows right there
I thought this would be a fail for sure. Pretty cool. Definitely would be hard to get even I think
I just love how clumsy you are and so jumpy. So cute! Love your chanell btw!
Keep this background pls
I love the fact that now she smiles alot in the videos 😍😍\n. Yes.. that brow stamp .. nailed it 😍
These brows look SO good on you!! No one has perfectly matching brows so no one would give yours a second look. We are our own worst critics - but this looks really, really good. Like, I want to try it now!!!
Plzzz change ur name from my pale skin to beautiful me coz u look so beautiful
Try the EgoEra facial mask maker. It looks interesting.
Actually this is intriguing! I'm missing half an eyebrow from a dog attack if this would work then it would save me so much time everyday having to completely draw on my brow from scratch and having to match it to the other. Does anybody know how pigmented the powder is on just plain skin???
Your reactions was so funny! I tried it on my mother but oh no, it wasn't so pretty lol
You're always dropping things 😂 \nLove your videos ♥️
your mazing and make my day your so funny! ENERGY. BUT can we get fall makeup LOOK?! OR NO..AND look idk stamp hmm how make eyebrows perf lmaooo did , OTHER HACKS instgram hype lol no missed video so new! TROOPER MOTIVATION GREAT . what foundation using?!
I love this!  I'm going to have to try it.  I would love to see a tutorial on your makeup look in this video!
You're the only person I've seen who didn't completely miss their brow when using this product!!
Yes I‘ve seen this video a few days ago😂
Brow stamp pretty cool....what eye shadow are you wearing it's lovely!!!
Awesome video!!!!
Love the video! So happy you finally uploaded this video!
I feel like you already did this before! Dejavue. Just like the video where you tested the Derma-high-coverage foundation! :D
I thought that only i have got one easy-brow and one hard-brow x)
I really like the thicker brow on the left.
Hey !! Just one suggestion- start giving marks out of 10 to the products u review. That would be good. Love your videos. :*
I CANT BELIEVE YOUR GOING TO HELLOWORLD ARGH I AM SO EXCITED
I think this could actually work for me!? Still better than doing it all with my clumsy hand! LOL :D
The product is pretty good may try it myself 😊
could u do a full face of elf i know that you done a full face of drugstore with some elf products in but could you do a full face if that possible? btw i luv ur channel :)

WHAT ANNOYS ME ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN BOOTY HOLES IS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN AFRICA WHERE THEY SHOULD BE LIVING AND SPEAKING THEIR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND WEARING THEIR OWN AFRICAN CLOTHING AND MAKING THEIR OWN AFRICAN MUSIC AND PLAYING THEIR OWN AFRICAN SPORTS. YOU AFRICAN BLACKS AREN'T GOING TO SPEAK THE WHITE MANS LANGUAGE AND LIVE WITH US WHITE FOLKS FOREVER ARE YOU? MY LIFE LONG STRUGGLE WITH THE AFRICAN BLACKS. I HIGHLY DISLIKE MULTICULTURALISM AND DIVERSITY AND ANTI-CHRIST JUDAISM AND ISLAM.

CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\n\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\n\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\n\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\n\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\n\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \n\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John
Hiii vlog brothers i have one question im curious to know what driven ppl in ancient world to do war on each other. ( kinda know about this ) and what happen to that soldier who died in battle and what they really get in return from participating in wars. what happen to there families?  lol anicient world question
Why doesn't this guy mention what the leaks were? Since they had such a huge impact in Trump's favor, I would assume the actual contents of the leak would be discussed. This guy and the media are holding from you info you should know. The Russians wanted the American people to know how fd up the establishment dems are! Stop being ignorant.
You have small eyes bro
Links from msm... more fake news
So this whole thing is about thing of value? What a waste of time.
Loving the fact the trump-Russia ideology, and the Russian influenced election was just  started by 4chan, the news and government is so scared they blame Russia instead of calling out the real winners. Now today we got this video lol you guys are too deep.
 Thank you John for making this video :^) \n\n$0.05 has been deposited into your account
A secret spy agency with a track record of terrible failures says Trump is connected to Russia and you pay attention. Your confirmation bias is showing. And the appeal to authority logic fallacy is so sophomoric. You get an F.
That moment you realize you came to an author/entertainers channel to hear about politics after you have been mad that the footyball players don't just do their job and stop being political...
In the first 35 seconds immediate focus on Russian crimes. Do you want to hold up a mirror to the US?? Do they invade or bomb countries???
Oh boy, here we go with more of this... can we please go back to science where people are actually finding evidence of cool things, rather than just pointing fingers like first graders?
Pee pee tape?\nBut no really what about the Steele dossier? Not saying it's utterly true, just that some of it has been corroborated, the dude behind it was considered a credible source of intelligence, and it is relevant, right?
what we know - leftists are forever lying cry-bullies;   FBI was never given access to DNC servers - gee, nothing fishy there\nJohn Podesta on the executive board of Joule Unlimited which received millions from a Putin-connected Russian govt fund;   \nBill Clinton received half a million dollars for a speech he gave in Moscow, paid by a Russian firm that has ties to Russian intel
What do the vlogbrothers think about ideological and psychological safe spaces vs. unfettered spaces for free discourse (free speech spaces? or free discourse spaces?)
John, I still think you did an amazing job in your original video.  You said we don't have the whole story. Comments seem to want you to have a crystal ball with the whole story.  Not only the whole story but THEIR version of the whole story. \n\nLet's wait for the facts, shall we?  And dftba and make a few mistakes now and then. If we didn't we would be so very boring
Yankees, just go home live your lives and leave the rest of us live ours. Also, Mr. Green, get your facts straight, will ya?
Probably my favorite part of this video was when he said that almost anyone can find conformation bias evidence
I'm not saying you guys need to redo the election, but I'm saying you guys need to redo the election.
I'm 13 seconds in. You look like you're a Hillary supporter, so I'm gonna put you on blast if you asperse President Trump in any way throughout the whole video, or if you sprinkle it around in the video like paprika and ground pepper.
Captivating, John. Why don't you become a politician!!
most air quotes in a video.\ncan someone explain the reports of people using private emails that have been in the news? does it matter which email account they use or are the reports implying that they are breaching government confidentiality by talking to people they shouldnt? assuming the 2nd part but the articles tend to be vague.
Oh boy,  I love when YouTubers, or any public figure, thinks they need to talk about Trump:/ like dude just put your content out, no one cares about your political opinion
Its clear Mr. Green is defending his political opinions and not prosecuting them in this video, which is intellectually dishonest.  Instead of looking to make a case for what you believe to be true make a case against it.
The present and future of our democracy is much more threatened by the FISA requests and unmasking.  How about your next video addressing 'FISA Requests and Unmasking a Presidential Campaign of the Opposing Party while in Power.'\n\nTo me this is a monumentally greater threat to democracy than the tangential stuff you identified here.  Even if Trump and Co. colluded, it is unlikely that this would be repeated.  But if Obama and Co. used to power of the state to spy on an opposition party during a campaign (we call that a 'fishing expedition'), this is a very real and present threat which can be abused by either party.  We united as Americans can defeat any foreign enemy.  But for the enemy within, the threat is real and grave.  Give me your thoughts.
_no one else was in the room where it happened_
A year later, you libtards still can't get over trumps win 😂 you guys are a bunch of snow flakes ❄
Forgot to mention this is all speculation
I was expecting some some cringe, but this was all very reasonable.  I would have thought it might be worth the mention that the US government routinely intervenes in foreign elections, just to give some broader context.
Two globalist MSM fake news outlets published the same details? LOL CONFIRMED FACTS. Watch the Project Veritas videos, it's all debunked. Media is lying.
That moment when everyone thinks the comments will suck but they aren’t that bad
Can you do a tax plan video after more details come out
Hey help me reach my goal for my birthday guy all donations are for st Jude children hospital https://www.facebook.com/carlos.k.rodriguez.5/posts/1916402021703600
I still want to see any proof of collusion and/or interference. Even the investigators say there is none.
The Vloghoes have done more to divide the USA then Russia has lol
Love how he didn't link the verified emails on wikileaks.....at this point, the only true unbiased source of news
Is there actually any specific motive for interference in the US election by Russia? They used to say the reason was to revive the exxon mobil oil deal, but that was rejected by the Trump administration so I just don't see why the Trump team would collude and why Russia would risk worsening their country's reputation and their relationship with the US, if there isn't anything to gain?\n\nAlso, is there actual proof that the emails were 'hacked' by Russia and given to Wikileaks? According to Julian Assange many of the emails were leaked from an inside source? Perhaps this was just wikileaks doing what it has always done.
My hope is that Mueller's findings will be published just like the 9/11 commissions report was and just like the CIA Torture report was. So that we can have a clear and definitive statement on what went down and who knew what and when. There will always be people on both sides that read more into this than is actually there but a document presented by the government is as good a source as we are going to get.
The biggest Liberal conspiracy :)....SAD!
All of what you said is coincidence. No actual evidence has come put saying that the russian allegations are true. You are fake news
We have far more dots than you seem to realize.
Trump benefited from the DNC hack, no doubt but that's not necessarily his fault. Damning information about the Clinton campaign was revealed and public reacted to in a big way. That hack was a public service allowing voters to make a more informed decision, just a shame nobody got a hold of trump's tax returns
Can you take a half step back from the camera? On my 50 TV it's like you're right up in my face.
Oh John, I just know you're gonna get a bunch of trolls.
John your first correction is incorrect. Nixon /was/ impeached because impeachment is the investigation and voting process to remove a president from office, not the actual removal of the president. So, you were more correct before the correction.
8:40 Future of our democracy. That's a funny joke.
https://igg.me/at/THHF0eKPf0Y \n\nShow some love, take some time to read :)
I have been hearing a lot of bias concerning this topic and I am glad to now have a source with no bias
Thank you for this video. It seemed to cover both sides and the actual confirmed things very well. DFTBA
Trump Jr, Kushner and Manafort will all be indicted of collusion and this will make Trump's position untenable.\n\nPence assumes the presidency but the Republicans are wiped out in the 2020 election.
Great video! Very informative. Please keep us posted.
Kudos to you for tackling this topic.. and for doing with as little bias as possible. I waited a long while before watching this... the MSM has done its best to elicit emotion on this topic versus facts, and I am weary of it.
Even though I probably don't completely agree with you, I am very impressed that you put together a convincing and logical argument. I respect that, and thanks for being civil unlike many of us.
8:43 Oh, no John, I know how this is going to end. I resign the presidency of the United States of America, effective....
Does America meddle in other's elections? Or just Russia does it?
Look, Trump is MY President. It doesn't matter to me that Trump Jr. said he met with the Russians about adoption first and then it was supposedly about Clinton's whatever. He doesnt have to defend himself or his family. I know he is telling the truth. Everyone around him are liars except him and the fake news media can kiss his ass. And mine too. If his son knew, he would surely not tell his dad. #Trumpstupidfuckingcrook
I want more videos like this.
I do know that Hillary had sold A massive amount of uranium or to Russia but you liberals never bring that shit up. Hey OK she's too busy helping the kids her kids
Imagine if the DNC didn’t steal the election from Bernie considering he was beating everyone in the national polls
Loved it very well done !
CIA killed Kennedy and faked Boston bombing. Israel dual citizens and Mossad did 9/11 and have infiltrated CIA and FBI and all branches of government.
I'm hope trump and Putin are friends Russia is scary
Thanks for summing this up, ive been reading about it in the news forever but its hard to step back and put it all together. I don't blame Russia at all for doing whatever they could to avoid a clinton presidency though. She deserved that loss and more.
Are you a Sturgill Simpson fan? Look at the bottom right corner
It's funny seeing this after being shown the light of 3rd party's. Im just hearing this like Great, I love know russia meddled with the election for trump the same time the DNC corrupted the primary for Hillary. History books will remember the 2016 election as the year both parties cheated & we all got screwed... Doesn't help that Hillary's attacking people like Obama and Bernie in her book for losing.
I thought you guys were smart.
You forgot to mention Trump's appointments of cabinet members like Rex Tillerson, whose company was hoping to make a deal with Russia that would require getting rid of the sanctions first.
I would like your view on some things about this whole Polticial American Shit show with not just what was mentioned in your very enjoyable and informative video (as are your History Crash Courses) But what has happened after what was explained and to the more recent developments.\n \nFor it seems now Trump has made an enemy more than ever with Putin for the whole deal with equal amount of employees in each Embassy between the US and Russia, How Putin responded ( for what I read, he never actually got a reply thus he went forward to send US employees back home) and to where Trump closed down some major hub places for Russians in the US. From there, It seems Trump has now gone as far as -trying' to turn people against one another within this country (I.E #takeaknee) and now not only tarnish this country to the world, but antagonizing N. Korea.\nDo you believe he is doing all this because to try and draw attention away from the whole original scandal with Russia? To try and prove to his self-inflated ego that he is actually DOING the right things his way and believe this will make the American people 'believe' in his actions or...He is just very much a type of megalomaniac whom has no real grip of the reality of the situations as a whole? what do you theroize?
I feel like at the end of Trump's term we will find out this was all a large scale reality TV show and the parties are just warring fandoms.
Wait.... why am I seeing a Liverpool scarf, Wimbledon scarf and a Swindon plate in the back ground.
When the CNN anchor says that the Russia story is complete BS than you know that Russia actually had nothing to do with the election. Liberals still looking for stupid reasons to believe they hacked the entire election for trump to win 😂😂
The DNC email leak was an inside job. We should be investigating the murder of Seth Rich, not this half-witted speculation about Russian hackers.
Thanks for this video! I think this timeline might be helpful https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections
Political video and I get a Minecraft ad... great 👍
Let's not unfairly demonize Russia. All powerful states seek to advance their interests around the globe, often nefariously. The United States infamously worked to overthrow several democratically-elected governments in Central and South America in the 1980s and replace them with right-wing dictatorships using tactics that make Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election look pretty benign.
Americans complaining about other countries interfering with their elections. LOL.. the US interfere with 90% of countries' elections including Russia
why would you trust US intelligence when they provide no proof of their claim? even if they hacked the election that hack is just a leak of information that's been kept seceret; information that SHOULDVE been public.
He literally just reported facts. How is this triggering trump supporters. Shouldn't every American want justice? But (insert name here)- trump supporter response
YOU are a MSM Brain washed ZOMBIE!!
Did Russia hack the DNC and share with wikileaks?  I don't care, we should have had that info.

Great video!

Really nothing but know a lot about Hillery
The DOJ and the FBI is the executive branch, and the President is the boss of the DOJ and FBI,  it’s not a 4th branch of government.
Blah blah blah no evidence no crime just what if
This guy doesn't know that the FBI NEVER LOOKED AT THE DNC SERVER. \n\nThe DNC didn't hand over the server. They gave them a backup which was tampered by DNC tech firm CLOUD STRIKE.\n\nThe chain of evidence was broken in the DNC investigation. And there is ZERO evidence and NO INVESTIGATION into John Podesta's server.\n\nThis guy is lying.
there are major holes in all this information. I'd look to different sources.
2:00 On the point of there being an information imbalance, does that mean that what should have happened was Wikileaks, having been given the emails of the DNC showing collusion, corruption, and rigging of the primaries, should have not released that information to the voting public? Even if it wasn't fair to Clinton, arguing in favor of voter ignorance sounds very ethically wrong to me.
I would appreciate it if you could take your time checking out my gaming channel. Thank you.
I just started university and have only engaged in a little bit of groupthink so far. Will I be able to seriously watch this video or am I going to die from laughing at another YouTube pseudo intellectual who still thinks that the Russian narrative has legs?
Clickbait emo girl book writing white dude.
Election influence or none, the Democrats can't win a campaign if a large subset of their voting base feels like they don't stand for anything. We aren't right wing isn't a fucking platform on which to run our government, and people have had enough of the meaningless platitudes. They chose the establishment candidate over the potential populist candidate and paid the price for it. Like it or not, American politics currently runs on waves of inspiration and temporary invigoration, and democrats chose the candidate that was most likely to stymie that excitement. Pointing out evidence of Russia fucking with our political system is indeed important, but there's only so much you can say before you're forced to acknowledge all the self-inflicted wounds present on the body of the DNC.
IN 2012 THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED!!!!
This was a great piece. And now the Putinbots have arrived.

hi supercell! we are glad to see that supercell. has been giving many updates. I am also feeling well that supercell had released builder hall level 7 ,but I want to convey to you that, it's to boring to attack only using by our troops at builder hall. I want to say to you just, we want spells at builder hall so,  please supercell accept our request, and. think something about my sayings.
At 0:13 is that builder hall 8
Nice its all we are waiting for
This video is awesome and misleading. It's for builderhall level 8. At start of video you see 2 Guard Posts. At some point mid video we see level 8 Crusher and level 8 Firecrackers too.
Add a second builder!! It takes to long with just one
I hope they fix the matchmaking. I don’t want to be paired against bh7 as a bh6. Ima get recked every time. And I hate rushing
what about main village we stuck in 11 for ages
I like it ... sub
Where is the main village update supercell.. Getting bored with the main village.. CLASH ON ✌️✌️
Important update we cant have fun in bh base if we dont have friendly battles add it please,  also balance the match up we hate matching with max troops its annoying
You can find builder hall 8 and its upgrades in the vid
Plz help me my 511 gems has disappeared how no one used it

I always wanted to play this game on my channel!
Nice girlfriend in the background
Cats?? Do you have any cats??
i was amazed at what that chef can do his a food genius
The chef is french ?
TURN DOWN FOR WHAT
I sweat to god i am going there one day! I NEED THAT FOOD IN MY LIFE!!
I always wanted to go singapore, i will have to plan a visit there very soon.  What an amazing food
Why can we not taste the food yet!? I mean c'mon [insert  company here] it's 2017!
So the cannibal version of this restaurant would be called head to toe.
Ice cream like a 65%
Why does he have the pepper up his nose on the link to click the video. Fail
I've eaten a whole animal before!\n\n\n\n\nI'm not even a teen yet...
Ha ha from asshole to appetite.  Love the background music.  Have you tried oxtail stew or rocky mountian oysters. Maybe fish cheek and tongue...the cheeks taste like scallops.  Fish eggs/spon.?  My husband likes odd dishes. Real odd. He even eats groundhogs. YUK.  I have had raw clams.
The painting behind tho😶😂... You know he did that on purpose lol
I can't focus on mike's food, my eyes keep on looking at the picture behind mike kinda distracting
2:55 how do you have 3 hands?
Jackie chan trying out food never looked better 👌🏼
Mike literally anything and everything,  and I love it
I'm running down the list of noodle sauces that would go well with those pig skin noodles.  Something with a chili bean sauce and vinegar plus other goodies would go well with the texture of the pig skin.
2:56 how many hands does it take to cut a sausage?
That's it! I'm buying a ticket to Singapore
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiAq_SU0ED1C6vWFMnw8Ekg  guys check out the food ranger
When are you going back to Poland would love to see that
That all looked so could that I could cry.
Mikey what is the name of this restaurant?
Did you hit? She's offering...
This dude looks like that dude that is very famous and knows kong fu and he acts in movies
Who were with you?
hyep mike...\nplease do the review for this meal...\nDEATH LEVEL SPICY HOT POT SICHUAN, China
I liked the video... It was hard to watch his reactions since the painting of the woman with her legs spread wide open was a bit distracting....
This was intense. And that chef is next level. Mike gave him props unlike that unsocial psycho looking dude Mark Wiens. No offense!!
Oh chef dont wave your knife like that
Hearing Bob Seagar in the backround was so sad!
Can we have les subtitles for those of us who can't understand le chef's accent?
And i'm over here, eating oranges.....
OMG...Pig skin Noodles!!! Crispy Tripe!!! I've booked my flight to Singapore just for those 2 things. :)
1.  We get to see Mike's 'O' face.\n2.  Bob Seeger is still popular in Singapore.  ;-)\n\nLooks like a good time.
Only me noticing the third hand at 2:56 ? xd
The joy in his expression when he eats...better than Andrew Zimmerman.
I want to know if you ate everything yourself or someone else is there to share with you.  That is a lot of food for one person.
Dang.Those editing skills are on point!
Hey chefs, imagine having all customers you get are just like mike
omg that place looked amazing. I want that pig skin pasta <3
Are you stuck in Singapore?
This guy has the best job in the world
Rubik's Cube of Flavor.. love the analogy!
You are living my dream life! 😭
The dirt in the chefs nails. 10:12 🤢
Must go and try this feast today evening.🤤🤤🤤
Legend has it\nHe is still looking for that spicy pepper
Ok so i am lying .... only the best parts of any food animal or food product was used in this video..... literally
That seemingly illogical fork shaking is the most logical action when eating such a course hahaha. WOW
Just cut it with a S p o o n
Mike u always wear polo tees to restaraunts ..u should see if a clothing apparel will sponsor suits for the restaurants u go to
Try romanian cousine, I think you will love it 😉
I need that bone marrow in my life...
hi Mike, do you ask people permission for filming, just wondering xD
Now you've done it. I'm officially gonna rework my plans for a trip Japan to somehow incorporate a detour to Singapore. Even when I can't stand the climate, after watching all these videos about the food I just have to go. Singapore seems to be the ultimate food lovers paradise...\n\nEven when some of the dishes you had here might not sound that appealing to most western people, just looking at it made my mouth water....
French chef and really knows what he's at
2:57, where's that other fork from??? Three cutlery?????
Just added this restaurant to my bucket list!!!!!!
the intro song is lit
That place is overprice and doesn't look tasty but nice creation is all I see
how much was all of that?
The video ending on 11:11 made me so happy
2:56 Mike has 3 hands ????
Absolutely sadistic
When you try omad but dumpling uploads...
ill stick with real food.....Mcdonalds!!!
whoa its #36 US trending
All too fancy Mikey....
Cassio though
That ox check and bone marrow looked so yummy!
NUMBER 35 ON TRENDING
Gross
Have you ever tried menudo
food looks fantastic
Mike looks like\n\n\n\n\nMike 😂
This place looks super awesome
D-did something JUST BEAT butter?!
You have to try that slice of lardo in a still hot char grilled slice of durum wheat bread.
horrible to watch you eat.. you have a knife to cut the food... its just disgusting and very impolite to break the food with the work
Wait Mike has been to poland😲POLSKA
That chef is amazing..
pls morebrestaurants should reach out to mike so he can show us the world of food and flavor! great episode
what is the music in the beginning of the video?
Mikey's videos always makes me happy :).
I thought you said you do not do reviews of the restaurant offers? Well I hope it was good.
Looks so good and unique!! I wanna go try!!
Wow. That place looks amazing.\n\nP.S. Mikey, when are you gonna go to China?
is that a Loli in the background on the wall? :D
The spice is life!
The only sauce too hot for mike
How come you only showed some of the prices?
Isn't that chicken rice chilli
That place looks soooo expensive :(
God i love bone marrow
if you like honey comb tripe you would love Mexican menudo
Delicious,tasty 👍👍👍
My gosh, everything just looks so delicious!!
Cool moment should have been aired a part of Raw
So braun wants a shot at the cruiserweight title o.o
I so crying to Enzo
When you're the champ but still get buried.
What has happened? Is enzo a bad guy?
wow that was over kill for a post match rough up
why did they do that to enzo? what's his fault?
Enzo Amore deserved every bit of this beating. This is what happens when you disrespect the Cruiserweight division.
Thought I was watching 'The Passion of The Christ' for a second there.
nexus 2.0 was cm punk's nexus so this would be 3.0
Props for Enzo taking TWO spins (he had to call Gulak to stop and couldn't even see straight) and letting the cruiserweights do their finishers/signatures on him. Surprised he didn't even throw up after the spins, I sure would have. You can even hear the ref ask him if he was okay and he says Yup! ROFL
How does he already have the blue suede 5s!!!!
What did he do to deserve this
Try Not to Get Satisfied Challenge WWE Version
Enzo must've said something about HHH under his breath. Turned him into a jobber with a belt. This is not cool.
What is this the new new nexus
Enzo Amore got what he deserved, a hell of a beating from the whole 205 Live plus Braun Strowman! HAHAHAHA
Storyline wise he deserved it. Did any of you idiots see the segment on RAW?
this looks like an office Christmas party gone awry
whos the guy in the suit?
Damn they really don't like enzo bro lol
Akira was the only one who could throw a decent punch lol
Enzo took a beatin' , and still is great !! Dude is very Charismatic , and Smart , he deserves to be Champion !!
After watching this......I predict the WWF in 10 years will be no longer.
What do we have here a couple haters
That's crazy they really jumping him
This is what happens when you act like an idiot backstage
I don't get why Strowman would come out? Can anyone explain?
Counter productive TV. All your babyfaces just became heels. All to punish Enzo for backstage heat from months ago.
worst champion ever in wwe history
Everyone in there attires except Gallagher and someone else who's supporting a suit
3:08 Did i leave the AC running at my house hmm......
I like how he winked. Just to show, he's okay and this is fake.. Hehe. 3:12
And at 3:01 Turn my head to the left?to which dude replies Just stay there. You're good. 
I see Cass and Enzo coming back together
I hate the crusiweights now
A part of me is happiness
So i guess everyone on 205 live is heel accept enzo what on earth
I was hoping Connor McGregor entered that ring and fooked up enzo as well 😂
Braun is going after Enzo's CW Title
It's so weird being fan of WWE and UFC
God some of yall are soft asf this is wwe stop being so butthurt....
Now I feel kinda bad for Enzo
Like the assassination of Caesar.
Strowman and Neville are going to be a tag team, every tag team hurt but champs, plus strowman been fighting Rollins and Ambrose, this week and next
Where's big class when you need him? This is the shittiest feeling when your all alone and No one will save you
Big Cass is going to come back to help him
This kinda reminds of when the divas were competing in a match only for Kharma to come out and break down.
I hate Braun Strowman  (Sry if I'm offending u) he just sticks his nose in everyone's business. He has a problem with everyone
One of the greatest moments on RAW I've ever seen. Enzo is an embarrassment of Cruiserweight Division or even WWE. It's good to see the 205 rosters punishing him for their greatness of the division.
Clearly this was done becAuse someone in WWE personally doesn't like Enzo. \n\nClassic hate disguised in the form of entertainment and I know Enzo feels the same.
enzo might might not be the best but he the crusierweight champion
wow that was awesome now I start liking cruiserweight division
it's not funny..
This symbolizes art in its purest form. Truly beautiful!
2:40 anybody else Heard him say jump to enzo
According to wrestling logic, Enzo is dead.
First ever i saw in wwe . What a memorable moment for Enzo 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
It doesn't matter how you win in a wrestling match it's WWE get real you don't like it Lee's WWE😠
This is literally the best thing I've seen from WWE in a long time, it's that great.
Talk about bringing the shovels
Cockroach EZNO
Wwe gangbang😂
is enzo alive ??
Enzo deserves more
pobre enzoooo
Finally
The entire cruiserweight roster just turned heel... :/
Braun is a cruiserweight
WWE really dislikes Enzo. .
Enzo is dead lmao
Po mano\nTadinho do Enzo\nEle é dahora
Hijo de puta braun strowman y los peso cruserp
RIP Hip Hop Hobbit.
RIP enzo amore
Enzo is awesome
r u killin him???
How Enzo doin?
Kangana ne hritik ko rulaya..\nhttps://youtu.be/jZfIhr669EU
Enzo died rofl
Thats wrong what day did to enzo #sleepinonenzo
3:15 he blinked... how cute.
Rip Enzo
Lol no flying zone
#WorkplaceBullying
3:07 lol
thanks for that
I just liked strowman
Has God answered our prayers?
Thank You! 😊
Enzo ajobber.
Cedrick and gran metalik were his friends
Yep just teach kids how to bully helpless ones.
god i love vince lol
The Public Hazing of Enzo Amore
Freak the whole cruisweight divison
Perfecto
Podría ver esto todo el día
Se violaron a enzo  me pregunto cuanto le pagaran por aguantar todo eso
Enzo might have pissed off Vince bad - the reason he is receiving the beating of his lifetime from straight 3 months every week. He definitely should leave WWE for good.
Animal agriculture takes _far_ more land and plant agriculture to support it, than it would take to feed humans directly on plant agriculture alone. Stop supporting the needless killing and exploitation of billions of sentient creatures. Stop being cold hearted and illogical.
How to separate the separate plants? Giant wheat harvesting machines that we have will just mash up the tomatoes? Who likes ketchup flavored bread anyone?
Everybody switch agriculture now, or Geordie LaForge and Seven of Nine will starve in the future! O teh noes!
0:32\n\nSo, sea levels might NOT be rising because of arctic melting, but us humans pumping the water out of the soil?
Who the fuck cares what happens 10 thousand years from now we dead let them figure it out no need to waste money and funds while I say a lot hole is more important to fill than this
Like to eat? Like easy access to food in your supermarket? Most of the civilized world has no idea how farming practices really work. \nWe have to create bigger end bigger farms, and not just to produce more, but because the profit margin is so insanely small. \nA lot of people are loving labels on their food like pesticide free, or GMO Free. They fail to realize that these are the technological advances that make farming more efficient. Did you know that more often that not, the fat off of an animal raised Grass-fed or free range has yellow fat, not the normal white. But we can't market that meat, because nobody will buy it. It looks different than what they're used to. I grew up on a ranch/farm. We grow our own hay to feed our own cattle and milk goats. I am studying Ag Science in college now, and learning why theses huge corporations are pushing out the small farmers. It's because a business has to be that big to make any profit.
How.. i'm asking what's your plan..?
I hate when farms farm the land sooo much that the land vanishes.....because it's not a renewable recource.....like water that  does it's whole precipitation thing.....wait....the water also completely vanishes when when they farm too?! What will we do when all the water disappears and the ground is all gone....I'm assuming we'll just drift into space.
Perhaps the problems with modern farming exist because we already tried to fix farming. If it worked for 10,000 years then why is it now broken? Did anybody live back then to actually verify that it always has been broken?  SEE People... this video is what you would call propaganda to try to convince you that MUTATED (cleverly labeled GMO) food is the solution.... Don't buy it!!! The planet was perfect until we tried to modernize it. It's only going to make it worse.
Just remember this channels partner channel minutephysics just made a funding appeal for those scam particle accelerator assisted solar films manufacturing technology...\n\nOnce a liar always a liar, I'm a sucker for ethical practices so I felt the urge to comment please ignore if you are offended or type a cuss word down below... Thanks and peace
I think that, while this is a valuable and worthwhile approach/solution, our long term sustainability as a species is going to end up more focused on hydroponics and lab meat. I think it's simply a matter of scaling, and of considering the technologies which will almost certainly be available to us in the relative near future.
hi this is Kate *ears immediately bleed* STOP putting her on. that voice is like forks on a plate, nails on a chalkboard, Styrofoam, you name it!
This is dumb. so your saying to mix random long lasting flowers with wheat to make the soil last longer? thats just more work for farmers who have to selectively harvest just the wheat and not get the random shit mixed in the harvest
do you live on a farm?\nwe have a lot of trees, fruit trees, that drop fruit, have birds, birds that nest out here, eat the fruit, make droppings, we cut the grass, cut the hay, harvest the hay, or let the cows eat the grass or hay, they make droppings, return the nutrients back into the soil, the rain washes the nutrients into the soil, replenishes the water for the fruit trees and birds, and so on and so on.\nwhoever wrote this crap must not live on a farm, or know nothing about farming, cultivating, harvesting,  conservation, rain harvesting, or any kind of procedures needed to maintain our land.\ngoogle this, and think about what you're going to put on a video......
Ancient humans were using permaculture approaches like this to sculpt the amazon rainforest for thousands of years, this is not an inherently futuristic approach
Kate buy a farm and show us how it's done . I'll guarantee your lazy ass wouldn't last a day. Liberals.
All these meme comments. I love it.
Can this mix of farming and hunting and gathering feed billions of people?
Aquaponics is the future. Maybe, unless its not. Then ignore me.
Monsanto is the worst thing ever...
Will/is there a video about hydroponics? Since they use insanely less water and don't need any or as much soil they seem like a way to go forward. Also you can stack them in skyrises making food travel shorter in citys and the plants you grow can add to the CO2 collection as a bonus :)
per·ma·cul·ture\nˈpərməˌkəlCHər/Submit\nnoun\nthe development of agricultural ecosystems intended to be sustainable and self-sufficient.
We are losing dirt?😂😂 this is all bs. Tree hugger
We need to get rid of the overpopulated planet. We can start by genociding Africa.
1:47 I don't see how this would work long term because in monoculture pests grew in numbers each year because it's host plant (source of it's food) is available to them all year, every year (and by year 3 there are so many of them that crops have to be plowed/removed). That is why crop rotation is invented. So that the same plant would be grown every 4th year so that the pests have it's source of food (host plant) once in every 4 years (next generation of pests starves and cannot produce off-springs in large numbers).\nWhat you are saying in the video is, by my opinion, doable only if there were only 1 billion people in the world or maybe even less.
Well...since the fundamental bottleneck for all manipulation of matter is energy, we COULD scream wildly and constantly about pouring money and minds into fusion, which, if it fulfills half its promised potential, would make tending to such concerns exceedingly trivial.
Cattle used to roam over large areas, the area became reduced over time and they are now confined to tiny spaces from birth to death, mass milking and slaughtering. Anyway, cattle would keep soil fertile and good for worms and microbes through dung and trampling. Ecosystems inevitably fail when such things are no longer happening.
The s in your speech is like a whistle and hurts my ears. I'm gonna unsubscribe because of that! Fix your microphone.
Don't worry the NFL will take a knee to fix your problem.
Try working 80 hours a week breaking your back trying to feed all these people who sit around doing next to nothing all day, then tell me farming is broken
Then stop eating animals and save land and resources!
Replicating natural self sustaining systems already exists in farming, its called permaculture. But we're never going to see massive permaculture farms unless we stop subsidizing things like corn and subsidize the initial setup of these natural systems instead.
If farming was ALWAYS broken then nobody would have been left alive to make this dippy video.  The Agricultural revolution was 12,000 years ago.   Does that sound broke?
Who actually plows anymore it's all no plow
Wasn't broken.quit popping out kids an stop using chemicals.
This channel is a vegan propaganda machine.
Geordie and Seven of nine! lol
Or get rid of a couple billion people.
It was so hard listening to the 15 year old narrate. Not like it matters. It just sounds like typical millennial  blabbering
Also, like most things, these issues can also be helped by having less people to require so much food.
ok but you forgot to mention everyone should go vegan.
I love this idea
A kid costs like $100,000 from 0 to 18 years so use free porn like me, it's free like youtube
damn, my house has plenty of biodiversity in it, I don't even have to go out to buy vegetables
Ha growing crops along side native vegetation lol Obviously you've never tried harvesting a field that's filled with lots of weeds and other pesky plants that aren't wanted and only cause issues, have fun plugging up your header and beater cylinder , if you even know what those things are smh
THIS VIDEO IS BOMB! Also, more and more people should switch to a high fat low carb diet and thus switch to pasture and animal husbandry as their source of food. Huge potential for pastures and high animal product based diets. Pastures can be their own little ecosystem.\n\nThis idea sounds cool too though. For those that just CANNOT give up those unhealthy whole grains.
that moose head big ass hell
I'm a farmer and you know jack shit about farming.
Perm crops won't work with the current system because of seeds. Companies own them, the dna of them, and sell them every year to farmers who aren't allowed to collect seeds from the crop but have to rebuy them from the company again. These companies won't want to give up a yearly cash flow by having farmers perhaps go many years between purchases.
Masanobu Fukuoka and many others have already been preaching this kind of farming for the last 50 years... nothing futuristic about it. We (the western world) just forgot that nature gives us everything we need to survive if we allow it to be itself.
As a bio major and agriculture minor this shit blew my mind. Wat a smart and innovative way to recycle nature by introducing natural elements. I will own a farm and I will implement this.
How about in-house farming?\nIt's alot better option
This will drive up veggie and fruit prices even more.
Only way this works is if all other jobs become automated and every family owns a few acres of land to grow their own food on. Harvesting food in this system is incredibly labor intensive or uses machines that are still in prototype phases that have a starting cost around a million dollars. Also if wild animals are going to be roaming around where you're going your food, you will have significantly less food, unless you have some really good fences. The current system is flawed for sure, no one would argue it isn't, but this will not be a viable solution in our lifetime.
Why not just kill off four or five billion people?  This hippie nonsense won't be able to raise enough food to feed the current population let alone any increase over the next 500 years.  The same with hydroponics.  You simply cannot raise enough food to feed the world's population.  Don't get me started on the amount of energy required to run a hydroponics farm.  \n\nThe bottom line is always the bottom line.  Modern farming methods were resisted by oldtimers until it was shown to increase a farmer's profit each and every year.  Why doesn't this Land Institute just start their method of farming and prove that a) it can raise enough food and b) is profitable for the farmer?  Farming is hard work.  The people that whine about paying a McDonald's unskilled employee $15 an hour seem to forget that the people that feed us deserve to make a decent profit to compensate them for that labor.  I seriously doubt they can back up their talk with real performance.
This alternative method won't feed the current amount of human without a massive die off. A species die off is the first step to Extinction. Last time I've checked, extinction doesn't work out so well for anyone or thing.
LOL are any of you farmers? Lets be real here, farmers are in it for one thing, and that is money! Lots of Crops = Lots of Money! So by making perennial plants grow side by side to somthing means a smaller yeild which means less money which means that no farmers will join in on this. I understand our resources are depeleting and I would know since i live above the ogalla aquifer, but money is everything and only government regulation can stop the farmers. But then here comes the corruption of representatives and how they will not pass a law like that because they are getting their money and support from big farming companies and guilds. We have a problem, but this problem spans across many things to which out weigh this one, even though it may not....
It's staggering to think that we use herbicides to control weeds when we have so many unemployed people in the world.  We could just use people to pull weeds and avoid herbicides altogether.  The price of food would rise, but that's a good thing; our economy should be dominated by things that people actually need, rather than by useless crap.
So farming's not broken? Seems we continue to adapt as necessary and are continuing to do so.
There you can see a nice example here in Brazil.\nhttps://youtu.be/C7h-JbaJjn4
So what you're saying is that in the destruction of the Earth, farming is too OP and needs to be nerfed in the next patch.
Hydroponics and aquaculture may well be our future. Early adopters have shown that the yields per acre skyrocket when those technologies are used, and the variety of foods do as well. Several early adopters have turned buildings like old warehouses into urban farms rather efficiently.
Gee, how about living within the available resources instead of constantly trying to game it. Like maybe LESS people?
The ground is only one level. Farming skyscrapers would be pretty cool
Yeah, sorry, to do that we'd have to bowl over a few third world countries and kill off a few billion third worlders... I have no problem with that though. NOT EVERYONE CAN EAT! Face it.
We also were doing better when we give fields a year off by rotating between fields. There are reasons God told the Israeli to farm that way to allow the nutrients to be replenished.
Farming needs be nerfed In the next update
Sadly this will be slow to take hold. Seed companies have no incentive for perennial plants as they make their profit selling seed every year (same reason why brown bagging is discouraged and sometimes sued over. Hopefully publicly funded research will pave the way (or somebody finds a way to make sustainable profit marketing such without owning the farm too).
I'm very glad that someone understands that Genetic Modification is not harmful; it's a tool with great potential
This is a bunch of liberal crap omg
This science is what Indiana University and Perdu focus their science programs on. Give them money for research.
Your „future of farming“ occupies way too much space. In times where the human population grows and grows and there’s more and more mouths to feed, your space requiring farming seems highly unlikely to save the future.
How are you going to harvest corn and wheat with all these other crops in between? Even if you strip crop the different crops so you can mechanically harvest, the government needs to supplement the growers accordingly via acreage lost in the different crops planted.
You mean the food at Walmart doesn't just magically appear there holy shit
you're talking about permaculture without using the name. a simple system would be cows, chickens and grass. the cows eat the grass and leave poop on the ground a few days later the chickens are brought to the same field where they dig out the maggots that are now in the cow poop spreading it around and eat the maggots and leave more poop. the grass grows like crazy and a week or so later the process repeats. the input from the farmer is moving the animals and some water (which may be naturally available near or shipped in. there are much more complex systems involving several to a few dozen plants and animals, but the concept is the same let the waste of one process feed the next in the chain.
It’s a major contributor to global warming.
Why is this woman presenting a video about science? All science shows should be presented by men  smh.
GMOs are a useless toxin that jack us and the animals that eat them up, they don't even increase the yields. Just another part of the stupid monoculture system that requires poisoning the plants and us. The solution, perhaps, return to the tried and true, better yields, healthier you, and the land can sustain itself.
why don't we recycle our feces ?? how hard is recycling anyway ??\nwe just have to collect sewage, boil it, dry it, and sell it as fertilizer.\nI can be 100% wrong, but that's my impression or recycling stuff.
you want a solution to the food/population problem???    *how about stop paying the bottom 25% of our collective iq aggregate to reproduce like rabbits, at the expense of the rest of the 75% _combined!*

People pretend as if overpopulation is not a problem. But it is the sheer masses of humans we have now, not the birth rate, that causes concerns such as the one in this video. A population of 7.6 billion is simply not sustainable!
Soylent Green. There, I said it.
Is it just me? Whenever I hear a British person say khaki I think they're saying car key at first.Anyway such lovely style.
Am I colourblind or is that sweater just grey (not mint)
The outfit is bloody gorgeous...but I'm 28 with the average 28yo lifestyle and there is no way I could spend over £400 on one outfit 😩😩 can autumn also come with a pay rise please?!
I loved the look but the video seemed to be a bit too staged and scripted for my liking. Anyways, I know this is your job and you 'have' and want to make those videos from time to time! I prefer your chatty GRWMs or vlogs though.\nkeep up the good work!
I really like how adventurous you went with your eye look, I too usually keep it simple but I definitely want to give some green a go now! Your hair looks incredible and I loved the outfit! Thanks for sharing, much love 💜 x
Lily nowadays only makes makeup a point in her videos when it's an AD.. its sad because you can tell this look is not her, its created for a purpose and she wouldn t wear it otherwise. Love her true everyday looks in vlogs.
Do youtubers not need to place '#AD' in the title anymore?
Looks too much like an add
This is a different outfit for you but it looked great! You should definitely try something different more often! You should put a photo on instagram too as I feel you didn't show the outfit as a whole for long enough and it deserves some air time ☺️ xxx
This is amazing - I love your fall eyeshadow colour and that cute mini skirt.
Love the outfit, you look fab!
As you started to put on green eyeliner I was worried it won't look good, but girl, it looks amazing!
I love the outfit! You've really become one of the people I look to for style inspiration :)
Such a lovely video ❤ and Lily you ROCK this look👌
I Ike how you added the green! Such a nice touch and your autumn outfit look was so cute!:)
Love the green eyeliner, it really is so beautiful on brown eyes! Ah I almost forgot about the Matte Balms, I used to be so obsessed with them!
You are awesome 😍. Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Really loving your hair Lily, it looks great. Also that skirt 😍
Love this outfit, you look really pretty on skirts and dresses. \n\nLove your videos! ❤
I loved this lily!! such a great video idea and love your style so much! :) also: I hope you are feeling a bit better! <3
I actually loved the makeup look, it suited you so well! Will definitely try on myself even though where I live it's spring time now.
I looove this makeup look on you. The green liner looks amazing.
Love love love this on you❤️
I loved this video! :) the outfit looks so nice on you..very flattering :) Can't wait for the autumn weather to get here ...\nI really enjoy your videos more and more lately ... especially your vlogs 😊💕
from watching this i've decided that I need that eye look in my life, also your hair looks SOOO nice!! just loved this video!!
You look beautiful! Wear more skirts and boots! Very nice Lily!!
The outfit is aces!! I’m inspired by it x
Omg this outfit is amazing!!! Definitely feel inspired!!!! 😍😍 the eye look is gorgeous as well - nice to see an autumnal look that isn't red and orange 💕
Great video Lily, love the way you did your makeup, hair and styling. The whole video was put together amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀
Really need to get my hands on a green liner, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. Well write anyway lol. Loving your whole outfit Lily x
i really like the green eyeliner, you look very sexy!
Really liked the outfit on you!!
Love all of this! I'm going to try that mascara, I love a tubing mascara.
I LOVE this outfit! That skirt is so cute, my friend was wearing a very similar one today and she looked stunning
love the boots and your make up is perfect Lily!
ooooh I LOOOVE the outfit it's different for you but so nice! Love it love it love it
Hi Lily, loved the format of this video and your outfit though different for you still reflected your own personal style. I remember watching the vlog when you were on your boot hunt last year and they look lovely on you! ❤️
You're making me want over the knee boots! I keep trying to convince myself I don't need any.
Your look is so simple but also very sophisticated. Big like for this new autumn combination in your wardrobe and in your makeup👌💗💗💗
The outfit looks bomb! Those colours are so flattering on you, love the mint/light brown combo
You look so good Lily! I love the eye look
I've been loving your videos lately, Lily. Your YouTube style is really evolving. X
Just wanna see you do a contoured highlight full American insta girl glam makeover video would be fun x
LOVE the look, especially the outfit! It's so simple and chic! I think you should add a simple gold necklace though to add something to the neckline :)
BEST I've ever seen you look. Beautiful!
Love the makeup, hair and the clothes 😍😍😍
love the outfit lily! reminds me of mint chocolate chip :D
Pretty outfit! I think the stripped shirt (you wore in the beginning) would also look nice with the suede skirt. :)
Great makeup look, Lily. I've got brown eyes too, and I used to love wearing green eyeshadow or liner, but I kind of forgot about it recently and have been playing it safe. You've inspired me to try something different!
Great eye makeup, and outfit. Feeling fall inspired.
Your style is amazing Lilly! ❤️❤️ Xx
Well done!! 👏👏It's like you're reading my mind. Before your video posted I've been contemplating the Charlotte Tilbury green eyeshadow quad! Now I'm inspired to try something new!! So excited!! Thanks Lily xx Danielle
Had to pause this video to transform my mane into effortless Lily hair... at least that's what I'm calling it! 😂 Thanks Lily and Anna for the styling tips. x
Lily where is your stripy shirt from? Didn't find it in the description box
Loved the outfit and the eyes...
I remember loving those over the knee boots that I still remember the brand they're from till this very day 😂
Love this eye-look on you, Lily!! The liner spiced things up, but it's still kinda neutral :)
Those boots!!!!  Love them!
Love this look xx
Another inspiring video! TFS!
Wow! You look fabulous!
That green liner!! love love love
Your make-up looks lovely! Xxxx
That mascara really elongated your lashes.
This outfit suits you sooo much 😍😍😍
Great Style! (:
mmm I was drawn by the title. Thought it'd be a fashion video but it is more about makeup. Anyhow your outfit is cute!
If you were on a TV commercial literally doing the same video I doubt anyone would hate on it. Honestly what's the difference between that and this? Silly folks. Cool video, loved the outfits. Tried to recreate the grungy eye...total YouTube fail for me, (I'm a Pinterest fail professional) but I'll keep trying. :) Cheers from Detroit.
🌹Please update what is in my bag thank you💋
Went to the launch of the new Olympus camera in Cape Town and meantioned how you were the reason I fell in love with the camera and brand. Was great playing with the new Mark 3 so thank you!
I'm loving your hair longer!!! Also love this outfit xxx
Your hair looks amaze!
This is like my fave makeup look you've ever done and outfit you've ever worn!!! X
Great look!!  Thanks for sharing it with us!
This has made me feel so cosy and ready for autumn xx
Lily you look so pretty...love you make up
More make up and autumn outfits, please!
cute outfit! I like when you try new things! it's exciting
I need to know your nail polish. Loved it!
I loved your video, makeup and outfit!
Really Love ALL the outfit and make up look ! Really inspiring 💖
Lily never realised how banging your legs are you need to get them out more often! Great video loved the look xx
Looooove this stile of video! Super cozy warm outfit, lovely interesting makeup, you're so cute Lily)
I love the outfit x
Adore this Lilly! Your make up looks beautiful! 💕👌🏼
Fabulous video Lily! Loved your eye make up. So ready for Autumn, boots, scarves, hot chocolate and sitting by the fire. 😊
Love it!!!  💕 You're definitely on point!   Btw I have that mascara but with pink lid (?) and I love it!
Loved the makeup and the outfit! But I wish there was a full body shot, it really helps me see the complete look .come together
Really loved this video. Love it when you do makeup & style content. More please! I’m gonna try the green eyeliner- who knew!
Love this look! Really suits you ;). And I'm dying or the 70s inspired fall fashion atm
LOVE this outfit and I'm definitely going to try some smudgy green eyeliner now!
OMG that outfit was sooo amazing and autumnal !😍I was  impatiently waiting for it to see how the pieces would go with one another,and I loved it!❤️That skirt!😭
Thumbs up for this video Lily and yes the outfit really works on you ~ love it!
LOVE your skirt! You have lovely Autumn style, Lily! Xoxo, Caylie
Usually I don't relate to fall looks, as I wear quite natural makeup, but I'll totally try this makeup look. Love your style in makeup and fashion ❤
You should definitely wear that green eyeliner more often, it really suits you and enhances your eyes. I love everything from this video!
Gave it a like before the video even ended! Loved everything about it :)
Adore this style of video!! X
Where's the top that you're wearing during the chatty part of the video from? I need some more basics in my wardrobe and if you have it it must be nice ❤️
Ahhhhhhhhhh I've tried curling my hair like that using straighteners and every time I fail.   Do you put product on to hold the curl?  \nI must be twisting it wrong or too quickly.  😢

What would you do for a Klondike bar?
Does anybody actually think the iPhone x is worth it or good
First time ever i have seen u wearing Apple watch and trust me it suits on uh.\nNow u r down i guess so in the world if smartwatches??
Very disappointed that there wasn't a LG V20 pun
It's like comparing a garbage can to a dumpster
I was thinking of getting the iPhone X but... I really thought about it and I will wait! Anyway I wasn’t probably going to get it right away I’d have to wait months for it, but I’ll wait till they come our with a bigger screen version and a gold colors, that’s if they do, if not I’d still get it but I’d wait for the second gen. I have the 7plus so I’m good for now
@marquesbrownlee, you got to send me that iPhone 8plus
when are the giveaways starting?
So the title is really just click bait
Ok yall I'm coming from a S7 but I kinda wanna switch over so should I just stick to what I know n get a note 8 or wait till the iPhone x(By the way this will be my first iphone)
I’m trying to work with a disabled person for tech review products for people with a disability or international products that provide that we don’t know about in the USA.

He just casually leaves a Nvidia Quadro gpu on the table lol
face ID is the worse thing ever, heres why, lets say a cop stops you in the street and he snatches your phone for no reason and hand cuffs you, all he has to do to violate your 4th amendment is turn the phone on and point it at your face and now he can go throw all your private anything
Maybe just purchase a 7 and call it a day.
If the iPhone 5 series (5c excluded, SE included) is the best iPhone design ever, the iPhone 4 from 2010 is the most influential phone design for this decade.
That ribbon on the tv behind MKBHD triggers me so hard
Please continue the monthly ask MKBHD through 2017 😫😫😫😫
He looks like he is lip syncing
Sick of Apple, sick of Apple, don't care, don't care. Next topic.
wireless charging a car sounds good, but the fact that through induction charging you still get like only 1/10 of the current that passes the source seems wasteful.
Tesla is already working on wireless charging, the floor would be a special type of charger and your car just goes over it, and it charges. but of course, not as efficiently as plug charging
Idk what apple was thinking, I hate correcting those people who just refuse to say X right
Hey mkbhd, can u make a review of the Moto x4 when it comes out?
Does the iPhone x have a headphone jack
#20... almost 1 year after the LG V20 was released... lol
I'm here watching V20 on my V20
Wouldn't it be great if Marques 2nd channel would be a meme channel where he just randomly fucks around?
Are you going to talk about the damn phone or just blabber your mouth ?
Actually touch ID would be much harder to trick in face ID. People have identical twins for a start and that's just if I'm being ultra realistic there's also the theory that everybody has a doppleganger so assuming your doppelganger looked at your phone it'd be easy access. However literally every single person on the planet has a different set of fingerprints. Bus Touch ID is much more reliable than face ID
Always love and trust your videos.  Once again Great Job!
BMW are already making a car wireless charger
I say iPhone X should have a special multiply edition with Ed Sheeran's face on it.
Can I see some ultimate frisbee skills?
got the iphone 8... amazinnng.  also got a lumiy lightblade lamp for ease of charging with its port... amazinnng tooo.
iPhone X all the way!!
In Norway we got big ferry’s that is wireless charging
What do you personally think about the whole apple fanboy vs android fanboy thing?
you're right about the space grey 👍
Alien fingers. BAck @ it again
Got the 8 Plus launch day and couldn't be happier. I'll let Apple work out the kinks on the X with Face ID etc and upgrade to the XI? next year.
apple releases notch with controversial design, baits people to buy it for $1000 then removes notch next year and makes people re-buy for $1000
Do you still use your bose qc 35s?
Hi Marques. Do you ever do Frisbee stuff these days. I loved all that when I was in college (late 1970s) and I miss it now.  I hope you still do - sometimes.
That pc wallpaper!!! Pls make one for android!!! ☺
Listening this on beats solo 3 u sound really crisp \nGod bless love from india 🇮🇳
Wireless charging on cars? Really? And what if I want to drive my car while it’s charging?
CubbyHD? Is that what you're saying because I can't tell, I thought your name was Marques lol
iPhone X vs iPhone 10: Which is better?
Damn, his hands are big af
It's not gonna be REACHGATE it is now bud haha
I have wireless charging on my Volt, and the same brand (Plugless) makes stuff for Tesla actually. I like mine, but of course I'm not sure how it works on a Tesla. I'm in NH, you can come film at my house if you want :)
How about instead of being a brainwashed consumer and dropping $1,000 on a phone that will quickly become obsolete you spend it on something more practical.
R E A C H G A T E
Why ever video you make about iPhone and Samsung phones are nice and we should be them? iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is bs and feels cheap “nobody should neither one of them”!!! Plus iPhone 6-8 are the same phones only difference “it’s a little faster” I’m a iPhone person

Start this out by saying I've been a long time follower.  Great what you do...\n\nBUT\nYour video delivery model seems to have slowed way down. I'm sorry to say that I no longer come to you to review a phone because 10 people seem to have reviewed it before you. Are you going to release some of the phone reviews of phones that have been released recently?  Is there another channel for just reviews that you can point me to ? QA is great but I am still waiting for you to drop the V30, note 8 etc. Its cool you're doing well, nice to look at life through your lens but I just want the reviews. I can not buy a 15k tv, I can't buy a Tesla. Idk maybe I'm the old guy (31) just looking for the original stuff that you do.
Wireless charging for ones personal spacecrafts from habitats orbiting the sun - energy delivery via gamma lasers aka grasers

Glad you converted Fahrenheit to celsius for your Indian fans 😁
I love this guy’s job, all day messing up with the latest on technology, beautiful office, god I hate my life.
BMW just recently introduced wireless charging for their hybrids, but a hybrid also doesn't need to charge as much as a full electic car :)
None said anything about the Value Pricing strategy of Mr. Tim Cook. Seems all of you're going all in for the X (or 10 whatever that's called) :3
MKBHD V30 might come out earlier then the LG V30
the 'no bezel' design means the iPhone X is closer to the iPhone 8 than the Plus despite its large screen,
went from iPhone to Droid 3 days ago, wanted to feel a real tech progression and I feel Apple is always catching up now and even still using old tech vs Samsung. iOS is still very nice but I did not want to feel I overpaid for underpower tech simply for a logo. I had a Droid 5 years ago, why I left. I can safely say Droid has come a looooooong way. OMG I am glad I switched. TO be fair the only reason I did was Best Buy was selling the S7 Edge for half off to kill inventory for the s8, being iPhone 8 is catching up to S7, I feel the upgrade and still the Edge out does the iPhone 8. iOS optimized like mad, I notice it but man, Samsung does it right. Very happy and saved like $500 from iPhone.
I don't really understand your point on wireless charging. It sounds like your making an excuse for tesla. Wireless charging is here, people use it and the other manufacturers are offering it in their cars. Tesla is just late to the game on this one.
Oh, and how do you blur out the background? Thanks man.
are you willing to give your iphone 7.... because karma :)
should I get the 8 or the 8 plus?
Awesome point about space gray. I think that it is typical bad marketing to tweak a branded item until it is no longer in the original brand specs.

If he gets through the live rounds he’s gonna win
I would have picked Blake. Congrats on making it 💕💕
why os this 14 on trending... like he is quite good but still....
Daddy's behind at 3:03 - 3:04
It's cute and all, but his voice really isn't the best. I've heard other singers who sound just like him. I feel like his popularity is what's gonna get him far in this competition instead of his actual voice.
I knew him before this
The most boring audition is the one trending. Wtf
I like this song, but terrible for an audition
Omg I love listening to him and his adorable daughter when they're on Ellen. I got excited when I heard he was going to be on here. I hope he makes it far.
Yay Seattle!!!\nOh and I love that little angel 😇 \nGo David!!
2M views in 2 days? Are you kidding me? Dave (and Claire) are made whether or not he wins The Voice.
That little girl looks like chucky the doll
I hope that little girl doesn't turn into Miley.
The sweetest thing to come to the voice!
The little girl looks like Sofia Richie
the cute little girl reaction is everything ♡☆
White guy with guitar with an absolutely mediocre voice. I don't get it. Nothing special at all here.
why do feel like this is all fixed, and not real? like seems way to staged, actor point of view
Something's telling me they are going to win the entire thing...I mean like Brooke is good and all, but this dude and his family has more impact on society and is much more relatable! The tripple difference of views between Brooke's and his audition is a solid proof of that!
This guy is an awesome. Even when he plays and sings with his daughter, he lets her be the star. He never pushes himself forward. He is a great singer and an even better man.
You did such a fantastic job. I can't think of anyone who deserves this more. Good Luck! My whole family is Team Dave!
He has talent and everything but let’s be honest...he only made it onto the Voice cuz he’s already famous (or at least well known)
Not really that good, he's trying to sound to much like Ben...
I know it way too soon to say but I feel like he will be the winner of the voice
I melted at the point at his little girl
this is one of my fave songs <3
Brendan Fletcher is my all time favorite contestant on the voice,  and this guy reminds me of him
He was the one on Ellen!!
I love this song....
Yep well this song is going into my next Overwatch edit
I didn't even know he was competing until I saw this! I know who I'm rooting for!
I guess he didn’t see this coming...
OMG THATS THE FATHER OF THE ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL WHO DOES COVERS ON YOUTUBE??!!
My favorite part of this besides the insanely cute family, is adam's face once blake hits his button lol. Its classic.
Not that great but it's some teaching about control, he can get way better.
Can from another country vote for this show.? If it can, i want and will vote for dave.
Wjat was the song in the background when dave picked adam?!!!!
The kind of raspy but smooth and soft tone is just perfect.
I didn't realize that I still had heart. Thank you little girl.
Never heard of him and don't care
Ohhhh him is dad of claire :3..awwwwwweee
This show is retarded
At first I was like sweet Death Cab for Cutie, then boom it was that guy from that adorable dad and daughter video. Good luck Dave
Well done Dave. I have been following you and your little girl from day 1 here in Australia. A father/daughters relationship is something no one can take away but it's great to see you going for a shot. I'm/we are all behind you over here in Oz. Good luck.
The Voice is pretty good this season, lots of great talent!
Iike, no credit to the people who wrote this???
Haha 1st off, I love how Adam was like Fucking blake...\n2nd: I love this family.
These judges turn way too fast
I'm from Olympia Washington
My vote is for Claire
If he was singing about his daughter he should have sang You Were Born by Cloud Cult, still great though.
Hard to judge voice because it's a gentle honest delivery [I'm betting that honesty is what turned Adam around so fast]. It'll be interesting to hear if and when he kicks it up.
this literally brought tears to my eyes because I have been following your family from the very beginning and am one of you subscribers! Hope your new little girl is an amazing singer like your whole family <3
I want to marry him.
Repent from sin, Jesus is Lord
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

Youtuber on a TV show
OMG!!! I love this father-daughter team! Now I have a reason to watch The Voice! Good luck Dave! Hugs & kisses to Claire, your princess!!!
Does anyone know what kind of guitar he has ?
Aww Dave, I had a little tear at this, I'm so excited for you and your wonderful family xx
Good voice... Good luke Dave...
That was totally unplanned. Totally.
A standing ovation for Claire!!!! Sorry Dave! LOL!
DILF 💙
Still trending
Sing baby!  😆
God i cried
Awwww so cute
Love this family!
His thing....

Ugh that little girl singing made me cryyyyyyy.
YAS
He’s so.... breath-y
sad he got kicked out so soon :(
Is there a rule that says there should always be a fucking nigger in the judges?
Hey ...\nWhere's the coaches Song ?!!!\nI want see Jennifer with Miley Cyrus singing together 😀💟
My faith in humanity is restored, once again.
No where near as good as the original. But the video was worth it for the little girl singing.
it's okay not great though
Am I the only one who was not impressed
Is he blind like can't see or...\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I just stupid?
Brilliant song choice!!!
Miley wants to rape her
0:35 That girl terrifies me.
I'm so excited for you!! I never watch the voice but I'm watching it this season to root for you Dave!
I hope he wins!! My favorite singer so far.
1.33 adams face :(
his voice is ....a sleeper..  that said, his kid helps his case...
His voice isn't that unique or great really, I was expecting something better from a video with 2 million views...

Your hair is BEAUTIFUL!!! 💗💗
I did not know about the whole conditioner thing and clogging your pores. Holy I hope this helps out with my back and chest acne. Also new subscriber here, girl you sucked me in xo
Okay but is that really the official theme song bc I need that in every video
Girrrrll I would be too scared to bleach my hair
I just want to know where that necklace is from and your hair is popping. I love natural hair.
The real white privilege is not having black hair. I tried doing my sisters hair and if I had to do what she does every day I would literally die. I now understand her struggles when someone would tell her just put it in a ponytail.
Your hair has grown a lot....you've got length gurl....and I prefer no nails...I like to see your hands work....great routine...Cedric makes breakfast I presume...LOL
Wassup Jackie! I love you girl and I use the same shampoo on my locks and I love it! It cleans really well and gently too. Loved the video! Try Pantene naturals conditioner or Pantene color. Not typically a lack girl brand where I'm from but it works really great on my hair and we have a very similar texture
A hair video from Jackie has been thr highlight of my day😭❤️
I needed every bit of this video!
Question.. would you ever do a natural hair military styling? Cause I'm very curious on that !
I’m slick jealous of your gorgeous curl pattern.
I want to see this glamorous wig collection. Lol I'm ready to meet the girls. Thanks for the tips!! Love them.
Hey Jackie, do you think this could work for Indian hair that is really curly and frizzy 🙄❤️?
Your hair is pretty. I don't blame you for doing wash n go's if that's how (you) want to wear it. The words Jackie and boring don't belong in the same sentence.
I love how defined your curls are! My 4c hair will never be defined like this lol  😩
Did you say one of the gross sisters? I haven't heard that in forever!
Watching you pull at your hair when you were washing it was so satisfying.
finally. dam Jackie. you kept us hanging for decades
I absolutely had NO IDEA THIS IS YOUR NATURAL HAIR.,,,   I love your natural hair, I love the wigs too, but I’m a natural hair girl.   You have the cutest corkscrew curls.   So, just KEEP THE ‘PARTY GOIN.’     Thank you for the info on the bleaching of your hair.   When I was working as a stylist, I remember this absolutely irate mom who practically drug her 2 kids into the salon.   The daughter had thought she could bleach her hair and her younger brothers hair also.  Sadly it cost the mom about $300.00to fix the mess her daughter had made.   I’ve also tried to inform the public that bleaching hair is not as easy as it may look.   \nVelinaTheFlutterby@gmail.com
The Golden Temple facial glaze was limited edition! They said they're bringing it back next year!
Wait, do you not wash out the conditioner? I'm sorry, but I'm a bit confused.
Jackie Imma need you to show your natural hair more often. Stop hiding those beautiful tresses! 😍
Jackieeeeeee can I have your hair?? I would never wear wigs if I had your hair. I love it!! It's sooooo pretty!! Beautiful!! 😻😻😻
Sis your curls are like the perfect shape and they all look the same, you is #blessed
Us girls with curly hair definitely need to moisturize thats true. Our hair is dryyyy.\nDon’t listen to these people and straighten it! Its beautiful!! I love woman that embrace their curls! I feel like wenever i c ur natural hair thats all i wanna c in ur videos.  But it doesnt matter what we want u to do with ur hair. Its YOUR hair not OUR hair.
Shrinkage is sooooo real!! Them curls are poppin tho, I love it I have a similar hair texture to yours but I can never get my curls define so I just put them in two big flag twists all day everyday, that's my go-to style.
WHAAAAAAT ALL THAT *BEAUTIFUL CURLY LENGTH* YOU HAVE!! 😍  This video was Bombt !
This was really cool to watch even though I'm a 2b at most lol
Real talk... I love the Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie^ theme song. I always dance when you sing it hahah 😂😂❤️
Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize and please drink your water.... Ah is Jackie as of Gettin' Grown Podcast!? Cause yo black will crack if it's dry. lol  I def. get what you mean about having to conform within the natural hair community. It's weird that a community that was created for us to free ourselves from mainstream standard created standards within itself. Your curls are poppin though, they're healthy and you love them so that's all that matters. Shout to that Fenty Beauty on the shelf back there!
You skin is gorgeous and you look so stunning with no makeup on.
I have pin straight hair but I’m here for auntie Jackie and I I love curly hair and learning about it 😍💓
I love your hair 😍
THANKS for sharing your curly hair routine Jackie!!! Love you!! Im a natural girl.
I know it's not the same but people always want me to grow my hair out. I look like a stringy mess with long hair. However, this pixie haircut is my life and makes me feel beautiful. I wish people would keep opinions outta my hair and uterus (I'm looking at your Trump).
I've been subscribed for a while but my mind is blown. I swore that was a wig...
I love your natural hair!
The definition in that curl pattern is beautiful...!
girl you hilarious and yo man is fine. SUBSCRIBED! <3
I don't have her hair type, no where near, I'm half Dutch and Asian lol, but I just am so intrigued by all of the care that goes into black women's hair. It's absolutely amazing!
Wash day... Bitter-sweet haha. Takes for ever but the results are so worth it.
Ayyyeee I love the official theme song 🤣💓💓
I just knew I was about to go buy that gold mask 😔
Why at 5:00 she sound like issa rae😂❤️
I love your theme song 😂😊 yesssssss
I'm new and I felt so welcome 😂❤️
Damn. My curls AINT NEVER pop like that lol. How long you been natural?
Jackie your hair is soo beautiful💖
girl i feel you on the most personal level!!!! i have curly hair and i get people always saying to colour and straighten it
Thank you for this! I've asked a very famous YouTubeer to share her routine between installments and she's yet to respond (even a comment).but she shares EVERYTHING else. What's the deal?
Im new but you have good energy so I unsubscribed
Thank you for sharing your hair routine♡.
Your hair is goals
we leave each other little love notes 😭😭😭wow CEDRIC has really upped my standards for guys 😂😂
Aunty Jackieeeeeeee, can we plz get a video in which you talk about natural hair disasters? OMG mannnn I have LOADS 😂💀 (the struggles of being a white girl with curls ranging from 2c-3b and having a mum with dead straight hair 💀... Gurl... My mama had me washing my hair EVERYDAY! I bet you can just imagine the condition of my hair 😂)
One of the gro sisters hahaha did I really just hear that?! I love you!
you are Soo funny and fun! I love your videos. I love your natural hair❤❤
Your curl pattern is life! I'm mesmerized! 😍
You have pretty hair, girl!
Use a bar body soap if you get acne on your body, liquid clogs your pores
Yes! Team let the natural do what it do for the win! I don't tend to give any advice on how to be natural, but when I'm pressed to do it my advice is exactly that. Learn what your hair does and let it be that. Protective styles can give you pretty much any other look you want.
Where did you get your white shelf from? I love it!
Yessss I love this video! For one, I've been contemplating about trying the kinky curly products, definitely on my things to get list. & two, I've always admired how true to yourself you are Jackie! You don't see and hear genuine like you used to on YT, but I can count on you to keep it 100. \n\nXO
I am living for your hair, eyelashes, necklace, and outfit!!! Ugghh so cute and live the simplicity/ at the same time very put together and cute😍😍😍😍
The way you say your name at the beginning makes me want to stab myself
Watching this with my mom and she's amazed at how tight your curls are. She says she's never seen anyone with tight curls like that [natural hair is not common where we live at all; lots of peer pressure to have relaxed or braided styles, and wigs] -- I said, Mom, you know who Solange Knowles is, you saw her on SNL and she said, Who? :-/ \nI'm always jealous of any curls, since I have 1a hair -- probably why my husband has 3b-3c curls, lbvs. I've a cousin with 3c hair and when we were kids we always used to joke that we wanted to trade hair, lol. I tried to get a 3b perm two different times when I was little, and my hair is so straight it only turned out to be 2b until I washed it the first time, then it was 2a for a few months, lol. I mean, it's so straight that when I donate my hair and get it shaved off [which I do every five years], it takes four months until my bangs don't stick straight out from my head, sorta 'There's Something About Mary'-ish. -_- Trying to give myself curls with heat styling doesn't work at all -- especially if I try to use product, because that just weighs my hair down more -- I have to do rag curls overnight [starting from wet, almost-squeaky-clean hair] just to get 2c curls *for four hours*. //sigh//
guuuurl you are GLOWING

Hey Jackie, \nI know that you said you do your wash n go daily and you wish you could do hairstyles that lasted for longer than a day. Have you tried sleeping with in your wash n go or a gel with a bit of a stronger hold? Wondercurl has been pretty good for me. Been following you since when you were blogging and I'm so happy for your success!
Yeeeaaahhh.... I don’t want a clock right next to my bed with a camera on it. Don’t need to explain why
Nobody reading this has finished the video
I want this as a center console in a Mini Cooper
Next comes Echo G-Spot.
This will make turning off the alarm too easy.\n Alexa, SHUTUP
So, pay Amazon to watch you have sex?
$150?  I'll pass .
Amazon wants camera and mic in every room of the house
Couldn't even do a blooper correctly.
Great job CIA 😀👌🙌🎆🎉🔥
I still don't understand the need for these things. I guess if you have some smart stuff in their house or if you really need to video call someone but for me already have an alarm clock. Already have a weather forecaster. Its called the phone or TV.
Big brother will be wat hing
Big brother is watching.
Sorry but I'll just never be comfortable inviting sensor packed data harvesting AI training devices into my home unless they're open source
Great. So now amazon can listen to whatever happens in your bedroom and recommend sextoys to you if there is not so much going on under the sheets anymore. Who could wish for more?
How come Amazon sucks at making products.
Why would anyone want that wire tap in their house?
Okay, of all of the echo products so far, this one (to me at least) looks the most futuristic of the bunch. I don't even use Alexa or any smart home appliances for that matter, but I want it anyway
one in the kitchen, bedroom, and living room? yeah no thanks. and you know why...
Looks cool but always listening is becoming always watching...
Looks nice but Alexa can’t answer some very basic questions. Would love to see this hardware with google assistant intelligence.
0:48 indeed, a good clcol amazon echo spot is
Just as a word of advice to some of the people commenting, here's a hint: ANYTHING with a camera or a microphone connected to the internet can be used by the government to watch you. Your phone, any microphones you have connected to your computer, webcams, all of that can be used to watch you. So, can the government watch you through this? Yes. Of course they can, and I'm sure they probably will. But they can also watch you at all times when you're on your phone or your laptop watching this video. It isn't new information, people. Yes, these devices can be used to watch you, but anything connected to the internet with some kind of recording device can be used to do that. The only difference is that this is a smart alarm clock. Doesn't matter.
The dot next to my computer keeps waking up to this
So pretty much a device that does everything my smartphone already does.  I think I'll pass.
Probably most appealing thing in the line-up more affordable price, small modern form-factor, and it has the luxury of a screen + all the features of a regular echo.
But does it have an aux out port. If it does I'd totally get one.
FREE video calls?!? No freaking way!
don't put that in bedroom
Imagine Alexa in your bedroom listening to you sleep...
This is my favorite eco but I’m not buying it since amazon have information to the government about people talking to the eco
Not sure about having a camera next to my head while I'm sleeping.  Believe it or not, I obviously LOVE tech....emmm emm my tech review channel :).  However, when it's time to sleep I want absolutely NO TECH in my bedroom, including my phone.
Does youtube work on it?
WALLS HAVE EARS! AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!
I wonder why they didn't make the screen bigger. Should have went with a 3 screen
Wow now that's cool
new product from CI... i mean amazon 😊
I think this is the most interesting of the new devices but it's real potential is lost to me when it doesn't keep a charge for like lets say the power goes out...    Then it's not a dependable alarm clock.
Who wonna trade vid clips on this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any idea if the display can turn off?  Asking for the clock in a bedroom use case.
Has anyone ever told Alexa to shut up
Coming Soon: Amazon Cool Beans- an alexa enabled refrigerator, specifically designed for beans. starts at 1299
Why would you want a camera on it?
My Echo kept going off during this video lmao
Doesn't this one look too similar with the upcoming smart speaker by the essential?
too pricey, $75 per an we got a deal
It's a buy and a great deal.. can't wait for the knock off version
This looks cool but has personal data breach written all over it. -no thanks.
So it does nothing my phone can't do.
Put one in your bedroom huh? then don't forget to cover the camera or turn it around whenever you're pleasuring yourself, cause you just never know who's watching.........
South Park should had waited to make that Alexa episode how funny whould this be if they mocked the fact that this thing has a camera on it
Ah, great...  A camera next to my bed
When I first saw it in the thumbnail I thought, dang nest made a virtual assistant... NICE... oh dang it’s amazon.
The amount of times this video triggered Alexa...
Great, they can now watch me sleep...
i always hate how whenever i watch a video about alexa it keeps triggering my echo dot
We are in future OMG
Looks really nice! Looks like Amazon is doing well with their tech
Great now the NSA can see me sleeping !!
hi i'm Casey, and this is 90 seconds on the verge
Wait until edward snowden see this..
A smart alarm clock? Nice.
Make Alexa Great Again #MAGA
STOP saying ALEXA! lol

I'd pay $20 for this glorified photoframe.
this is pretty cheap so idk why people are complaining
The end was cringeworthy.
I'm with Google..
Need more hot girls\nlmao
Is there anyway that if you had one in your kitchen, in your living room, on your desk, and in your bedroom that you can link them and use them as home surveillance?
Hey it ships out on my birthday 😀
130 is way too expensive
Got Siri, I don’t need this weird spyware thing too.
The issue with this is that an alarm clock needs 100% reliability. What if there is no power or WiFi. Does it have back up power and does the clock work fully with no internet. Does it go down sometimes.  On a regular Echo none of this matters, but it does on an alarm clock. That has to work every single time, with no exceptions ever.
Forth
No Ethernet, who wants to sleep with WiFi next to their head, that's dangerous.

Try https://www.audible.com/numberphile and check out The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry\n\nEnvy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655 --- A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the *maximum* number of cuts in the n person case.
So everyone gets a mess on their plate. You don't need maths for that.
Someone should buy Alex a protractor...
wrap a cord around the cake, cut it to size so it wraps end to end, fold one end over so that the point rests half way between the other end and the fold itself.\nmark the fold, and the overlapping end.\nwrap the cord around the cake, and cut from the center to the marks.\nperfect thirds.
cut the cake into quarters, cut the fourth corner into thirds (easy because its a triangle)
Oooor you have a 4th person doing the cutting and assigning without bias.
Why not just cut each piece in 120 degree?
Find the average molar mass of the cake, calculate the amount of particles, and have each person take turns picking individual particles until you're out. Of course, use a better pattern than just 1, 2, 3... to take turns, since that wouldn't be fair
Dr. Fry reading something as mundane as the dictionary aloud could sooth my mind and body to a coma-like slumber.
This teach us, if you are the first person to cut the cake. Don't do silly things
Mathematicians with nothing better to do. I'll  cut it myself and I choose the first piece. End of story.
Just cut it into 6. Thats easy to do evenly. Then everyone gets 2 slices
What if Alice cuts 3 perfect prices then bob cuts one of them in half? Someone will get half a piece. This concept seems really flimsy in practice.
just get each person to vote unanimously on the location of each slice. or score a scoring.
How about just using a scale and weighing out the pieces evenly?
damn it, an audio book narrated by hannah fry? that's immensely arousing...
I'm getting the results back from my math test. Wish me luck!
Why not just cut it into exact thirds? Lol
This reminds me a little of Nash's Equilibrium Points in n-Person Games
why can't you just use a protractor, determine the center, and cut at 120 degree intervals?
That scenario playing out the way that was detailed relies on the person cutting the cake first not making a right mess of it and/or not being able to see they've made a mess of it. If you realised that you'd cut two big pieces and one smaller piece, you'd be a bit miffed if you got that smaller piece and a sliver of that final piece that is cut into three, which would not make up for your main slice.
About 25 years ago, at lunch with colleagues, we used the following approach for cheese:\n- Always cut 1 more piece than the number of people (n people = n+1 pieces), in as similar sizes you can.\n- Each person picks the piece they prefer.\n- The remaining piece is then cut by another person in n+1 pieces.\n- Each person picks the piece they prefer, shifting the previous order by 1 person\nThis procedure repeats until nobody cares for the remaining particles of cheese.\nQuite honestly, our method seems easier than the method described in your video above and is equally fair.
Its 3am and im here why tho?
Or, you could carry a protractor and ruler wherever you go, like a normal person.
Mark out 0°, 120°, and 240° on the table. This can be done with a pencil and a sheet of paper. 90° from the paper itself and another 30° by trisecting an angle with origami (another great Numberphile video). \n\nThere's no arguing against 120° of cake.
You could of titled the video Envy Free Cake for Three, come on!
Or, you know, you make every piece exactly the same size. 7 coins (or other circles), 1 in the center and 6 around. 2 coins per piece and you have 3 pieces of exactly the same size. A whole lot easier.
You could also \n1) divide by weight or\n2) use a protractor to measure 120 degrees for each slice about the centre
This is why I stab people
How about this: cos(60 degrees) = 0.5. Therefore, draw a diameter line on the cake. Divide the diameter in half, label the halfway point as the origin. Then, draw a point halfway between the origin and the edge. Draw a line perpendicular from that point to the upper and lower edge of the cake to make two new points, A and B. Then mark a 3rd point C, on the intersection of the cake edge and the diameter line furthest from A and B. Points A, B, and C are, for any pair, 120 degrees apart. Cake shared.
How does this compare with the N person method presented by Marilyn vos Savant (and possibly others, but that's the source I know) in which one person cuts an initial incision into the cake and then sweeps the knife along until anyone, including the person with the knife, sees a size they are happy with can call it out and ask for the cut to happen?\n\nSince no one is prohibited from speaking, when a size that is reached for a given person is reached, they can claim it. It is asserted that the division will be fair because everyone save the last person picked the size of their own slice entirely. The last person will then be left with either a 1/N amount of cake (approximately) or greater as they wanted more than anyone else and thus got the most they could while being fair to the others involved.\n\nA variation of this stops when 2 (of the N) people remain and divides the remainder using the common 2 person solution of having one make the final cut and the other chose which slice they want.
But this is all a psychological thing? I don't understand why this has much to do with mathematics. It's not equal or fair, just satisfactory for all involved. If you wanted that you can just have everyone eat their random slice of cake inside a box so the others can't see it. Make sure to cut out a random bit so they can't calculate by the diameter of circular cakes.
and thats why you dont share kids 1(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)=1
How about this: Alex, Barbara, and Charlie are trying to share a cake. Each person makes one diameter cut across the cake, starting with Alice, then Barbara, then Charlie. Then each person takes one piece of cake, Alice Barbara, Charlie then Charlie Barbara Alice. It should even out in the end unless someone decides to slice the cake sideways or something.
Or, assuming the cake is a circle, you could just cut it into 120 degree sized chunks.
we've solved it folks. there will now be no more war! yeah! we did it!
just make marks on the top of the cake so it's in 6 pieces and then cut 2/6 or 1/3 for everybody...
Quick guess, cut it in 6 and pick two slices.\n\n\nSeems I was wrong but my way has a lot less faffing about. And that cake looks poxy.
forced to trim off his piece, and then gets screwed on picking the trim? if I was bob I'd be PISSED
Or just cut it into approximate thirds?
Cut it into 6 pieces and let everyone pick 2.
Upon seeing the title, I was thinking it was going to be about dividing a cake into three equal parts by cutting all the way through (e.g. by two lines).
Why not just use a protractor and cut it into 3 equal 120 degree slices?
The British are a weird people.\nThe put fruit in cake.\nThe put meat in pie.\nThe put raisins in pudding.
Among. Between is used for something shared by two people. Among is used for something shared by three or more people
When do they kiss?
Nice to see some Numberphile on trending :)
Man, that's a delicious voice... just not going to to say which one. ; )
Cut it in 120 degree angle each and all three will be happy..
Now imagine there are 3 people who don't care about having all equal cake
How I would deal with this. Cut the cake in half then divide on half into two. Give one quarter to friend one, give the second quarter to friend two. Proceed to eat the remaining half.
or use a marked circle
This is unnecessarily complicated. A cake is a circle, just cut your piece so that it's angle is 360/n, where n is the number of people. For the example of 3, each person would have a piece that is 120 degrees.
U went to the same school as me lol
Get their own cake. Don't tell me they don't want a whole cake because they begin not even knowing how much cake they're gonna get
Nice voice and accent - me, an internet weirdo
just cut it into 6th's and everyone gets two slices that compliment each other.(smallest with largest,2nd smallest with 2nd largest).
This is a solution which produces slices which A,B and C all only subjectively THINK are equal but are quite likely (if not absolutely certain) to NOT be equal.
I could listen to Hannah explaining any topic all day.
OR you could get a protractor.
Just cut the cake into six slices... two slices for each person
Why do you niggas have to make cutting a cake complicated, just divide it in 3 equal pieces
I think youve just made the cake into crumbs!
Alice, Bob and Charlie sure are petty possessive assholes.
Hannah is so down-to-earth. It's great.
3 people. Anne, Bob and Cate. Anne cuts first into 3 slices as evenly as she can, but we all know they're not perfect. Bob then cuts each slice in half, as evenly as he can, so we have 6 slices. Cate picks the 1st slice. Back to Anne, who picks the 2nd slice. Bob then picks the 3rd and 4th slice. Anne picks the 5th and Cate gets the 6th. \nAnne and Bob cut as evenly as they could, but Cate picks first, which gives her the best slice - only right, since she's done no cutting. Since Bob was the last to make cuts, Anne gets the 2nd - perhaps not the biggest/best slice, but there are 4 other slices that aren't as desirable. Bob has seen the best two slices go to his friends, but he can now leave the worst two slices for them, and he gets the best two of what's left. Naturally, since Cate got the best slice, she also gets the worst, so Anne leaves that for her. \nEveryone gets two reasonably equal slices of cake, and the mass of them is as even as 3 kids in my mother's kitchen could work out.
cut 6 and you each get 2
Better way is to cut to 8 pieces (splitting in half 3 times) Each person get 2 pieces. Plit the remaining 2 pieces in half. Each person get 1 piece. Split the remaining small piece in 3.
Or cut it 3 equal pieces
more to the point.... if the cake is cut perfectly into thirds, thats 33.3% of the cake, but who gets the 0.1%
yeah I'm not so sure I agree with the logical flow when it comes to why in the end how everyone is sure to be  happy and without envy. This algorithm assumes that Alice does not change her mind about her initial judgement after viewing the decisions made by Bob and Charlie. After that inspection she may think she made a mistake and wish she had made a different decision. \nI do agree, as stated in the video, that the size of the slice is not the only contributing factor to the quality of the slice as judged by a human observer. I would also assert, however, that the sum total quality of all the slices (the quality of the entire cake) is reduced with each slice that is made, because with each slice the appearance, durability, and texture of the cake is reduced due to the introduction of more and more entropy by the cake cutting process. The rate of this increased entropy depends greatly on the materials used to make the cake as well as cake temperature. (no bake cheese cake for example behaves much differently than the cake shown in the video) \nThe point being, as N number of people increases the more cuts need to be made, the more the entire cake loses quality, which means that each piece while perhaps being more fair, on average will be of a lesser quality then using an unfair system. This algorithm is simply trading quality for fairness. If a large amount of people across the globe decide to use such a system, the sum total quality of all cakes in the world would decrease. Thus the efficiency of cakes' ability to make people happy is reduced. Not only that, but if one country decides to use such a system and neighboring countries do not, the net loss in happiness in the country that uses this system will breed envy on an international level. Wars have been started over less. Let them eat cake indeed. \n\nAlso to really be fair, this algorithm needs to be recursive on that little left-over piece until everyone agrees that the last remaining leftover piece is too small to be significant and is thrown over their shoulder to the dogs.
Solution is simple: Don't share
Some people dont care about size, they care about the crusty bits
Wtf? Like halfway in the vid, when it was getting interesting, oh they're doing some math here, que ad. What?
For a moment I thought we were going recursive.
This is why I only have 1 friend.
Oh my god yes, you really DO hear all the bodily noises when you've got a monitoring loop in your ear. It's so unnerving D:
Just cut 6 pieces and each get two that way it’ll also be easier to eat!!
1) Add four scoops ice cream to cake\n2) Liquefy mixture in blender until homogenous\n3) Distribute evenly between three similar glasses by apparent volume\n4) Measure mass of each glass' contents\n5) Use pipette to closer approximate equality by weight\n6) Freeze liquid \n7) Break glass, remove, discard\n8) Cut each frozen cakecream cylinder into nine even portions by thickness\n9) Distribute disks between group, cycling (as would a poker dealer) to mitigate random error through even distribution of slice discrepancy \n10) Disregard the fact that step #8 poses inherently the same problem as does the original\n11) Add cakeshake slices to new glass\n12) Thaw, serve.
This is a perfect example of maths taking the fun out of life. Just get a protractor already, if it bothers that much. Makes one hell of a mess of a cake :)
I keep a protractor I'm my right pocket at all times
I'd just cut the cake into 12 equal pieces, and give each person 4 slices.
Well over a third of this video is an ad
you could score two diameter lines across the cake so that you have a center point, then put a 360 degree protractor in the middle and cut every 120 degree.\n\n\nor you could just cut three freaking pieces and get over the fact that one person might have more than the other...
You just keep on trying until you run out of cake!
I don't need to cut it because I don't have any friends
int [ x^[ x / ln x ]   dx  ]  = x^[ x / ln x ]   + C
Among*? :/
buy 2 cakes, eat one myself
Bogus.
Persons who fuss get stabbed.
This sounds like nonsense.
cut into 6 pieces give everyone 2
Hannah Fry 😍
Is this protocol collusion resistant?
Let them eat cake!
Eh.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like cupcakes better.
Why is this trending?
JUST CUT THE FLIPPING CAKE
All lovely nasal vocals
What about Phoenix Arizona?!?!
I don't comment very much, but you create some of the best videos on YouTube. All your videos are entertaining and well put together.
ok but let's be real. the hottest thing ever is me
Do ISIS vs North Korea
Wait so if the sun got so hot the surface was toasted does that mean mars will be able to have life since it won’t be that cold?
Why am I not here?
The hottest thing on the planet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMe 😎
It's actually me
Man can never be hot
Don’t forget about marble bar, Australia which gets regular weeks of 49-50 degree days IN A ROW and once had 136 days in a row over 38.
Does anyone else realize that Arizona has temperatures over 120F multiple times a year
Where is arizona at though
im still waiting my name to appear in the video...
You are wrong about the UK being divided on celsius and fahrenheit. We put firmly a Celsius country and not one British person would understand Fahrenheit. Not sure how you came to that conclusion
the entire world apart from the US uses Fahrenheit\n\nUses fahrenheit throughout the entire video and puts Celsius in brackets. Xooxo
When you mix fuel, metal oxide, and metal powder in just the right way, it burns at 2000 C*. Hot enough to cut through nearly any barrier known to man. Throw some c4 into the mix and you've got once hell of a combination.
I'm sorry to say but you missed a place that has regular summer temperature of over 104° F this being Phoenix AZ.
Seatbelt in the summer
I live in Bahrain (middle East), and it has gotten to almost 50 degrees Celsius in the summer. It's fucking unbelievable.
QUASAR 3C273 is known to be the hottest thing human has ever known. It's a active galactic nucleus by the way.
I live in lower CA about 6 hours from Death Valley, and it got to 123 degrees F on the hottest day of summer
Yeah I can list something really hot..... Me;)
Hello infographic show r u stupid, australia is so hot, u must not have done enough research with temps passing 55 degrees in summer (dec to feb)
great video and graphics.
Even though I'm American I know Celsius as well as Fairenhight because we always use it in science
ENGLAND IS A BURNING CITY
A thermocouple does not use resistance for measurement. The 2 metals generate a voltage that changes with temperature. Now the accuracy of all your videos are in doubt.
By quoting Andrew Bird you've got a sub for life.
A place in Iran got up to temperatures of 70 degrees celcius people only go there for salt mining \n\nPlus the measurement for temperatures in death valley where not accurate at the time the heat that was present in Iran was recorded through a satellite
I better see Texas In here
Why y'all always measure by surface of the sun what's the temp. Inside it?
basically a less energetic, less scientific, less informative version of vsauce's How Hot can it Get?
Actually blue flame is hotter compared to yellow or red...
The summer of 2013 in Australia was so FUCKING HOT!
I’m pretty hot
Can u plzzz change ur map For india.... The map that u r using is a wrong one... \nTHE STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR IS  WRONGLY BORDERED \nPOK(PAKISTAN OCCUPIED KASHMIR) is an integral part of india
What happened to the military comparison's
The orange yellow part of the flame is NOT the hottest, basic chemistry will prove that...
To all you Europeans getting on Infographics' ass on imperial and metric, burn in 90 degrees.
Am I the only one who loves it that he adds polls for the next video?
The UK does not use Fahrenheit, no weather channel or news programme or forecast of any type in the UK will ever use Fahrenheit. The UK is not divided on this. 0 degrees is freezing, 100 degrees is boiling.... simple for everyone involved.
Bud when the flame turn white and blue is the hottest that's why you see when you see people welding the flame is white
Lil Pumps Music is obviously the hottest thing in the Universe
Celsius makes sense and isn't as arbitrary like Fahrenheit.
I remember it being 120 degrees Fahrenheit outside in AZ around a month ago.
I am the hottest thing ever to exist
What about the hot pocket I just  took out of the microwave? The sun aint got nothing on that.
This prostitute's ass is very tight , hot and I'm loving this heat 🔥🔥🥂
I get pretty hot in December
Hahaha guys remember when last year we were like Its too goddamn hot and now we are all drowning in like five fucking hurricanes hahaha
BTS is the hottest thing to exist
I bet he is Chinese
The hottest thing in the universe is my gf............I mean, my right hand
You should make whats the animal that can survive the hottest temperature\nLike humans then so on and so forth
Love the biggest facts. Good video thx.
Why am I not on the list.....
Arizona regularly gets higher than 105... why wasn’t it on this list?
the first 30 second gave me an existential crisis.
Where is the music from
Fahrenheit is gay\nCelsius is more logical.\nLife if you agree!
Hottest? I'll go with the maker of these videos :)
I was waiting for Kuwait and Iraq to be mentioned. There is a photo documenting 62°C at one day back in 2016.
I'm the hottest thing
Why am i not on this list?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*kill me*
One time I lost a bet and I had my friends put a water bottle mouth that was heated up with a lighter for like 2 minutes get stuck on the inside part of my shin. It was so hot the plastic bent and was melted onto my skin and I had to use all my strength to rip it off
My heart\n\n\n\n\n\nWait this isnt the coldest thing on earth video
Nah, girls in my school are hotter

Can we please talk about the trumpet players dance moves and him just jamming out to the max in the back 😂👌
No wonder why she went solo... This girl is a unique popstar, singer and performer. So much charisma... It's so natural that it seems effortless.
2 days later ... STILL OBSESSED. Who else is with me ?!
Her voice is so stable. It's so amazing. 🌹
The music,the trumpet sound,her voice are sexy
Really catchy. I love this song.
she doesnt need guys as backup dancers and them go touching fifth harmony ladies. U SLAY GIRL!
Camila is such a good performer 😍❤ Every performance ir her is very original and different
She can really sing wow.. very talented good for her
I can´t describe her perfection, this is so nice to see, the colors, the dancing, her voice, the perfect sound omg.
Better than the studio version! Queen slayyyyssss
I loved it from the first, now I love it more
WOW did not expect that!!!!❤️❤️
Golden performance. Speechless. Wishing her the best in life. Stay humble as always.
Please make these dancers permanent Camila!!!  This is my fav of her songs so far & she looks so beautiful 😻
Wow
She's stunning
Her vocals sounds smoother 😍💯
TRENDING WORLD WIDE WITHOUT SHADING ANYONE ! AMAZING ! <3
I appreciate her live being as good as the recorded song
this simple concept  yet but spectacular ❣️❣️❣️ #Camila😘
BITCH MY WIG'S BEEN SNATCHED ONCE AGAIN!
Camila is the most view in this channel ! Whit 2 M rep
who the guy on the trumpet?
the trumpet guy is me striving for constant attention
2:17 So that's just the role of tge mic standing at Camila's back? 😂
At first I wad like,  Hit? That's a stretch! \nBut, by the end I was like, Havana, ooh na na!
She did great but sounds tired.
Im anitter , Brasil love U Camilla ❤
😍😍🙈🙈😍😍
Selenators supporting Camilla <3
omg the dance, gives me boners
She doesn’t need autotune🐸
iTunes version?
I would
He looks like zac Efron (trumpet man) 😳
It's become like a daily ritual for me to watch this video and camila
Who came here coz they love Camila😭😭❤️🙌
im the guy at the back
I liked her Life acoustic guitar performance on the Elvis Duran radio Show this morning.  Thanx for that!
The lyrics were wrong, it should be my entire wig is on havana-ooh-na-na
She writes her song, she can change notes effortlessly, she plays guitar and piano with eyes close, sing beautifully, dances very well, talk so intelligently. She's the complete package. The ideal popstar of this generation. Someone everyone can look up to.
I love how sexy this performance was, without showing a lot of skin or make their ass bounce. Bring modesty back!!
My wife😍😍😍 i love it!!!
ARGHHhhhh melts. LOVE IT!!!! And that trumpet guy is good. urgh this is good
Why do people with shit comments get so many likes? Meh. Lets give it a try:\n\nShe is so good
this should be a music video
amazing control of her voice ! sounds like a studio version  but its LIVE !!! In love with the song ! FH should learn from her lol
İ love this song ,make me chill but cool for you camila
Not a fan of 5th harmony,  but i love her... \nShe really based on talent,  not by revealing skin \nOh na na na 😍
I wanna smoke in front of the beach with this song lol
I am *s h o o k e h*
So proud of her ! 💙\nAny Latinos, Latinas here ?
I NEED A STUDIO VERSION OF THIS
my eyes were on the trumpet guy. the entire time. 😂
Excellent, you're my best
No auto tune needed 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘
Amazinggggg.... Who love too?
Perfection.
Camila, please please please MARRY ME! ♥
Amazing👌🏼
Ooooooookayyy biiiiiitch ! 💖👏👏

Love my girl Camila!!! Es la mejor!!
esta mujer no necesita auto-tune \nsu voz ya es hermosa \nuna razón más para entrar a su  fandom \:v/
wonderful
She's a force of her own.
PERFECT 👏👏👏❤🙏
She's just amazing 😍
Best live performance😘😘
I try so hard to.stop watching her videos.and stuff.i just cant..wtf..i realy need help  lol..
I don't like Camila, but she did good!
Did she sample Same old Love from Selena? Just really sounds like it. Still a really good song tho! 😍❤
Is no one gonna mention the trumpet guy in the background dancing by himself for most of the performance 😂
I thought the beginning was im so sick of that same old love- Selena Gomez
I didn't like her after she left Fifth Harmony but how can I not like her after this performance
The New Selena
no rap version>>>>>>
Me enamora 😘
Arrasoooouuu
QUE HINO DE APRESENTAÇÃO
This is the definition of SEXY. Pure SEXY. not all female singer could do this lol
love this song..always love latino songs
Esse povo falando mal das fifth eu fico pasma! Sou Camilizer e Harmonizer e ainda fico surpresa com isso, Camila tinha ( ou tem, não sabemos. ) uma amizade com TODAS ELAS maravilhosa, e todos os fãs de verdade souberam respeitar a saída da Cabello, porém continua sempre desmerecendo 5H ou Camz, vocês tem que entender que elas todas estão em uma nova era, queira vocês ou não.
Dammit. As much as I don't like her, she slayed this damn performance. She seems like a much better and more natural performer by herself.
Havana oh na na? Or havana una na?
Hence proved: you don't need to take your clothes off to be sexy.\nSlay my queen 😍😍😍😍
Por qué hacen playback !!! Que madres .. no lo necesita que cante en vivo 🤔🤔🤔
You're adorable. Made my stressful day much better.
i hope you aware that all these employees are out of job now because of your stupid video
Amazing! Thanks for dancing and sharing yourself with us. With those dance moves and your great attitude, You should be on Ellen :)))
Priceless!  I've thoroughly enjoyed watching this video several times . . . and, no doubt, will watch it again (e.g., *right now*!).  Thank you, Mahshid!
Oml what the aliens must be thinking of us 🤔😂
You're a great dancer, and it's amazing that you found so many people who can also dance very well! Thanks for spreading some joy during these stressful times.
Incredible! Love your positivity in such a negative situation!
You have the best attitude and outlook on the situation you've been handed. Are you single? I'd love to have a gf who has your personality, enthusiasm and sense of humor!
Mahshid, this is awesome. I work for Tribune Media - can we get permission to share and air this?
I needed this. Thank you
The world needs more of you....NOW!!
Im sure you bought the rights to use the song before posting this video... right? right????????
Why isn't this longer?
How about cleaning up the shitty airport instead of making a stupid video?
You made me SMILE. Love it.
You dear woman are the type of person I would like to travel with . Make the BEST of any situation  !!!!

For you girls who don't understand the word thick.\n\nThat in no way is an insult, she's amazingly beautiful and she's got the weight in all the right places. Being a thick healthy girl is beautiful.\n\nPlus the fact she can move is just all the more sexy.
This made my day.  I love everyone in the video, but the woman in the yellow-green vest has especially got the moves!  Dancedancedance
those hips are to die for.  What a cutie.
GDDAMN you've mastered that moonwalk!  Very, very well done, Mahshid.  Thanks for bringing light into the world.

Thanks for putting a smile on my face! you go girl!
Its cool! Hi from Belarus!
Mahshid-- thanks for showing the world that dance makes everything better! Since you love dance, you should try my favorite exercise program, Jazzercise! It's all about dancing and it's the most fun you'll have while working out!!

I want to fuck your pussy so bad 😂 jks
who recorded you ? Did you have a videographer with you lol
And to think you made $1000 on this video already.........   lol    \nGreat job.  :)
We experienced every single emotion that night.
Drogba can draw and score goals, what can't he do?😂
Miss that squad bad. Specially Cech Drogba and Lampard.
He deserves everything that's good on earth.
Why has he not got a statue outside the bridge
Damn the highlights still give me goose bumps. Even rewatching the semis, how we were one man down, how ramires chipped Valdez, how torres scored, how depsite all odds against us the seemingly blackhorse chelsea made it to munich and damn, this game sure was one to remember. Thankyou chelsea fc, Thankyou King Drogba.
Drogbaaaaaaa.....Its a goal of destiny.
and i'm still get goosebumps, Everytime i watch video about final UCL 2012...
Who's cutting onions over here?\nThe best day of my life. 💙
I will forever be grateful for what I've felt in that day. Till today I still feel the affects of it and I'm thankful to that entire squad of Chelsea legends. And king Drogba thank you, much love, respect and profound gratitude for being who you're. Not only a great footballer but even a better human being, a fighter and loyal to the end.
We love you big pete <3
didier drogba aka god what a moment i was 14 years old watching it with my dad and when drogba scored the penalty my father started crying ill never forget that moment in my whole life
Wow! This just shows how intelligent Frank Lampard is when Drogba spoke about the equalizer,  he says how he was scared when Frank was in front of him and it was a perfect ball for him, most footballers would have probably gone for the ball/glory yet Frank knew the big Dog had the greatness to score that magnificent header and left it. No wonder these two were so telepathic :)
stay up all night to see the result \ni couldnt stop crying when chelsea beat munich \nnot only this game before we reach the final every moment was magical to me we were losing and we mange to win at the end \nfootball is fuckin unbelievable
Didier, I will love you till I die, my absolute favorite footballer of all time.
Amazing...its great to remember that moment
How can you remember so vividly?
Still brings a tear to my eye
Draw the 2008 final next 😊
That was a moment when I was starting to cry. A tears of happiness after The Blues finally claim their 1st UCL Trophy. #GoBluesArmy
I was the only one getting goosebumps?
Didier that goal of yours in champions league means a lot to me not only as a Chelsea fan but as a man who truly realized that everything is indeed possible with hard work, dedication and faith!!!
Love this LEGEND! nohomo
Why
Tears tears tears 😢
I shared tears... Emotional stuff
CHELSEA WIN !!!!!!!!!😊😱💪💪💪💪
One thing we also tend to forget is that if we drogba doesn't concede the penalty, ribery doesn't come off injured, and olic probably doesn't take the 4th penalty
hey drogba ur my  best striker ,as a striker  y u werent wear no 9 jersie
Legend!!! Really miss him at Chelsea
We need a statue of King Drogba oustside the Bridge
Drogba! the good old days....\nCome on Chelsea! salute you from México.
A night all us Chelsea fans will not forget !
That was so beautiful... Amaazing!!! Amazing!!!
The moment still makes my eyes moist!
Absolutely respect drogbas words for Cech both heros on the night legends always.
Every time i saw this , i cried out , because of this moment i came to know that football is a not just a game 22 players playing for one destiny , actually they are repersenting trillions of fan like me ! Every player who played for chelsea or playing for chelsea is the legend Always !!thank you DD, And big man PC
The first time I ever cried with happiness over a football match...
Ohh i'm so miss this moment...
I never not get chills and goosebumps when I watch this 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Even his opponents can't hate him.
The night i never slept 💙💙💙💙 best moment ever Chelsea till i die
Thank You for the first UCL Trophy, KING DROGBA 😎😎😎
no matter what team you support drogba will always be a legend
I would to speak with Didier drogba
one of the best night in my life. thank you for that night
Best header ever. That look on Drogba's face after the penalty as he runs in victory. I get teary eyed every time. Thank you Didier. Legend. KTBFFH
That equaliser... A man for the biggest of games. Superlative record in finals (apart from that Vidic slap in 2008).
Great Video for us Blues!   Come on Chelsea!
He deserved a ballon d'or 🎈🎈🎈
Love you for the memories Drogba! 😘😍 Just feels like yesterday! Chelsea legend forever in our hearts! 👏🙏
Oh Man\n...Just...  Beautiful ..remember that day..  what a moment that day.. CHAMPION.. !
Drogba, you will be forever The King of Stanford Bridge, what a moment that night, unforgettable!!!!
I miss drogba so much what a legend
DROOOOOOOOOOGBBAAAAAAAAAAAA i miss ya mate, there will no one like you ever again to wear the Chelsea blue with pride \nAs watching you made me a fan of Chelsea Footbal CLub.
I actually cried while remembering this
Drogba is a G he is one of the best Chelsea players to ever live
I have to admit, I still get a bit teary eyed thinking about that.
Big Pete won it for Chelsea that day.
I remember that didier penalty, when it went it I just went mental and I screamed WE WON!!!!!!!! Ps his drawing is ten times better than mine
I was not looking at Robbens Penalty i hear my Dad screaming YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES and it was at that moment that i knew we were gonna be Europes Champions!!! #ComeOnYouBlues
THANKS DROGBA, THANKS CECH , THANKS ALL THE BLUES  BEST MEMORY OF MY LIFE
If Samsung is still sponsor, I think the drawing tools would be changed to Note 8.
This is the best drawn I've ever seen! So much respect for Petr Cech, you're trully a Blue Legend, Drogba!
how come he forgot the moment he saw a spider on kalou's head
Chelsea to di world,Drogba is genius
NO WONDER WE HAVE LEGENDS LIKE YOU PETER, FRANK. LOL WHEN I THINK OF MAN SHITTYS LEGENDS  :)
Surely Drogba has to get an icon card, together with Lampard and terry

Thank you to everyone who made a purchase on eBay via our affiliate link at http://rossmanngroup.com/ebay for helping support this type of content. Your viewership is appreciated and as always, I hope you learned something!
My notifications said New Torkers and I was so confused. The contractor should consider a job in programming.They solved the problem in the least complicated way possible.
Louis you're my fucking hero! I spilled a full glas of red vine over my 1 week old macbook pro (late 2013 bought it 2nd hand). i was frustrating and hated myself. you gave me confidence so i decided to open it up and repair it on my own. it was completly dead (even no light on the charger). i renew all damaged connections... some pins even vaporized when i heated them up because of the acid from the vine. i was lucky that i didn't need to buy any new components. i want to thank you for motivating people to do those repairs on their own, and you do well in showing that your skills are not special, actually everyone can do it with some practice. the microscope aswell the ultra sonic cleaner on my working place helped a lot of course... keep moving on - your repair videos are just fucking hilarious, i had to laugh a lot while i was realising i potentially lost 1000$. lots greetings from germany :)))) this message has been written on a water damaged macbook pro
The real problem here is ur poor choice of a contractor....
Correction, that is not duct tape. It is a high tech polymer film used by NASA to control the international space station's water leaks. So it should be good enough for New Yorkers 👽
Congratulations on trending on YouTube!
All of New York is a funnel going down the drain.
I'm from PA and see this in the warehouse I work in... lol
*watches one DIY video on YouTube*\n\nI think I could start my own business now!
If it is stupid and it works, it ain't stupid.
yikes how much did they try to ask for that
Think of this as trumps health care if it passes
Look fixed pay the contractor
Take that shit to Judy, judge Judy.
Hope you didn't pay for this.
When your contractor is eating small squares of blotter paper with little cartoon characters printed on them, don't let him repair your AC unit...
Hey, I work for UK news site The Mirror. Please could we use some of this video in our on-site player? We will of course credit you.
how to even I can't lo
Hmm!? That's a Macgyverism not  a good work.
As a contractor from washington, this makes me sad...
That was pretty creative not going to lie.
From the A.C....to the wall...till the ac drips down my ballz..ooo these contractors foul.
Crazy. They couldn’t even bother to use duct tape!! 😂
That ac is in a shitty location and a window unit to boot. Cant place a condensation line cuz it located above the entrance. Someone will sue you for slipping on the water on sidewalk.
who puts an air conditioner above a door? that's my question. looks like a safety hazard without angle brackets.\nplus it has to drip somewhere.. on customers? guess that's the city for ya!
Looks like something a Mexican would have done,you know those brilliant border jumpers we must have here because of their talents
Well you cheap bastard , shouldn't gone with a licensed contractor!
I would of attatched a tray to the bottom of the unit, with a pvc connector funneling the water to a pipe running down the wall to the sidewalk. Itd work and look much better!
Well, I guess those claims that Trump didn't pay contractors might be for crap like that then
holy shit\ni should move over there if contractors over there are so shit lol\ni couod do good just by being able to do a normal job lol
please, save your money next time and buy yourself a better camera
You're telling me you don't have a spare iPhone to record this with, Louis? Yeesh...
This guy sounds like he should be eating a calzone and grabbing his vick
That's highly unacceptable.
Did the video quality go from ok to potato for anyone else? Looks like minecraft
Didn't they show you the repair before they left ? Not all contractors are the same. Just do your homework next time on the guy you decide to hire. Be responsible and you will have better results.
How did an unedited video make it on trending?
Who was the worker? I have work for him
Why would you call a contractor for a window unit ??
I guess you don't take Uber then.
The unit isn't exactly leaking per se, its just hot and humid outside so water is accumulating on the evaporator coil. Looks like that is a packaged window AC which are intentionally slanted to the outside for drainage, rather than running a condensate drain line. Looks like whoever you hired, installed a piece of shit condensate line. The condensate drain can be done cheaply with soldered copper.  I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400. Also, get a quote with a scope of work you both can sign off on, that way you can hold them to a copper line for instance, rather than taped tubes or whatever this guy used. Be specific on the route you want him to run.
What are you talking about? That's exactly how I'd do it.
Did you get an AC repair guy? Because at that point, you're better off buying a new one
I love Donald J Trump!!!
Ah so that's why trump did pay his contractors
Please buy a new camera
I know my father is a contractor... works under a millionaire... and heck I know he would probably bitch slap that other contractor...
Be a man, and fix the damn thing yourself! Jesus, do you also pay a mechanic to put washer fluid in your car too?
That's why I hate the city.
You would have to pay if it was duck tape.
This is why Trump wanted mexicans to build the wall
New York, America's shit hole :)
The reason i dont pay contractors is because im broke
Best I can do is 25¢
Looks like fake. However anything can be spected. That work deserves a big facepalm( and to look for the 4chan's cams).
So how come you didn't fix it yourself
Something tells me this guy did not call an actual contractor. He probably called an unlicensed handyman because he didn't want to pay for an actual tradesman to come out and do the work. At least I hope that's the case.
Congrats on getting on Trending. I’ve been watching you since you were at around 25000 subscribers. Keep up the good work!
I would hand them the traditional payments of my people. A banana shoved into a pile of my own shit. There is nothing more sacred than this as payment for good deeds.
Probably be easier to just get waterproof duct tape and tape the leak
cheap, fast, and good. Can't have all three .
Russian Hack, we call it in Germany =)
Contractor was dumb ass you can't fix that.
Oh yes...this only happens in NYC.
Put your contractor on blast!!!
You New Yorkers have the coolest accent in America.
Don't air conditioners always leak water alittle bit?
Fuck, this is like Hong Kong.
I got a letter saying I had to pay an overdue exorcist bill...\n\nThey said if I didn't, my house would be repossessed.
Seems like a good job to me
Jokes on him, the AC is supposed to leak from there.
I'm not sure what else could be done. AC pulls moisture out of the air, and this particular type of unit releases the moisture out of the back. Some allow you to hook a hose, but that water does have to go somewhere. Many have no connection port as the water is condensed onto the coils and just drops out of the back.
You look like you need some fucking sleep bro
Why in the hell would you put a condensing unit above the front door of your establishment? It's called a Condensing Unit for a reason....it produces water from the heat and humidity in the air! OMG!!! Spoiled city slickers!
Nobody cares if your a real New Yorker
bra
memes gone too far
we trendin bois!!!
Yelp that fucker.
BUT It WORKS !!!
Unions
it works tho
eeeh, foget abooouut it!
Nuke New York
Truth
Seems legit
25 cents for trying
Wtf😂
Trending?
Sue those assholes
Louis you're trending :D
AC's drip water. That's how they work. Your car AC does the same. What is your proposed solution for this? The guy could have routed a pipe along the glass hidden in some material but then you'd be paying a helluvalot and still complaining. Given the location of the AC, what's your solution?
Not sure what else he wanted. its an AC system. its gonna leak.
You got what you paid for cheap skate.   AC units condensate.  Putting it over a doorway is stupid, it needs to have the condensate piped elsewhere.  It would have been expensive to hard pipe it to the ground so you told him you wanted the cheapest fix.  You got it.  Behold your cheapness in all its glory.
license and unlicense contractors. Don't hire a unlicensed contractor and bash real license contractor.
He does realize that those wall units do leak condensation and your head is not supposed to walk under them, it's not his fault you installed it into a stupid place.
It's New York, who cares. Everything is trashy and dirty there.
Well, this is what happens when you go cheap. Rather pay an actual contractor or some guy who says he'll fix the issue? You're just a bigot blaming contractors, reminds me of someone who blames a whole group of people for something committed by an individual.
I've been in the HVAC industry since 2002.  This was a hack job.  But in their defense it's a window unit, they don't make an after market drain pan for these units.  What did they charge ?    I would have installed a auxiliary condensate pump below it then ran the vinyl tubing to a downspout or corner to drain.  The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from a location.  The moisture leaves the evaporator coil and sent in this case to the condenser then flung into the condenser dropping head pressure and discharge temps.  Increasing efficiency whatever is left drips out.
He got what he was willing to pay for. A hack contractor at $40 to fix it. \nGood ain't cheap and cheap ain't good. \nThe only solution I see is building a shallow drip pan, instal, seal it and hard pipe it down to the ground. I guarantee they wouldn't want to pay what that would cost to stop the condensation drip.
Do a makeup video including your new express your selfie products xx

Just think, if Bryshere was as homophobic as a lot of yall niggas, he would still be sittin home on youtube commentin on videos instead sittin on the BC gettn interviewed. Lol grow tf up and u will glow tf up!
We watched this on a flat screen I look around and everybody in the living was frowning like they was about to throw up shit ain't natural
Very weird. .. I'm out !
This nigga super gay I'm out
Yall complain when a black director makes movies about slavery.. yall complain about white directors making movies about slavery.. yall complain that theres TOO MUCH movies about slavery and yall complain when theres not enough movies about slavery... CAN WE CHOOSE ONE THING TO BE UPSET ABOUT DAMN! \nAnd I felt like Bryshere had the loop of the teacup being stirred playing in his head this whole interview.. anyway much success to Lee
I bet the shades are covering his water filled eyes,his whole self looks sad like he just wants to cry. hopefully he didn't give his body up for this fame ,he really looks depressed.
I love my kids He sound like Michael
I Pray someone is not using their hollywood powers to sexually extort and control this young man,,shame on you if so,, the vibe was very uncomfortable to watch!! Something is very wrong with this pair. Love you Bry
Something is off about this interview,, I'm catching gay vibes from Bryshers
This interview was cringeworthy.  @ 22:48 bryshere caught hisself tho, he almost slipped up So the Miami trip where we fell.......  Both these niggas suspect af.
lee stay strong and leave the haters in the dust
empire better have ratings through the fckin ROOF with all these commercials\non here today. 😩😩😩
Is this shit old bruh? Niggas acting like this season 1
Bryshere look like the donkey from shrek when i was looking at his teeth.
Oooh, Bayard Rustin! I remember there was a documentary on him called, The Other Brother. It was on cable LONG ago. He definitely deserves a widely released film. Yeees 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love Lee Daniels, but this was the one of the hardest to watch interviews I've ever seen on the BC.  Lee's interview on the Marc Maron Podcast is really good.  Lord Bryshere should have been left at home.  I couldn't get through this mess, way too much effort to get through..
breakfast club, y'all FAKE... why you ain't tell Lee to stop cursing? 😂😂😂
I am I the only one that thinks both Lee and Bryshere were high off something
That was a really, really great interview 🙌
The look on Mr Lee face when yaz exposed saying he on a 360 deal LMAOOO!! 13:15
Niggas on the thumbnail look like two dragon ball z villains jus arriving to earth before the show goes off
Man Yazz if you don't get yo whisper song talking ass out of here!  TALK...lol... Still watching Empire tonight :-)
This whole interview feels like i’m watching an episode of Law & Order SVU, and the child is so scared of his abuser,  he looks for approval before completing his sentences....  \n\nCharlemagne is the abusers attorney and Angela Yee & Envy are Stabler & Liv trying to catch this dude in a lie to book him....\n\nand the back glass is the 2 way interview room mirror where the captain and the child psychologist watch hoping they slip up in their story.. *Queue up dramatic music*
Interesting. Lee, quit playin'. You are definitely still gettin' high. And you have something sexual w/ Bryshere. Hell, any foo' can see it. Bryshere is so numb to it all (figuratively). It's best that you keep yo' shades on, Bryshere. Yo' eyes will say something that yo' mouth won't. Lee, I had no idea that you were on crack, powder and crystal. Again, interesting...
Say what y'all want about CTHG he is a star and culture mover,This nigga wild asked Lee Daniels to do For da🍆Challenge man that's just Genius 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He had Bryshere screaming oh big daddy all night long when he was blowing his back out..
I’m so use to seeing Hakeem so aggressive on the show it was weird watching him ok here he seems socially awkward
Let mr lee live people ..he is great he is changing peoples lives
I love The Breakfast Club but I can't watch this. Empire is garbage. LMAO!
i wish they wouldn't whisper i have my volume up and i can't hear well
Someone shud of asked yaaz how it felt f***ing his tv brothers real life wife 😂
I thought this interview would be a little more interesting...
They doin the nasty for sure
this interview LITERALLY put me to sleep while listening at work..omg get some energy guys
They really didn't know who Khandi Alexander or Bayard Rustin are!? 🙄🙄
Meh. When is POWER back on
Bru I been stop watching this show  fucc  Empire #power
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
lee daniels aka lil sweet defies the laws of gravity...it's the sweet one!   hakeem  has already laid pipe lee to daniels it's obvious
it doesn't feel like they even wanna be there...way off!!
Beyshere lying ass. He ain't get kicked out. I can tell by his phony ass story.
I want to MAKE MYSELF VERY CLEAR, I AM NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, BUT PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE....when these actors & actresses wear sunglasses, that's because they have been TURNED OUT and/or have been involved in some form of elite rituals (and not in the way you think as others have stated) in Hollyweird!  Based on the research that I've done AND MOST OF ALL...USING MY COMMON SENSE & INTUITION like most of you all are doing.  Because I'm even looking at some of your comments below, and your spirit or gut intuition doesn't lie! You all are sensing that something is not right about this interview, and that is why! People are beginning to wake back up and USE OUR SOUND MIND THAT THE FATHER gave us! IJS!
I am just here for the comments
Why are they whispering? It's really hard to hear especially when Bryshere is speaking.
Just like Chilli in the TLC interview, Bryshere should've been left in the lobby.
I don't even  notice when DJ Envy is missing during interviews
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES IT SEEM LIKE HE MESSING WITH THE BOY? 
Charlamagne wanted to say more but he was holding back lool
Why is the vocal and age off at the end
LMBO, HE MIGHT BE THE ONLY GUEST THEY'VE HAD THAT EXITED HIMSELF BEFORE THEY ENDED THE INTERVIEW.....BOSS!! 😅😅
Lol@CMTG telling Bryshere to write Lee so e lyrics for the dick challenge
Why does everyone think that this interview was akward? I'm lost..
Loved the interview.  Lee Daniels is very real transparent.
Y'all need to start having practice interviews with some of the people before goig on air..This dude on here whispering sounding all weird and awkward..Then Charlagmne tellin him he sound weird on air is extra awkward..This whole interview was weird and awkward ..Hakeem got thrust into the spotlight extremely fast then come to an interview with shades on..seems like he is going to have a weird relationship with Lee Daniels and grow up on set ultimately creating an identity crisis.
I'm crying at the comments 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Y'all so ignorant! 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
This interview is weird and I think Lee is messing with that young boy!
What's crazy is how people are here insisting that there is a homosexual relationship going on between the two just because Yaz's boss is a homosexual man. Smh... You guys are exposing your own perverted minds.  I work with gay people, they don't want you they have their own lives. They come to work and do their jobs just like anyone else.
Man don’t nobody give a shit about Lee Daniels or that weak ass show.
The older brother but why the young guy there did he talk
How hard was it for you not to hate those kids That was the dumbest question I've ever heard Charlamagne ask... at 3 days old, looking at two little innocent beings, how can one feel hate for that, whether that's biological yours or not smh. *sidenote, I went to college with his son but he dropped out after the first semester of freshmen year. I didn't realize it was his son until after he left and I randomly saw him on Lee Daniels Instagram one day and put two and two together lol.
I’ve tried so hard to finish this interview lol
Lee Daniels kept trying to straighten out bangs and a ponytail that didn't exist... moisture farmer
This young nigga geting weird on us. All that soft talk....
I'm gonna let you finish but Dennis Schroder has the best blonde patch in the game!
Well Big Daddy Lee call auntie Mo Mo and tell her how you really feel lols
I wish envy was here to say put your mouth up to the mic 😕😎
Majority of the people commenting did not even watch the interview.
I've never seen BG so strange in interviews. What's going on between him and Lee? What when down before those cameras started rolling?
Yaz comes off very awkward...almost painful to watch. 🤦🏾‍♀️
WEIRD INTERVIEW LOL
Awkward.
Bryshere calls Lee “Big Daddy”.
45:37 Charla's laugh floored me LOL
I apologize...good interview
Lee was being honest.. but you can tell when he lies.. Nia Long, and Mo'Nique... those were lies.. you can tell by his actions.
Why is Bryshere acting like that?! He's been on the breakfast club before snd he came with energy and a great personality. What happened? I hope Hollywood didn't get to his head
WTF!! when Lee homo Daniels was saying YAZ!YAZ!YAZ!YAZ! and he was spanking like he was pumping the young homie smfh That is a predator sitting there with his victim WOW 😂😂😂
Maybe he's acting more reserve bc it's early asf & lee Daniels IS HIS BOSS ...
Lee is definitely lying about blackballing Monique. His entire answer just makes you turn yo face up, like you had to know this was going to be asked and you had nothing better to answer with. Bryshere is high doing all that low talking. Star & Empire are my shows but Lee's energy is off.
No weird vibe ... I take that back . This interview is motivational. I love the talk about the ART and UPLIFTING EACH OTHER💪🏾.  Respect Lee!
Faggot lol
Lee Daniels seems obnoxious and he keeps interrupting ppl
Tight fade Bryshere! Dope!
Hope you're alright Hakeem !!!
Y is he hitting Charla ... omg
This seemed awkward. Mane speak up young nigga
Did anybody catch wen charlamangne said...do u ask big daddy for permission...an hakeem said new edition...watch charlamagnes reaction...43:00
that  pillow biter  lee  turnt that  young nigga out
wtf....lmaoooo 7:37 YAZZ..YAZZ..YAZZ OOOH YAZ ..HE DEFINITELY BENDING LEE OVER
Whats with the whispers? 🤔🙄
Mofaya Sbu Leope is pushing this energy drink.

🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Petyr Baelesh  my boy left westeros and came here
I don't know why I find maze runners interesting.
0:29  that scene looked similar to Logan movie scene of train
like seriously i can't wait for this movie.
I'm gonna cry when newt dies😭
The manga was better
this movie confirms that Arya uses Petyr Baelish's face and that she successfully saved the world from white walkers
It's kinda funny how people who thinks they're SUPER FANS of the books and start saying bad things of the movie, please shut up and enjoy, it doesn't matter if it's not exactly as the books, it stills being really good.
250...Thats all I have to say
When the writers, director, producers, actors, and everyone who worked on this movie didnt read the books
i cant wait to see the movie
They better do page 250 justice, I want to bawl in the cinema
Roses are Red\nViolets are Blue\nI wasn't first\nAnd neither were you
I so hope they make a movie of The Fever Code
Sonya is Newts sister in the books. Her real name Is Lizzy and Thomas' real name is Stephen.
Spoiler they find the cure
I read all of the books and i have seen both of the movies im so ready for this movie❤❤
I'M SO CLOSE TO GETS 1000 SUBS  AN YOU GIVE A SMALLER SHOT ? I'M JUST LIKE ANY YOU TUBER .... !!\nI NEED A SUBSCRIBERS AS WELL SO IF YOU HELP ME I'LL HELP YOU !!
The Maze Runner is so over rated
Am a fan of the maze runner I read all the maze runner series
If this is as slow and boring as the last one, at least I'll get some sleep.
FINALLY I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER!!!!!
i don't remember this in the book
THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME!
I know this movie isn't gonna be half what the book was and I don't even care cause maze runner
I have been waiting so long for this and finaly the put a hard work in it
REPLY IF YOU THINK IT IS GONNA BE LIKE THE BOOK OR NOT
It’s been so long since I watched the movies!!! Time to rewatch the series!!! can’t believe it has to be at the end of January instead of the beginning
You know how long I’ve been waiting for this yaaaaaaasssssssssss
How to cause a fight:\n\n\nTeresa and Thomas or Brenda and Thomas?
I liked the first movie but now it's not even about a maze anymore 🤷‍♂️
what if instead of newt it's changed to minho? iykwim
Im the biggest mazr runner geek in the world
I see Dylan I click\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was also uploaded on my birthday 🎉
Can you guys help me get to 100 subscribers!!! Thank you 😊
I NEED TO WATCH THE FULL MOVIE
I make terrible YouTube Videos \nhttps://youtu.be/71mtIeBn6I8\nSee how terrible they are!
i thought that this was was fake at first, but then I looked at the channel and sub count
Finally!!!!! Can't wait to watch it!!!!! 🙌
I want to see this movie so bad
1. God said Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned? (Al-mukminun : 115), 2. God said Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators. (Al-mukminun : 14).
I'm watching so happily and then I figure out the scene where he got hurt and my face goes from 😀 To 😟
I'm not ready yet emotionally for that film
I want to see this movie already
This movies kind of have the feeling of mad max idk why
Lord Baelish back is at it again
Hey were is the other dude that got caught in the 2 maze runner
I've been waiting for this
Omg please do all these do all these movies PLEASE
I'm just here to catch a glimpse of Alita
I’m so excited but I bet that have of y’all haven’t even read the books but hopefully it’s good 🙏
Bro i have been waiting and waiting for this!!!!!
Everyone complains about how inaccurate the movie is going to be compared with the book, but has anyone thought that the book is inaccurate to the movie? :>
that moment when you're still waiting for an actual star wars 8 trailer to release
Where are the Vampires and the girl who has no fear?  The werewolf without a shirt?!  I am sure they were in this movie....  or was it being hungry and on fire?
Does anyone know when in the future this takes place, I think it Takes place between the 2040 and 2050 because Alec in the kill order book says back in the 20s we breach in a house full of crack pots and in the kill order we can infer that he's in his 50s or 60s.
Omg I can't wait any longer!! 😝
THANK YOU LORD HE HAS RECEIVED MY PRAYERS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT I REALLY HAVE TO SEE IT
O man can't wait for it to come out and it will be amazing like the rest of the movies were 👍

ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
Hello?!
Omg thank you ive been waiting forever
AHHHHHH THANK U SANTA MY WISH CAME TRUEEEE!!!
This the most cliché trailer I have ever seen.\n\n0:02 - Starts with action scenes and questions\n0:27 - Action music begins with the clicking of something\n0:30 - Reading and impactful airhorn sounds begin playing\n0:32 - Question that doubts the capabilities of the protagonist\n0:37 - Optimistic response to question\n0:38 - Bunch of gunfire and explosions\n0:43 - More reading\n0:44 - Question that is answered with a pessimistic answer that is shouted for no reason\n0:47 - Even more reading\n0:48 - Entire action scene (which is usually the best one in the movie) spoilt\n0:54 - Question by an important character that leaves protagonist split between two decisions\n\nHave a feeling this movie is gonna be a huge let down.
So I’ve read the books and I’m obsessed with them. I haven’t watched any of the movies because I’ve heard how inaccurate they are. From watching this trailer I’m glad at my decision. From what I remember of the books, this is nothing like them.
Don't get to see mino (Asian guy)
Where my dawg Minho tho? (T＿T)
Where's Gally?\n\nWell the Cast say Gally is on with it
Vox, if you're going to do a story about internet in rural areas you need to mention the High Cost Program, a support mechanism of the Universal Service Fund (USF).  The high cost program is a $4.2 Billion fund that subsidizes Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) for providing telecommunication services in rural and high cost areas.  This is how people in the areas in this segment get their broadband services.  This is also the program, managed by the FCC, that is working to cut the broadband gap.  People need to be informed of this if they want to change the current status of broadband build-out in this country.
I'm watching this video while having really slow internet and whole lot of buffers.... 😣
This video presents no support at all for its central argument.\nThe health, education, and financial differences are much more easily explained as a rural\urban difference than a fast internet\slow internet one. Faster internet will not make hospitals and schools closer for rural Americans.\nI absolutely agree every American needs affordable access to the internet, but 10Mb\s is much more than enough. \nHeck, 1Mb\s would be sufficient for streaming low-def video and education\banking purposes.
Proof that libertarians are wrong
25/3?\nI'm just gonna run a speed test\nI got 12/1\nNailed it.
Good at home WI-FI and Amzazing Mobile Data you can even get download speeds of up to 1gb per seco nd with in home wifi but I think only from AT and T
Screw this! I live in a populous suburban city (Roseville, CA), and even we don't have affordable broadband!!!
I have 5m down, 1m up\n\nDo you wanna know where?\n\n...\n\nNo, I'm not from the U.S.A, I'm from Colombia. Yes, there is better Internet services available, but they are too expensive.
10mb/s is fine i lived with that because my router was sucky it is enough to watch videos and download stuff this is ridiculous
I get 119 Mbps per second download and 30 Mbps upload in the suburb of Kansas City
Although I agree with the sentiment of the message, it leaves off several details that are of extreme importance.\n\nFirst, Satellite Internet at Broadband Speeds is available to essentially all Americans today from multiple providers.  It is not a great tool for gaming but does meet the Broadband Requirement.  Thus, the first mistake is that the map shown is, in fact, a wireline map.  It does not include any form of wireless - including Satellite.\n\nSecond, there is an entire part of the story left off of the REA story.  That of the RUS - Rural US Telephone service.  Many of those same communities had started telephone service and under the REA the RUS was formed to help subsidize rural phone service.  There are around 1,100 local incumbent telephone companies in the US.  The big names (Verizon, AT&T, Frontier, Centurylink, Fairpoint) you probably have heard of.  But there are plenty of companies like TDS or East Otter Tail Telephone, or Copper Mountain Telephone in the US.\n\nThese small companies tend to have very good networks because they are subsidized by all of us.  If you see a charge for USF (Universal Service Fund), that is where that money goes to the tune of several $B per year.  Many of these companies are Co-Ops and are owned by the local town.  The biggest problem areas are rural properties of the large companies as they do not receive these subsidies.  They base their builds around their Return on Investment (ROI) and Rural Broadband falls behind Data Centers, Mobile Networking, Enterprise Fiber Optic Networks all the time.  They will simply never be built based on their value.\n\nThird, Wireless Internet (WISPs) exist and are good in some areas.  We are struggling with spectrum and line of sight issues and it is difficult get permits to build towers.  It can be a solution a bit, but most of the residential WISP connections that exist today do not meet the 25/3 definition of broadband.  It is not likely this is going to change soon.\n\nFinally, the solution hinted at existed in the Phone World that came about as part of the Telecom Act of 1934.  POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) was made a Universal Service.  That means that if you build a house, the telephone company must bring you a phone line.  Not might, not should, but must by law.  I worked on equipment that supported a cabin that had a 100 mile distance to the CO that served it.  That line was not cost effective, but that is why the subsidies exist (and are under the gun to be eliminated).  If we want Universal Broadband, then we need to legislate Universal Broadband.  It is the only way.
Eh, in Utah the internet is alright. It ain't super fast, and losing wifi is super easy but it ins't terrible.
meanwhile, in sweden..Fiber is the most normal here. 100 down and 50 up usually.
Funny how they put down 4G even though it seems to be be really popular in those poor rural areas.  Those Kenyans sure must be way wealthier than Americans are because of all that fast internet they've got, right?  Right???
I need sources for this video, because I live in one of those areas that you claim can not get 25mps download and I pay for 200 and my google speed test says I get about 150mps and about 30 up.......
Took em 5 minutes to get the the point their video's, bashing Trump.
I love the music.
I'm hearing internet is intrinsically good? Meh, difficult to get on that boat.
my pc cant be broadband speed but my moms can why? my pc cant pick up signal ez
10 mbs is perfectly fine for accessing government sites. This video is completely bs
The video falls just short of talking about BPL: Broadband over power lines. Seems to me like an obvious and complimentary solution to balloons, drones, and/or the use of radio white spaces.
When I heard the noice I thought the nuclear bombs were launched
Just waiting for the movement were sjw demand free internet
Please before you make comments about liberal blah blah blah. Just stop, this isn't a political issue. There are many countries around the world that have cheaper internet than we do that is faster. This is the modern era people, we need internet. Work is done online, school is done online, everyday things are done online. America needs to catch up, this is why we need to make utility within the coming 20 years or so.  Plus why would you hate the idea of it being a utility? Set a  current standard for 1080p since that is currently what is being widely used, then upgrade it to 4k usage. \n\nWe need to catch up. Too much greed in these monopoly ISPs
The US is soooooo far behind it's laughable.
Upper Peninsula of Michigan gets very little internet 😢😞
I get 50mbs for 55 bucks a month
MY VIDEO HAD TO BUFFER DURING THIS AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Too bad they won't ever see this
The government just needs to enforce that all building connections must be 500mbps fiber. That will get all ISPs moving fast to get that dark fiber up and running to each house and business across the country. They can't possibly squeeze that much speed out of copper. I'd like to see them try.
believe it or not where i live i have a 2Mbps{250KBps} broadband connection
You are more successful thus you chose to live in a wealthier (broadband) area. The wifi doesn't determine you, you determine the wifi.
The graph showing germany having high speed mobile makes me sick. \nMy mobile connection at home is faster than my wired one, but they all use data packages, which are expensice, and its not reliable.\nJust give me fibre already.
28kbs download here, watching from school because the schools guest wifi is better than my own. thanks, cheap grandparents
Whats up with the Dakotas at 1:14? Anybody know why theres such a difference between those states and Nebraska?
AT&T has low signal all the time
I play my games on a WiFi mobile extension
Americans have got it good in terms of internet speed. Come to the land down under and you will see what slow internet is like
10 miles from London. 3mbps. Download speed. Get wrecked.
2.2 Mbps.One day it hopefully will be fixed.
Here in Philadelphia, we have fast wi-fi and fast data. Also, the broadband thing is the one of the only things Trump has done that I don't care about, or that I even like. P.S. I am posting this comment on 5gHZ wifi\n\nEdit: Oh, wait, Trump took it back
Way Better Alternative:\nAlthough I love wires because they are healthy and secure... they are stupid to waste money on old tech infrustructure. Instead they should leap frog to the new ways, such satilites that provide 100MB download/upload speeds. These already exist. The French have offered it to most parts of the world from USA south (I'm Canadian and I know it's not available here). The money would be much better spent this way, with the use of relay towers on the ground. It seems as if this plan is just a mafia move to give money to the current powerful landline companies, by substidizing them to get more customers. Another alternative is an upgrade from 4g to 5g with cellphone companies. 5g has existed for many years but has yet to go mainstream. Upgrading would be way cheaper and faster the ground wires.... the only benifit of the ground wires is that it will employ labour workers for awhile, which perhaps part of his job agenda.
Free Internet for 8 billion brains. All will reach singularity.
The video actually stopped because my internet is too slow and for a second I thought it was Vox messing with me again.
Stop dissing trump He may not b the best but he’s here. And he’s trying to help. And don’t say u aren’t u r just cherry picking facts so tell everything ab everyone or the just the good ab everyone. Don’t b bias.
B-b-b-but that's socialism! Jk we don't mind footing the bill for rural internet. If we're gonna tell the FCC the internet should be treated like a utility for net neutrality then we gotta treat it like a utility in terms of government spending as well.
None of us have fast internet
Is this what Project Loon is aiming to fix?
In Trinidad the basic internet is 30mbs download and 5 upload for about US$35 a month. It’s widely adopted to the point where it’s unusual to see places without high speed internet access.
You fail to mention how expensive satellite based internet service is
It sucks here in Nevada where I live...
Dropping the high speed Internet standard so that you can say  more Americans now have high speed Internet than ever before, especially rural Americans is about the same as dropping the grade needed for a letter grade in school so that more children can get a higher grade on their report card. You don't drop the standard so that more people can hit the standard, you raise the standard so more people can strive towards that new standard.\n\nI thought this was America.
We are actually doing this in Australia - rolling out a National Broadband Network (NBN) across a nation of wide open spaces. Rural areas have been prioritised over urban areas in the roll-out timeline. Unfortunately due to the politicisation of the project (with the two major left and right leaning politicial parties taking opposing sides) it has been a big clusterf**k. It'll be interesting to see if the benefits ultimately outweigh the costs. There would be important lessons here for the USA if it ever embarked on implementing a federal broadband model. Watch this space!
Internet is a privilege, not a right.
5:04 DID VOX JUST SAY SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT TRUMP?
01:19 This correlation does not equal causation.\nYou're grasping at straws here.
Come to Australia, where they are forcing us to move to 'faster' internet, (trust me, it's not) otherwise they'll cut our already existing 'slow' internet and where we are rank 53 on the list of global average internet speeds. (The U.S is 9) http://www.speedtest.net/global-index
I refreshed the page at the start, I thought I was laging.
What's the point of giving rural areas faster internet? So they can get their brain washed by facebook fake news faster??
Internet should be a publicly operated utility, like water or electricity. Having said that, if your dumbass rural shithole county voted for trump, then Im glad you get to stay trapped in the 20th century. Just like you like it.
Meanwhile in Australia...
literally first world problems
25Mbps is super fast enough!
me:sees title\n\nMe:WHY 24 MILLION AUSTRALIANS DONT HAVE WIFI\n\nHELP USSS
Ofcourse Trump cant do anything right.
Because they're poor. /video

Australia bro
Lol Trumps standards are so low...
Well I sure am lucky i live in Central Texas with my 300meg internet speed. :D
100% of UK citizens have over priced, bad internet
Because its a monopoly and not a free market. Competition leads to better prices and faster speeds.
This is definitely true here in Montana. There will be times where the Internet is fast and times when we have no internet. The worst part is that there is nothing to do here. I go fishing sometimes and grow fruits in my backyard. Can’t wait till I’m done with high school. I wanna move to Seattle! It’s very nice there.
When rural people get welfare Republicans support it. When poor people in other areas.... nope
I live in Germany an I have got 200Mbps Down / 50Mbps up  50$ a month
To be specific, 10mbps is roughly equivalent to SPRINT because they suck and not even close to TMobile or AT&T. Furthermore, 10mbps isn't even enough to watch HD YouTube or make a VoIP call
Because satellites don't exist as described. Obviously
Well I thought it was common sense that if you go to the middle of nowhere you ain't going to get good internet, common sense
In Sweden even summer houses often have fiber, and they might be in the middle of nowhere
Be glad it isn't the NBN we have over here in Australia because Fibre to the Node/Cabinet is apparently the future
90 a month for about 5-6 Mbps
Yo you know what?\n\n\n*Read more*
Here in Canada we’ve been stuck at 15down/2up for years.
Capitalism fails again. When will the bourgeois even learn?
Wouldn't it possibly be an idea to lift taxes on investment in broadband infrastructure development in underserved / rural areas? That way it's cheaper for the broadband provider to invest and do business and the government only loses tax income it would have spent and had to take out of people's pockets anyway. The average person pays nothing more (directly) than they already do.
This is what you get when you let carriers decide how the wording in laws should be. Here in Norway, I live in a rural area and have a fiber connection with no data caps. Right now I have 150/150Mbps, but can easily upgrade up to 1Gbps/1Gbps if I want to. I could even get 10Gbps if I wanted. \nOh well.... keep on dreaming about your american dream while your government screws you. While the rest of the world conquers the future.
When I see comments with people saying they got internet speeds under 1Mbps for insanely high money I just wonder why the heck they don't move. Like you have a job here that's holding you back but you loose like 10% of the income on the internet and probably live in a total shithole with no civilization? Yah, totally worth it
Screw vox
And here in Middlesbrough (north east England) my Internet is pretty damm fast and it’s unlimited 😁
I don't like playing online with Americans. Most of you are overly butthurt and have trash WiFi and blame anyone but yourselves.
Vox kinda defended Trump? WHAT
60mbps down/6mbps up... here
Lol first world problems
Vox always has to bash Trump on something. Its interesting that there complaining he hasn't revealed his plan yet, but I would say North Korea is a more pressing issue. You know, worry about a plan on internet rather that nuclear warfare. But the problem is that there won't be any place to put this internet if America is getting bombed and destroyed!
Explains why Donald Trump won the election (23% of population in rural areas have no access to the internet)
One thing. Living in those rural areas EVERYTHING costs less. So internet being expensive is not that big of a deal. We pay 1300 for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment and a lot in taxes here in California so yeah...
No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
Do you hate scousers.. erm... haha I love the hesitation.
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
that moment when you leave Gary Neville hanging
Gary being interviewed by the British Seth Rogan!!!
Confused when seeing the thumbnail; thought it was prankster EdBassmaster pulling one of those funny faces.
lFC  you'll never win the league  ha ha ha come back when youve  won 18 ha
manchester city will win the league
Lifelong Liverpool fan and have always liked Gary Neville ... he hated us and we hated him ...a born winner he was a top quality player and very solid guy
Yip, Jose has never hung around that long at clubs. \nBut he's never been manager at a club like this and all that we encompass ❤️
Amazing work. Been awhile since you uploaded anything, that was definitely worth waiting for! Happy to have one video a year if that video ends up being a sit down with a United legend.
Great Interview!
Cranium Giganticus
Absolutely
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
The intro made me skip to another video.
Great interview
Gaz.. get the guitar
Don't want Suarez. Thanks.
amazing interview
Can not believe neville has actually just said he would love suarez at united might be a really good player but after what he did to evra i would never want him anywhere near man united
Brilliant vid
Peroni   lovely  lager
Lol how'd you manage this, nice one.
I am a Everton fan and a Scouser Gary would have been a great central defender he was to short though but Rio was quality .
This guy fufilled every manc kids dream. \nFair play to him, always stayed humble and loyal. Respect
Quality interview
city winnin the CL is a bigger deal than LFC winnin the PL. im a man utd fan by the way
Gary Neville is a true United legend, bless him!
Corona is Mexican Mr Neville ;-)

Welcome to manchester  united #mo10 #kingofasist
Where should Blake take his speed gun and tape measure next?\n\nLet us know 👇
Haha Blake you're awesome
this guy sounds like gradeAunderA
very interesting
#askGMBN Has Blake dyed his hair 😂
Sayonara measuring tape! RIP :D That was pretty funny.
Bing bong foreman
That is insane.
Did Blake ride this trail?
Your beard = super nice
Says sayonara (a japanese word) quite well but says tradectory funny. Awesome vid Me Shram! 😊
Holly shi* 😲
😂

sweet spot....!! hahahaha
My manhood is 1/5th intact >.<
Aweome video!🤘👌
Sick 20th on trending
Tadrectory     ;)
Sweetspot
4:50 Hahahaha Blake the DUDEEEEEEEE
This is properly terryfying!
Get blake invited here
Excellent video
Incredible!!!
Amazing video 😆
Thought Blake brought his hair dryer
Metrics Blake..use metrics, its 21st century O_o\n(thumbs up for postedit adding conversion)
Cmon blake you could pin those!!!  Make sure gmbn has good insurance for ya though b4 u hit it!  Lol
I think Blake is trying to copy Finn Iles hair..?
its insane they have berms right after the huge jumps!
I do 40ft gap jumps rather often. but these hardline jumps are not only long, they are technical, in the way that they boost the riders up, and the run in's are crazy rough
Would love to see Blake and The Don take on this mega-beast of a course! Problem is, could GMBN afford the insurance?!
I wanna see you ride it.
I want to see Blake riding THIS! :-D
c'mon we all want to see Blake clearing those obstacles...
I stay Up to 3am Singapore Time Just To watch GMBN Videos When They Get Released
incredible! \nthanks for the numbers. i know that most of the real life look of things is lost over film so hearing just how big the features are makes it just that much more crazy
I could listen to Blake saying trajectory all day.
It's by far the most gnarliest
Leogang DH course had longer jump in the bottom, until Remi Thirion heavily crashed
Dan Atherton. You are a nutter.
All the talk of sweets makes me hungry
Blake's hair is looking SICK!! You crack me up every video Blake, keep up the rad work. \n\nGAGA WHOOOSH!! 👌
Can Blake ride this stuff.
I like the way he says here.
Where's the sweet spot 😂
would be interesting to see how the WC tracks measure up to this beast...
You should have done this in LooseFest, where the jumps are +25 meters long :P
I was wondering whether Blake ever tried the track himself. And if not would he ever see himself actually trying this?
Yeah you really need to get your tradektry right for that road jump.
This video is like the Wasp Factory.
You need courage to ride there.  Thanks for the video.
Blake looks a bit like Charlie Hunnam in this video. That course is insane.
Wow, even bigger then I imagined!  Blake needs to hit that
please forgive my ignorance but what exactly is red bull hardline? is it like red bull rampage?
That's insane! I love videos like this
I went 45mph on my road bike, and when I became conscious of just how fast I was going, and really felt the way my bike was controlling, I felt my stomach drop and became hyperaware of everything.  To think that I would hit a 45ft gap after obtaining that kind of speed makes my knees shake just thinking about it.
Yeah! Was looking forward to this video from GMBN!
Gwin did not have an invite eh?
He said big 10 times, and he said huge 5 times
Is Blake gonna send it?
Wow you should do more like This it was very interesting to watch
a few extra feet could be added to the measurements to account for the arch of most of the jumps too
Do a video like this at Rampage!
40 MPH on an MTB. What the heck!? Insane.
Craig Evans is the fucking man!
Come give our edits a watch any constructive criticism would be really appreciated, want to hear what we can do to make our stuff better!!
Would any of you GMBN guys have the bottle to hit any of those features?
Excellent edit! And thank you for the metric values!
*Rob Warner voice*WHAT 2 GMBN VIDEOS ARE ON TRENDING OH MY GOD
Bike vault photo in the making at 6:19, love it
wow... im humbled ... i dont think i could hit ANY of that!
Nope... Nope and more Nope.  The fact that so few riders even make final due to injury on the course shows how hard it is.   Anyone who gets down in one piece - especially given it was wet this year - is a bloody hero IMO.
And Adam Brayton rips a tear-off off his goggles mid-air into dirty ferns\n\nThat is even more impressive!
and this kids, is when you need math to know how far the landing is, simple pythagoras.... 5:10
Remember back in the day doing 8' drops and thinking we were champs! This is just mad!
Awe where was my shout out for making you a brew at the top?!!!
you need someone at rampage this year
Another great video. Now Blake should shred it!!!!!!!
#askgmbn I want to ride megavalance next year but I'm not sure if i should ride with flat or clipless pedals
Getting a ton of merch for Christmas
Blake, are you going to do a claudio caluori of the track in your next vid? lol
I really wanna see the bing bong shreds this trail.\nI know you capable doing this..
I love the concept of this video, it really shows how crazy big those fearures are
I thought this video was sick
Blake could hit those gaps and drops for sure. And I guess he should ride there too.
I died as blake said sayonara and dropped the tape!
Impressive...and insane. Thank you for the metric values!
Speed gun and tape measure at redbull rampage
#20 on trending how many more videos can you get on trending
I hoped Blake would take part at Hardline :(
Red Bull Hardline 2018 Blake?
Your R sound is coming along nicely, dude.\nLol, such a chiller, love this guy.
This is trending ?
4:45 thank me later
Hey Blake do you think you could survive it? Just curious
But could/would you ride it blake/scott/Neil ?
Where  can I get one of those coats
Did they skip that huge drop during race? I can't spot it in winner's POV video.
I love what kindness Klopp, Solanke, and Gini gave to him, this is a great treasure in life. This has really made my day, #YNWA
How could someone watch that and dislike!!! Also new found love for Gini that smile and embrace 👌
Arsenal fan here, just wanna say what an absolute geezer Klopp is! Much respect.
Absolutely amazing love this so much he is an inspiration ❤️❤️
what a great lad c:
Shit like this always makes me cry man
Im an arsenal fan but that is great of jurgen to do this!
God I love Gini so much
Lovely young lad and very kind of Liverpool.
Class act from Klopp, this coming from a United fan.
كلوب 😍❤
Brilliant
Magnificent
fucking cute
Gini <3
When Gini hugged him:)
He brought smiles and onions with him.
United fan coming in! Klopp seems like an outstanding person. You are very lucky to have him as your manager.
i smiled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor all the wrong reasons
I love Jurgen klopp, he is just so humble and nice\n\n- Chelsea fan
Wow! great and very touching video. It made me cry,  this is why I love Liverpool fc so much. Love the vid. Liverpool fc supporter here from the Philippines.
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Makes me happy to see people get a wish no matter how small the wish it's just amazing to see
Enough of the charm offensive, Klopp is a dreadful manager, top 4 perhaps and no cups.  We dream HIGHER.
Klopp is so nice
I am a man in Thailand. I love Liverpool because of this.
Who the fuck disliked this video?
Love the way Klopp talks to him like he's a normal human! Some people feel they need to speak to disabled and mentally slower people like children which must be so patronising! Klopp spoke to this lad in the same time he speaks to everyone which is brilliant!
This kid is probably a better keeper than fucking loris precarious karius
This is just amazing !!
That was a  overwhelming so nice doing things lika that  makes him happy and smiley  interact with him man makes me happy too 👍😀
Every time i was close to to a tear klopp would make me laugh.great video. Hope the club offered him tickets for a game.
He likes Salah for some reason ..? why didn't he choose Coutinho?
thumbs down to those who didnt smile after watching this......
Im a united fan but youtube bought me here ... fab video, great stuff from klopp, a very genuine hug from gini and what a brilliant charity
4:00 You`ll never walk alone kid <3 x
This has genuinely warmed my heart! Can not believe that there are people out there who have disliked this video!!
Make my wish come through and stop wasting chances to score. Fucking head wreckers to watch
i wish klopp would have a shave and brush his teeth...
Who could dislike such a nice video
*Get that kid a free season ticket in the kop end this is the kind support we need in the stadium not the mumbling cunts*
I'm not crying. You're crying
People who disliked this video should honestly be ashamed of themselves 😔😔😔
Jürgen Klopp is genuinely the most amazing person and leader for Liverpool. He loves the club and should be backed 100%.
Loyd also had a wish that Liverpool could score more than one goal with 80 shots on target
I was feeling really miserable today but this has really cheared me up and made me feel warm inside.
Ahhh, bought a tear to my eye 😊
make a wish great initiative
Who's the cunts giving this a thumbs down? Love Klopp! YNWA Loyd
Love this, shows you the true power of football and how it changes peoples life`s. It heals and empowers us.  I`m not even a Liverpool fan in fact I`m a United supporter but that doesn't matter, moments like this matter and need to happen more.
Love klopp what a hero (united fan)
I love this man ❤
This is what football is about respect. Klopp your a true gentleman. Well done to Liverpool F.C. #YNWA
I'm so sad for the kid when klop get the sack 🤧
Ahhh... I hope we win against Spartak he would be really happy
And that's why I love our team and Jurgen. All Class lads all Class.
What a class man. Made that lads day. Respect from a Southampton fan
O my god when he sang YNWA that was amazing
I thought the Proclaimers were Hibs fans?
Quite a lot of people tryna press pause while the screen rotates... only reason I can think of for any dislikes!
This is what makes Jurgen so special he is the normal one and we love him to bits. So glad he is at our great club and hope he stays for a very long time.
All who call for klopps head should watch this video
Amazing how Liverpool will do this for someone with a disability
Who ever disliked this video doesn't have a heart
👊❤❤❤👊YNWA👊❤❤❤👊
Good stuff
The best Coach
Wow
Class act from Klopp 👌
Top class that.
Sweet
Beautiful!
Nothing is guaranteed.
Liverpool=Greatness
Klopp,You amazing man
It Puts things into perspective, Cmon yer Reds!
Klopp seems a lovely bloke
Fantastic video
God bless....
What a good lad Klopp...
Beautiful, good man Klopp!
Never sack Jurgen !!!
Awwwwwww just the best LOYD YNWA 👊🔥💥
Lovely video!
Klopp what a guy
Loyds a red. Ynwa lad.
That wijnaldum hug 😭😭 so genuine ♥️♥️
Klopp - guaranteed to win to nothing
WOW!!! Smiled threw the hole video
So much respect.
Wow
How old is Loyd?
When Klopp laughs; it’s genuine
Gent.
Bless him!
Hwo could dislike this to Lloyd
.
That was amazing 👍❤
I couldent stop smileing 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Just great!!
This is mega!!! It sounds even better than last two great albums and it's fuckin unique
Where is the single?!
Holy shit Noel, these sound good so far!
Being a huge fucking oasis fan, this won’t even compare to his previous albums. If the album follows this theme, could be a disappointment. However it could be a Piece of genius, we are yet to find out
Really dig where Noel's taken his music! Oasis was the paradigm shift in my taste in music, it's what made it improve haha..and things haven't been the same since. Can't wait to see you live in NYC!!
YEAH-ah! I always wanted this Bloody fucking good day-!
Ok. Stop the world. We need Liam and Noel together again! We need ROCK again!
I came from the Liam Gallagher - Greedy Soul Live At Air Studios song and now i'm listening this and shit... both are fucking amazing :O
To be quite honest with you Noel, I'd wish nobody buy your solo's career albums, first of all 'cos they're $hi%, sound like a big pile of $hi% and second 'cos if ppl still buy those album there will be no oasis reunion at all 'cos you don't really need any money nowaydays aren't ya. I like a few songs from your solo career but not as much I do like the entire oasis discography. Music taste is subjetive, you don't give a ##uck what ppl think... as long as they buy your music of course =)
Omg I didn't like that I am gutted 😭😭😭😭
Kinda tired of Liam big mouth... He was more inspired years ago to say brilliant stupid things... but now Liam words are (most of the time) just stupid or frustrated words... this man seems unhappy and angry (to go solo?)\nLiam 2 songs in music videos just do not convinced me musically\nNoel is just another beast... he deserve all my attention... this trailer sound a little bit like psychedelic dance rock... sound really really promising & ambitious
Sounds like a Fifa song
First 30 seconds sounds like U2 'Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me' intro, live version
Pretty bad compared to the other albums hope the rest of the song are golden
potato is on heavy drugs apparently
stop wtih psichidelic, come back to rockanroll, u re not made 4 this bro, it sounds disco pop
Stoked as hell, just don't make it too long man
is that it Noel! liam is fkn   on a different planet u stay on the moon😡
I only pressed the like button to spite Liam.
sounds like something to take acid to
Who Built the Moon? Peter Hook, by the sound of it.
As you were potato x
Think it sounds really promising, glad he is finally pushing the boundaries a little!
it's gonna be something!
If I need an Alarm clock, I'll buy me one. Super annoying that noise in the background. Not for me, thank you!
Yeah, I liked Noel's first two albums and I love Oasis, but I'm not digging this. It's probably just clips of different songs, but I'm not digging this so far, I'm enjoying Liam's new stuff more.
God forbid an artist tries to explore something new, or do you want that same old song again and again every single time.
Fucking class. Fresh air. I couldn't bare another Lock All the Doors, You know We Can't Go Back, type album.. Love both of his first 2, but glad he's changing it up. This is gonna come with harsh criticism, people fear change, but people would criticise him for being too repetitive if he stuck to the same old formula. What I hear here is Noel Gallagher. Liam can stick to singing songs written FOR him in the style of Oasis; Noel is moving on up!¡ He's worked on this for some time and grafted for it so fuck anyone who says that he's bringing it out like a month after Liam to take the spotlight away. Write better fucking songs then if it's that easy to take the spotlight away with an album you claim to be shit after hearing 2 minutes, 30 seconds preview.
I WILL BE UPLOADING THE LYRICS OF THE COMPLETE ALBUM - SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL AND DO NOT LOSE IT
Great to see Noel is developing new styles and continuing to push the boundaries. I'm sure there will still be some classic Noel masterpieces on there too! Can't wait!!!
This is a result of what happens when you hang out with Bono for too long.. FFS ..
m.o.r. pap, sad
Shite
Biblical?
Can I downlaod now?
Psychedelic as fuck! Pink Floyd influence?
Esa tipografía como de Bob Esponja tho
This sounds wrong.
EVERYBODY JUST FUCKING CALM DOWN
Fookin shite. Who built these tunes???
GENIAAAAAAAAAAL !!!!!! \nGREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤👏
Dublin may 2018...see ya there!!!
Fucking amazing 😍😍
Sounds like trippy Madchester
Think you need Liam Noel!!
Definitely Mediocre.
HOOOLLLYYYY FOOK IT TURNIN INTO COLDPLAY!!!!
Sounding a bit like U2😬
love you
Prefiro o Liam,o noel é pop ágora💩
Pinche Liam ni las manos va a meter !!! Qué culo Noel te hubieras esperado 6 meses mínimo
Quien destruyó el rock and roll?
Beautiful video, not really the best song tho.
Who built the moon? Sort of fucking title is that? Sell out anyway
Finally the Noel album we've been waiting for!
Any cunt who thinks bono is cool, is a total cunt.    Noel had lost his soul to all the BS fame and chums.
Hey, I’m an aspiring musician and songwriter, massively influenced by the Gallaghers, Beatles and the like. Please have a listen to some of my originals and let me know what you think!!
I've been waiting my entire adult life for Noel to make this album.  But for the love of god what is that alarm clock doing on there.
Well, well, that came out of nowhere.
Looking forward to listening to this album and as well Liams new album two of my favourites
Took me a couple of listens but I really enjoy this. Very different
Reminds me a bit of some Tame impala stuff, kind of psychedelic or like the last oasis album
Does anyone want to open a whatsapp group about Noel?
Psychedelic Beatles vibe, can't wait for it!
Gets better and better with each listen. Gonna be great live.
Looks like Noel dug out his soul...
This will be Noel's best solo album so far.
Sounds like Noel Gallagher's recorded a Goldfrapp album
it's like he ate Chris Coldplay and then spewed this stuff out\n\nI still wish it would come out sooner... say around 6. October :D I hate waiting
Hmmm I wonder who gets the first pressing... sounds Kasaoasisish with a technical dash !!
Noel's been listening to WAY too much Bon Iver. Or figures that's what he needs to do now days to sell records.
Hey, you inspired me to make a song about cabbage, I've uploaded it to my channel & I'd love to hear what you think about it :)
Well well well Mr Gallagher you've finally gone all Coldplay, good album title tho up there with who invented the skip!!
It is obvious that Hagoromo did.
ok, it's Sgt. Pepper territory now  I see
The average noel fan will find this challenging, what with being a bunch of generic simpletons.
As you fucking were Noel! who cares about OASIS when we're blessed by both Liam and Noel music.
As You Were Noel
Wow this sounds a bit different for Noel but I like it.
Must be in competition with Liam's new album, sibling rivalry at its absolute best.
Sound like Noel`s taking a wee trip back with his Chemical Brothers days. At least he`ll experiencing more than his amateur brother`s basic beginner's Oasis tribute sound.\n\nLiam\nis\ngetting\nhigh\ntonight
Dude this sounds fucking amazing.
:)
Shite
interesting
Visuals remind me of beta band😉😉
SOUNDS EPIC NG :)
https://youtu.be/OJTS2kyMmd8 i hope enjoy
Niiiccceee, Gallaghers been tripping x
Sounds shit
SHADOW PICO!!
Crazy i love
Cada vez se parece mas a la basura de U2...
You've to get your music together  LGs stuff pissing over it atm .
This ain't the Noel I know and remember the fuck is this shite
ha ha ha what a load of shite bet Liam is missing himself knowing he has out muscled his beige brother
I thought he was supposed to be the song writer and brains!?!?! What happened? Non-Biblical on  epic proportions!! As you were!!
wtf is this shite 🤣
pure shit
Fuckenell this is some Coldplay shit at best the mans sold his soul to the devil
It is great to understand what happens in the background & who is working (which roles) in order to get a podcast. Thanks!
Hey Estee, I’m a 27 YO guy (probably not your usual demographic) and I randomly discovered one of your vlogs maybe 5 years ago during a break up. It was a rough patch for me, it really sucked. Your videos helped and they were a great distraction. When the pain of the break up finally passed, the love of your videos remained! You, Aslan and Reggie became a part of my morning routine. I feel like I’ve seen you and your channels grow, and I’ve grown up with you too. I’ve travelled so much the last few years and I think your travelling videos are to thank for it, keeping me motivated to see as much of the world as I can. I even introduced my new girlfriend to your videos and we watch them together as often as you upload haha! I’ve just listened to your first podcast and I love this new direction. I wish you all the best and good luck. Anyway, just wanted to pass on some love!
YES GIRL! x
I was smiling so hard watching this!! So nice to see how it's like behind the scenes :D wishing you lots of success! Excited for the Mum episode!
I've listened to 'Protests' and 'Tattoos' and I loved them both so much!
The recording room definitely makes a difference!! Totally heard the quality change once you walked into the room and at the outro. I’ve never been a big podcast listener but I listen to a lot of NPR so I feel like I’m properly prepped to delve into yours! 💕
Hey Estee, I love your podcasts and your more serious side! Don't get me wrong, makeup and beauty are awesome but it's great to know there's so much more to you. And the podcasts are really well produced as well (shoutout to the team), I SO look forward to hearing more! Subscribed already, keep it up!

Thank you for using your platform in a meaningful way, Estee! It's been incredible to watch you evolve from makeup tutorial and clothing haul videos to this beautiful podcast!  Although I still love your beauty/style content, I LOVE the political/social videos you do witih Aslan, as well as this podcast!  Congrats!!
This makes me so proud of you. Watching you over the years has been nothing but rewarding. I'm super interested in media and radio and this video gave me so much career inspiration. Love you!!
Hi ! Just listened to the first podcast and really enjoyed it ! I have to say Estee i liked your personnality from the day i discovered your channel but you definitely found your thing i mean beauty is great but this (and the talks with Aslan) is so inspirational i am amazed you are a rock'n roll girl just like your mom ;)
The team looks amazing and you've definitely done really good job with the first two episodes. I really enjoyed listening to the podcast, both topics were interesting and the guests are really remarkable people. I really like the new things that you try and that you are not afraid to make changes and do what you enjoy. Good luck!
I am super excited for this! x
Just finished listening to 'Protests' and I LOVED IT!

I love how freaken positive Estée is! I'm so excited for her! Can not wait for this new journey 💙💙💙
I'm so excited!!! I loved the pilot. And just got my first tattoo yesterday. So I'm excited to hear it!
The pilot was so wonderful, can't wait for all of the other episodes! Well done!
I'm so excited about this Estée!! Could you perhaps also do a video on your favorite podcasts? I need some new ones (besides yours)! :)
Such a well put together, interesting podcast! Can't wait for more!
I can't wait!!!!!! I love everything Estee does.\nAlso: please, please, please could you just quickly tell the camera that was used to shoot this? Thank you!!
Protests made me tear up, can't wait to listen to tattoos.\ni just love the direction you're taking Estee, as an older subscriber (i'm 30) this is so satisfying and enriching !
I really enjoyed your preview episode. And this video was super fun and informative. Can't wait to hear more from you (and your Mum, too!).
This is huuuuuge! So happy for you! But also, soooo many questions: Could you talk a little bit more about your role in the podcast besides narrating? About the process of creating an episode: who is the mastermind behind each topic? How is the direction decided? Who writes the script? How did the idea of making a podcast come to be: were you approached by Radio Wolfgang? Did you approach them? How did the original idea evolve to what it has become? So cool!!
That Ghost World reference
I can't help staring at your tight top ;p. Interesting video!
i finished Protest and I loved it. sooo lovely seeing bts of your podcasts!
Hmm I downloaded Wolfgang to listen to your podcast and it didn't seem to work!!  Is anyone else having issues finding it on android?
I didn't quite understand what your podcasts are going to be about?.. Good luck anyways
Whoopi looks good
Veterans have fought among other things, so people can peacefully protest, so stop using them as an excuse for your bigotry and ignorance, most of them are happy to witness their purpose. #vetsforequality
That blonde lady wants some of 50 for sure..that body language and flushed face 😷😷😷😷
don't look in 50s eyes, he'll charm you
anyone know what the 50 song playing in the beginning is?
What's the name of that 50 cent song playin at the beginning?
Awe! I want a hug!
This was a great segment with 50 and the ladies!
...if I was the president by accident...\n\nSee, I'll ALWAYS believe Trump wasn't serious when he ran and he didn't think he'd get voted in (by electoral college).\n\nRepublicans f*cked up big time.
✨ 50 CENT FOR PRESIDENT! 🇺🇸💫
Trump is Not anything by accident, he's a DEPLOYABLE by chose he was put in the WH with Vladimer Putin help NOT by accident ! Putin knew what he was doing and so did TRUMP! He was grinning from ear to hear all the time, he knew he didn't have a chance, toward the end you could see when he changed I guess he got word his buddy was going to help. He really started bullying folks in the public square, lying about Hilary Clinton, ripping her hard worked, hard earned lifetime reputation to bits with Putin's help! I hope it's provened what he's done with Putin's help and he's chased off the face of this Earth! Putin will continue to be Putin but there should NOT be room for Vladimer Putin or his partner in CRIME DONALD JUNE TRUMP in The USA!
I wonder how the ladies would react to this man, if they had him on their show:  https://youtu.be/4i-6u_ZCKSY
I swear 50 ain't no fly guy.  But when he puts on clothes------
If you ask someone what their opinion in on a subject let them answer before pushing your own pathetic narrative lady. You're clearly one of those people who aren't accepting of other peoples view points.
50 just naturally smells good...bet that hug felt GOOD!
what's the song playing when he's coming out?
What was the name of the Cologne 50 was wearing???
Anyone know the name of this song?
shame on the women of the view. he is a misogynist, ignorant bully. how could u have him on your show? he repeatedly disrespects women.
What song played when he came out?
they all got moist from that hug... except for whoopi
Hi F!
gross
**Curtis RATSON!!!**
Anyone know the name of the intro strong for 50?
It's Fiddy!
did you catch the shade from Whoopi,..........you hear that ABC
why are you and other MSM outlets NOT reporting on this      https://youtu.be/FEbtrlYQuzk
why did   the fat  one  wearing  the  blue   assume  he has  couple  of kids he  only  has  1
Whoopi 'it's not rape rape' goldburg
If Trump is so sensitive about the Flag:\n\n--Why does Trump not show his tax returns of he is so devoted to the flag and America?  I mean he loves the flag and the country that deeply,  why not be open with the American public like all former Presidents did.\n\n--Why did Trump insult so many people under the American Flag, including veterans? \n\n--Why are so many in the Trump cabinet associated with Russia, if he loves the Flag and the country that much?\n\n--Why did Trump defend the KKK and neo-Nazi who he called  very fine people, while  they killed a woman and attacked clergies, the folks who defended the confederacy (traitors to America) and the confederacy flag (a flag appose to the American flag)? Yet, at the same time he was outraged about Anti Fascists (abolitionists). And he doubled down on them!\n\n--Why is Trump so concerned with a entertainment game?  And not with the 900.000 false arrested black lives that were made between 2007 and 2015 by NYPD? Or the 50% of exonerated black lives, because of false incarceration? Or the almost 90% of clearances of black lives in FBI stats? \n\nAll this happens under the American Flag. \n\n--Why is he not as concerned with the 3 million Americans at Puerto Rico who are without water and electricity, but instead spends his weekend tweeting about athletes who exercise their right???
Come on, Sunny!  What was the point of your question about Power, other than spoiling a major plot point from the finale?  That was a really dumb question that was super unnecessary.  I understand that the season ended a couple weeks ago, but there is a way to ask a question like that without naming the character or at least ask something interesting like how will that impact the characters and have you already starting working on the scripts for next season instead of asking if your going to bring the character back from the dead.  You're smarter than that girl!
these sports stars are black billionaires in a ''white racist country'' lolol the teams are from Liberia surely\nwe all have slaves - i have 14 slaves they live in india and china they pick tea and coffee and spices :( \nhttp://slaveryfootprint.org/survey/#where_do_you_live\nwhoopi as a rich american how many slaves do you have - maybe i will do a survey for you - i reckon you would have about 150 slaves working for you WITHOUT you knowing or caring
does anyone think that 50 looks like Matt Damon?
50 cent would make a good/better President....
I'm the 1 these b!tches wantI be keeping the dough Coming in coming in coming inI'm on to something!!!
where were y'all when Obama signed the ndaa
Does anybody know what kind of training watch Sarah has on?
What song is at the beginning?
HEY WHOOPI I HEARD A GREAT MINISTER FROM MOBILE ALABAMA CALL HIM #45...THAT WAY WE ALL CAN CALL HIM HOW WE FEEL ABOUT HIM ..AFTER 45 COMES 46👊👊👊
What's the intro song called
50 cent still looks the same after these years
50 cent was one of all time best rappers. from the 00s. one of my favorites.
Blondie wants that BBC.  Peep the body language 👀 🍫 🍆 her panties filled with lust 💦💦 #forbiddenfruit
We want JED BACK!
the king
That's zaddy
Lol. Dumb.
This got me thinking: Are there things that I don’t like about America? Yes. Quite a few, in fact. Violence against the unborn, the highest violent crime rate in the industrialized world, sordid social agendas, the destruction of the family, high taxes and a creeping socialism are all high on my list. With these things in mind, perhaps I should take a knee, too? Maybe you have your own list of things you don’t like about America. Shall we all kneel and stick it to the man, as they say?No.The national anthem is about unity, not division. Think on the words. They tell of a perilous night through which a battle raged. Our nation was on the brink of extinction. When dawn finally came, the sun shone brightly on our tattered flag, giving proof to the fact that we had, indeed, survived as a nation. The story appeals to our better selves by reminding us that we are a people who unite and persevere through troubled times.By contrast, not only does Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem do nothing to advance the cause he advocates, it further divides an already deeply divided nation by unnecessarily offending and alienating people who are in no way guilty of the offenses he decries.
what was the song he came out to
does any know what song he walked out too
Name of the song at the beginin'
What's name of song he walk out on
You are more likely to be killed by aspirin then cops. Just saying. What a waste of energy
U Made It My Man......LOL
Addicted to POWER!! what a fucking good serie!! Well done!!
Sunny says you smell really good! Hahaha
6:50 SPOILER WARNING!
I love 50. xoxo
Where's Ja?
No doubt.
Niggas
Making those forehead gains
He didn't really say anything poignant abt the kneeling🙄 what a waste of a platform😒
what a miserable bunch of cunts
50 and diddy aspire to be like trump but because these networks hate trump they have to go along with it.
I got here from watching NFL anthem protesters . Fuk these feminist hos especial the racist red head .
That black guy is dumber than a box of rocks...50 cent isnt very bright either.
So we're just gonna ignore the fact that 50 has publicly denouced his other son?
this show has rea ched the ultimate in boredom and one dimension
50 cent has definitely lost his street cred!  Can't believe he's on this show with these moaning, whiny hags.
This is such a stupid protest i swear to God what is wrong with you people?
The bum. in chief,  sounds great,lol
Well here is a Great Look at FEMINISM, all of these rich women that hate and cant keep a man.
The view sucks. So do it's followers. You're all retards.
he worried about peaceful protest, celebrity apprentice is real without camera
Get rid of 50 cent! It's only 50 cents!
So now the view has only one view....they call the President a bum....but we couldn't even mention anything about Obama.....that would have been racist, but when a black woman says things like Wooppie does it OK and not racist.....really ?
50 shouldn't be talking bout father hood when he not a father to his oldest
Did you know there are 1.8 billion Muslims in the world! Now that's a lot of pubey beards and crusty sandals!
you mean he is reproducing!   God help us!
I think we should get rid of poopie Goldberg and 0 cents.
Ask an ape a serious question, and you get an ape level answer.
Just goes to show you, you can be a billionaire and a president and YET still be a big fat BUM!
lol 50 fifty tweets and says the same dumb things as the president. so...not sure why everyone is clapping for him.
This guy can't talk without smiling.
Fuk you View ,i was in the Vietnam war and lost 2 Brothers, to the war , so leave the FLAG LONE
WAYMENT, did he just say, President by acciden? LOL! KMSL! That was so funny! THANKS FIDDY! I needed that!
One ugly dude. Close your mouth
Thought he went broke!
50 cent I'd duuuuuummmmmbbbbbb!
What an absolute wanker
50 aint got no eyebrows
The players that take a knee shouldn't be played - the NFL ratings have gone down - over 700 black people were killed last year by other black people however only 16 unarmed black people were killed by cops
Jed is way to good for these poor excuses for women. Angry and so unkind.
50 Cent has shot people before but never killed anyone. He was one of the biggest drug King Pins in Queens, NY at the age of 19 and had the whole hood where he’s from working for him.  And this is who black people look up to for 'fatherhood'.
Having Respect in this country is so important. This is so disrespectful to the families that had their father's and mothers killed in the line of duty. If you do not like American. You have options to leave. If you ever traveled to another country. We are so blessed to have what we have. Spend time in another country and look around and see. Thank you for reading!
A little troubling that his son colored 50 with white skin :/
what does this guy do anyway?
I'm a bit disappointed, he seemed bashful and out of place. I wanted to hear more from him. I wanted to hear him speak on serious issues, to know how intellectual he is...or isn't. I already know of his degree in pettiness and attacking trolls and other celebs on social media. Intellect is very attractive, not looks and smell good alone.
The first part of the video is soooo amazing !! Makes me feel life is so beautiful 😍
4:31 When someone you hate is walking up to you

Am I just seeing things, or are they both getting a bit more muscular, ripped, defined, proportional, and symmetrical etc.???  💪
Top finish. Love the dive from the keeper!
Arsene Wenger reportedly interested in signing him
A beastly finish from Payet's big brother
The keeper trying to save it made it even more special for him. Look how emotional he gets It's like he's just won the world cup! I bet the keeper is so pissed for conceding a goal 😂😂😂
Love how the keeper still tried for it
Arsenal wenger:I almost signed him
Better than Benzema
What a fucking finish lad!
Well down you man this is real fan :)
Not all heroes wear capes
What a finish bottom corner😂
How is this on the trending page and there's only 9 comments??
Candidate for puskas award.
We've all thought about it..
The man is living the dream, what a legend
Hulk has let himself go
Nigga really made the most out of this moment
on his way to liverpool
Puskas award winner
Lol only the keeper tried
Wasn't that an own goal?
My friend:if you go and score I will give you a pie\n\nMe: hold my beer
That's one off the bucket list 😝
I don't think the goal Keeper was ready for it...
Yellow card for the celebration hahaa
Keeper is horrible
Quality finish hahaha
Why is this trending
What a goal 😂😂😂
Lol
Go on lad !
Bless his little heart

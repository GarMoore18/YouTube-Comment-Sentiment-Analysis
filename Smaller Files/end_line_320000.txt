Issac and Ayla reminds me of us when we were younger haha!
I was waiting in the lunch line, sliding my tray along the metal rails. I look to my left and all I see is Michael Jackson in the Beat It outfit. He asks me to pass him the red jello and when I turn back to hand it to him he isn’t there but instead doing the moon walk on the center table. Weirdest thing...the lunch room was completely empty.
She's getting the Michelin rolls like Isaac did!!! So precious!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Congratulations on partnering with the Gates Foundation! Such an amazing opportunity!
Issac and Ayla are so cute near the end of the vid,\nAnd God Bless for passing on the gift of education & for building schools also how neat that bill gates foundation took part too
Honestly you are one of the reason why I started vlogging and my channel because you are my inspiration like how bill gates are yours . Your vlogs never fails to make me smile and I always look forward for your vlogs . I’ve been a fan of yours really really long and I admire you a lot . :)
I just want to share ur positivity and cute children! The vlogz always bring me joy!
Issac is growing up so fast!! 💕
I have very unusual dreams like breathing underwater, jumping off huge metal platforms, naked Mario kart, yAa I have lots more
Ayla is really oh so cute .. hope to bump into u n ur lovely family in hk :) best meantime
can I ask how you do the globe thing. thanks
I got teary eyed about the Bill and Melinda partnership. It warms my heart so much to see all this amazing goodness happening. Glad to be apart/a witness to it all💜
I'm going to admit I started crying when I saw Isaac run to Lindy when he saw her and he started talking about the airplane ❤❤❤
Your hair looks like one side is short and the other is long when you were talking about the schools
what's beautiful about education: no one could take it away from you!!
Lindy your breast milk is the best moisturizer she can ever have on her face. Please hug Isaac for me and kisses for Lala too💋💋💋
U back to hk!!!!
I MADE THE MISTAKE OF WATCHING THIS IN PUBLIC AND I’M TRYING NOT TO SOB issac and ayla are going to be the cutest siblings he loves taking care of her it’s so precious
bubz, it's bad to leave a baby in the tub/bath for so long (or taking your time)!~ the rule is to always give the quickest shower possible, dry them up real quick and put on clothes ^-^
What's the song that u used at the airport?
How chunky can a baby be? :DD omg!
I love you bubs!!!! I know it's not easy but please please vlog more about isaac💖💖💖💖
YES SHE IS STRONG AND CUTE!   \nJUST GOT MY FIRST BABY AND NOW I AM NOT A SUGAR DADDY ANYMORE. JUST A DADDY. (KIDDING) I AM GOING TO CHANGE MY KIDS CHANNEL IN TO A VLOG CHANNEL SO PLEASE TELL ME IF THIS IS A GOOD IDEA! HERE IS A TEASER OF MY FIRST VLOG EVER. I EVEN PAID YOU TUBE TO SHOW IT BECAUSE MY VIDEOS ARE GETTING LOST UNDER ALL THIS CONTENT. https://youtu.be/wmF27yms80A?sub_confirmation=1
Ayla is so precious 😭 I remember watching your vlogs when Isaac was first born & look how far you've come!!! Your little family keeps growing & it's so pure to see the love. You've taught me so much in the YEARS I've watched you & im so happy for you bubz! ❤️
where is the baby bath from?
Sounds like the best dream ever
Why do they travel to Hong Kong so often!! Just wonderinggg, love YA BUBZ
Now I want some pinapple bread. Too bad I'm in the middle of Missouri :, (
omg the moment when Isaac ran to you 😍😍
What is her name what bubs refers to? 😭😭
May i know what is the music at 4:17? Thank you:)
Bubz you inspired me to chase my dreams/take risks and it just so happens that involved moving to hong kong. Will you do a meet up anytime soon in hkg?
How long are you guys going to be in Hong Kong? My husband and I will be visiting Hong Kong for the first time in early November and we are so excited! Will be so awesome if i run into you guys:D chance will be very tiny, but I pray and hope that we do get to meet! Love you and your kids!
Not the weirdest but definitely a weird dream was last week I dreamt that I was in Northern Ireland (I live in London) and got lost so you, Tim and a female offered to take me dinner and show me around. We went dinner together but I told you I had to be home by 10pm (it was 7pm when we had dinner)\nI woke up wondering: \n1. Can I get home to London from NI in 3 hours? It's already 40mins drive from Heathrow to home!\n2. Why am I seeing u in my dream? \n3. I've had déjà vu, had dreamt of an incident that happen later on as if I have sixth sense (this happened once). So what do you call this? I dreamt that I was with u, in ur home town and now I'm watching a video of u asking what's ur viewers' weirdest dream?! Weird huh.
I keep forgetting she's only two months. She's so big
BACK IN THE OLD APARTMENT YAYAYA
So proud of Isaac, he loves his sister I'm so jealous because my brother is a prick to me :'( thank you Lindy for making videos 💕
Welcome back to Hong Kong 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Anyone else notice the low-key sexual remark bubz made?! It's okay that you don't have fingers!!! 😂😂😂 I know exactly why you said that in your dream 😏😂
Almost a million subscriber's!!
How lindy and tim has taught isaac to be such a nice kid .. i wish i could do the same with my kid in future.. i love them soo much.. *hugs* all the way from India ❤
that little mini reunion with u and isaac at the airport was so adorable i had to replay it a few times
YOUR DREAMMM AHHAHAHA I get very crazy dreams too! Almost every night 😂
Please feel free to visit my channel ❤❤❤\nSub to sub,comment if your done 😁😁😁
Isaac is such a helpful big brother! 8:41, Ayla's face is like, Did I tell you to stop? LOL
OMG ISAAC'S BO LOR BAO WAS THE CUTEST!!!!
4:54 literally made my day ❤
I wish I was a baby again 😭 I miss it when my mom took care of me like this
Why is she putting Crisco on the baby.
Everytime I see your vlogs and see Ayla I can't help but want to hug her >~< she's cute like her brother
Bubz!!!! You need a new intro! :) ❤
Your little family just makes my life in college more bearable for me to go through
Always so excited when you post a new vlog! So happy you all made it safely to Hong Kong <3
You should really use a mask if you don't want to get your babies sick... young children's immune system are still developing so it's easier for them to get sick.\nTransferring cold is as easy as just talking to your child face to face.
+Bubzvlogz, are you going to film a new intro to your videos now with Ayla?
i keep replaying that part isaac runs to bubz ❤️ SO CUTE IM SOFT
You need a new opening for your vlogs! :O
I think it's time we change the intro again! hahaha
What time is it where you live?? It’s 6:24 p.m for me 😊😊😊 love you bubzfamily
I need to catch up on her vlogs...;;
AHHHHH THE THUMB NAIL IS IN HONG KONG

TATS AMAZING BUBZ!!! EDUCATION IS LIFE
Bubz, your vlogs make me so happy. Thanks for sharing such wondrous journies.
Your babies are sooo cute & healthy!
issac looks so much more mature now
佢講波蘿包好清楚喎⋯⋯
Are her cheeks like soft squishy mochi? :D
Issac and Ayla are so precious!
The cutest little summo wrestler ever
Am I the only one who noticed that Isaac is getting chubbier ?
Issac is such a good older brother!!! <3
Oh yay, I was wondering about Ghana. I'm so excited for that!\nEdit: Also, Ayla is the cutest little baby. Her cheeks do look so soft!
I'm so happy and proud to see one of my favorite youtubers giving back and taking philanthropy and activism seriously! Your commitment to education is inspiring
Hello everyone, i just want to let you guys know that i just had roasted chicken for dinner.
Oh my god Bubz with her cute little voice saying Do you want me to kick his ass? made me laugh so hard lol
We need to protect Chance at all costs. \nLove you Daniel you're precious too.
I'd call this song Dreamin' About Stars
The first verse and second verse when he talks about what he had to give up to make it just makes me want to make it that much more its like a bittersweet pain, not being with his daughter , not being able to play with his cousins, etc. then he flips it and says he finally made it and we good ... we aint gotta work no more mama
They wanna take flick I wanna flip a table. My God I feel you big bro!
listen till the end guysnits worth it¡!!!!
Hubby said using up to much data playing this track. But damn if I ain't bout to switch to unlimited. Just makes me throw my hands up and scream YASSSSSS!
The time is now to accept Jesus into your lives if you haven't done so already. Brothers & Sisters, let's fight the good fight against sin until we're called !
Does anyone know what song they sampled?!
Can someone please tell me the name of this song
Chance’s upper body be getting real lit while he sitting in that stool 😂😂
Fucking Beauty. Chano always knows how to kill it.
That no better blues flow🔥
Saying I loooooooooove you...........\n\nOh wait.... wrong intro. My bad.\n\n(P.s. this song blew me away.)
I'm responsible for half the views, and that's me being modest.
this is pure magic.
u know as soon as i saw daniel caesar i clicked
Its much harder to sin naked\nI walked past apple trees and didn’t take it! BRUH! MIND BLOWN!
WOW the CDQ version is going to be amazing. Damn this dude is the most soulful dude since 04 Ye.
You always feel good music. It hits you and that brought a tear in the end...the lighting too...shhhhhhhesh
Such a chill song
Lol now I see why Joe roasted him so bad.
Ya'll don't understand... me and Daniel got this thing going on.... lol. Love it.
This song needs to be released ASAP! Idk where, just as long as it’s accessible!
“The day is on its way it couldn’t wait no more here it comes ready or not”. Pay attention to what he means
Someone please do a tab of this
The way the song ends makes me feel like I'm in church
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😭💗😭Oh my gosh I'm at a lost for words 😭💗, I love chance the Rapper and Daniel Ceaser I even made a video on my YouTube channel to one of Chance's original poems that he performed at NPR
Good song but I feel like I woulda liked it more if Chance left most of the singing to Daniel. His voice is great and should’ve been used more but that’s just me.
What an incredible performance. Chance, especially accompanied by an amazing group of musicians, brings emotion that can move almost any audience. Thank you for sharing your music with us.
Stay strong chance, you can beat them ! <3
This is going to be one of those songs where people comment still listening in 2025
David Brooks' article in the New York Times brought me here
He's dope but if you think he can sing, your stupid lol
BORING!!! This is coming from someone who loves both these artist too
word play in this is incredible.
Daniel Cesar 😍
My dreams finally came true 🔥
Joe Budden is trippin
This some poetry slam shit.. fuken trash lmao
So good!
Lit
Imma pee my pants my 2 fav artist😫❤️
Killed it bro
Goosebumps....
Fuck Joe Budden
This too fye
WHEN
he is 2 talented reppin chicago
bruh.... too much too handle
i love this
Chance the Clap Backer
Dude, fuck Joe Budden. This joint is 🔥!
2/3 of Third story tho 👏🏾
Real nice chance
Big ego hiding behind humility.
Joe budden got me here
Amazing!
That last verse though, into the drive!!! powerful
fuck . this is HOT .
I let Satan listen to this and he became jesus
Some people are worried about Chance's direction because of this song.  Dude wrote the song in 2 days after a record label still wouldn't let him perform Grown Ass Kid.  Naturally, he's going to go where he's comfortable - spoken word.  I guarantee Daniel Ceasar had that melody already created and played it for Chance.  This song is poignant, honest, and relevant.  I applaud the man, we're going to see a whole other side of him on the next record, but he's always going to be at his best in the spoken word format.
My man Daniel is getting the recognition he deserves. His time is coming soon...
I believe in god after listening to him....\ngoosebumps
Soulful as always. I hope his next album will be as good as the Acid Rap
Why is he amazing
Listen to STATEMENT (FULL SONG) by XL Hope #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-508343119/statement-1
FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO DIDNT LIKE THE SONG\nY'all need to understand that the shit now is trash all rappers sound the same they some fake ass singers. rap shouldn't just be  about getting money ,having sex , drinking, gun violence. This song was amazing it spoke the truth this is spoken words/ rap it was amazing I just wish people would try to understand that. Listen to the message.
Joe Budden needs to sit down and listen to this again.
Chance is so appreciative towards The Social Experiment. He always makes sure they get their well deserved share of the applause after every performance. It's fucking awesome to see.
i keep coming back to this video.. too good
It's much harder to sin naked\nI walked past apple trees and didn't take it\nThat Adam and Eve reference tho 🔥
I keep on watching this video non stop
This is perfect
three verses. hell yes.
:,-)
ideal beauty through art
Almost sounds like Mac DeMarco!
Soulful... much love 🔥🙏🏽
This shit had me AWAKENED!
Beautiful
spitin fire
lil too sleepy for me chano
No more ,No more.
Cried a lot
yes WTF ABSOLUTELY THIS COLLAB I JUST DIED
love it when chance sings honest and daniel caesar just so beautiful
who else wants chance the rapper or daniel ceaser to make a praise and worship song 😍
Russel Westbrook -   I'll Be Champion Soon \nhttps://youtu.be/7HjB3xPjN60\nRussell Westbrook -  I'll Be Champion Soon
“ITS MESSED UP I MADE IT THIS WAY AND MY FEET SO SORE, BUT ITS ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE, I CAN TEACH SNOWBOARDS” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
C'mon Chance - now when are you going to put this on iTunes so that I don't have to loop this on YT...🙌
It's amazing too hear him progress as a person through his music
The metaphors, biblical references, punch lines, and word choices are incredible. His pen game is next level.
Doesn't even have a title still FUCKING AWESOME SONG!!!👌
I can already tell that chance is gonna help him blow up❤️ thank you chance once again
Damn this is beautiful 🔥🔥🔥
DANIEL CAESAR!!! THIRDSTORY!!! love from toronto <3
As one of my favorite rappers, I just wanna say, this shit sucks!
Pure bullshit. How anyone can call this singing is beyond me. It's muttering. The guitar was boring as well. Millennials love to give themselves too much credit over utter CRAP.
Acid rap he sounded kind of atheist.. Can't boo god lol
Yes this is rap that I want to hear more of! Change the game Chance!
No I won't
I love Taylor Swift and katy Perry 😍🎼moreover a swiftie😍

OMG A YOUTUBE RED MOVIE! <3 but the money T^T
Finally people will realise that she didn't go insane or turned into Miley Cyrus. She was and still is a normal person, her hair didn't take her sanity away neither her voice.
I cant wait for that😀
What's the song on the end? Plzz
I don't want to look like Katy Perry anymore\nThat broke my heart\nBut if she's a human being and she deserves everything she believes. I love you, dont care what critics say I will  buy your CDs even in 2070
Katy is a legend
Is math related to science?
Witness is the 2nd best song ive ever heard, 1st one is Firework
I just saw her in DC this week and it was amazeballs and can't wait for this to come out!!!

Loving the trailer of Gaga five foot two
i always wondered did she go to the bathroom in that livestream
So stupid
Stupid
CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\n\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\n\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\n\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\n\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\n\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \n\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John
I like you John, but the just believing US intelligence services just because they say something? No, thank you.
The DNC was NOT hacked it was an inside job. https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/
This is not a Topic I think vlogbrothers should not be touching.
John, here's a good article about collusion in case you haven't read it. \nhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/12/what-is-collusion-215366
you broke the 4 min rule
i supported trump in the general election- i'm glad you made this video, i've done the research myself. i think it's important that people know these things. i do happen to thing the collusion narrative is a nothing-burger, but like you said, we don't know for sure as of now.
Hey John can you make a video explaining the content of the Wikileaks emails, exposing Hillary Clinton and the DNC.
Can't wait for Trump to win in 2020.
Ok... when will you do a video on wire tapping?
This video gave me cancer. Great bias
Vlogbrothers, you forgot to mention what the leaks were... Can you shed some light on the specific leaks so that we can all be more educated on the subject?
The only point Hilary stood for that. Isn't like was how strict her idea was on weapon owning.
Great video John, thanks for calling it down the middle and using strictly facts
Hey John Trump out clintoned the clintons. lets move on
If there was strong suspicion of the  DNC emails being hacked why didn't the FBI investigate  those emails?  On a side note, has any information leaked about these hacked emails been called untrue?
So dumb. Russia wasn't trying to sway it toward Trump. They just wanted to sow discord and diminish confidence in our elections.
The whole Drumpffanzee Junta and fambly should be liquidated!
Still doesn't deny hillary is a crook. Or he had foreign funds from foundations.
At least he seems more or less unbiased.  A rare thing these days.
I've been waiting for this video for a while now. Thank you for doing this. It makes all of this a lot clearer for me. \nNo that note: Now I know that (Barring WWIII and the world ending) it's going to take much longer to impeach Trump (Who is probably psychologically unstable) than I thought.
As an ex nerdfighter and libertarian, I think this is very well done and pretty fair, but I would add 2 points to the conversion. \n\n1) While I despise Trumps inability to recognize he's the POTUS and with that his opinions/desires carry more weight, I believe that much like saying NFL players should be fired, him asking Comey to drop the case is exactly that, him, as a person, asking. I realize he can't do that and agree that he can't do that, but I don't think his motives are the same level of malice. Claiming he fired Comey to stop an investigation is asinine, firing a director doesn't mean the whole organizations direction changes. \n\n2) I hate when Trump does it just like I hated it when Obama did it. Look it up, Obama asked Putin for political grace until after his 2012 election, basically changing foreign policy just to get re-elected. It is whataboutism, but it's important to realize it's more the office than the individual. \n\nAlso, I could be wrong, but I believe the Russians attempted to hack the GOP servers but republican security was actually decent.
Its very interesting seeing what comes next out of this whole Russian conspiracy.  The more we find out the less compelling the case.  Which begs the question, why did so many people collude to fabricate this?  Was it just their hatred of Trump himself?  Or was it the embarrassing results of the election, and an entire campaign built on lying to their own voter base that Hillary was going to win?
Trump RELEASE your FUCKING Tax Returns, god damn you!!!!
People are acting like Trump took donations from the Russians so they could have uranium. And then bleached his private email server. 😊👌🏽🤣
if i remember right didn't some arab country in the gulf give money to Hillary???
Hillary's into creepy, weird, sick stuff, man.
HA!
But...her emails.😂
John I just want to thank you again, as a conservative, for how unbiased your reports on current events are. It is often quite difficult for me to learn much about what's going on in the world without a STRONG liberal or conservative bias on the telling of the events and sharing of information.
Point 3, we can all agree the DNC and Hillary leaked emails is something that happened and everybody agrees they are REAL. How about we discuss the contents John, something nobody in the mainstream media even considered covering. Why is that John?
We should've known about the wiki leaks anyways... it's hillary's fault she lost, not the Russians lol
So the news source that is the best at citing its sources, effort towards impartiality, and acknowledging limitations is a young adult novelist who sells shirts with his face and reference to pizza on them. Surprised? Neither am I at this point.
Trumps closest advisors and family members engaged in dubious interactions with a foreign power.  He is either a figurehead, who is routinely kept in the dark, or he knew about what was going on.
Likes: 16,005   Dislikes: 2,202\nThat puts the approval rating at 86.25% Could be worse. You could be living in a big white house and having an 11 year old mowing crooked lines all over your lawn.
i really like for you guys to comment on Philippines Scarborough Shoal and china's claim to it.... pretty soon its gonna become buried just the ukraine.
Dear John, I've got a review due for my uni course (Journalism with English language, yay!). I still have some time to write it, but I'm one of those people who like to assess everything in detail and take their time (aka: procrastinator, although I must say in my defense that English is not my first language and I'm doing my entire course in English, so there you go). So I was wondering if you maybe could send me a copy of Turtles All the Way Down so I've got enough time to enjoy it and then submit my review. That would be awesome beyond words.
This is eerily like Season 2 of House of Cards. Remember what happened to Garret Walker?
What about dual citizens (with USA)?
Let's just look at the historic of truthness into american secret agency statements before using as an argument that they've stated it. (a hint : it's not great)\nAnd... Eihter I'm really tired or in the links supposed to prove the hacking of podesta's emails by russia I only see \n- allegations\n- conclusions without proofs or by citing a document that in definitiv only alledges that (the secret agencies statements per exemple)\n- or maybe at best points at weird stuff that would kind of create suspicion in anyone's head. \nNothing like a real PROOF.
I can't believe the Russians worked against the candidate that promised to perpetuate the hyper-interventionist US global foreign policy, threatening their country with all-out war and aiding radical Islam in the process. What an outrage!
Nice. A rational voice on this. Thank you John, that's why we love you.
You looked depressed, almost suicidal. You should look into therapy.
Watching the results of the Mueller investigation is going to be streamed history, lat's all grab some popcorn and shitpost the president, that got shitposted into office, out of office.
#1 fact you leave out: No red blooded American would take voting advice from a Russian. We voted for Trump for many different reasons, but not one was because a Russian told us so.
lol confirmed by two different news sources to state your fact!!.lol
Yeah, but most importantly, did he ever wear a tan suit?????
Yes you're correct in that Trump won, but not the election.\n\n#AbolishTheElectoralCollege
It's good to know (and somewhat surprising) that I have the facts straight, with some new ones as well as some old ones a little bit more clearly laid out.\nThank you, John!!! I know these newsy ones are VERY difficult and probably stressful for you. Stay well!!! DFTBA!
💜
Such a brilliant video which is always the case with Vlogbrothers!  My first encounter was a Scishow video which had a follow up link to John's Honey Badger video. That got me hooked for life!
very impressed with your well rounded and non-biased analysis. Thank you for the synopsis on this topic.
This makes this messy issue much clearer for me. Thanks!!!
Also, Thing of value is intentionally vague because you aren't supposed to be seeking a foreign governments help in our elections. It's meant to cover literally anything and everything. Information against your opponent is always valuable.\n\nThis playing the devil's advocate shit doesn't suit you. Use your intelligence, this is insulting to watch.
This was a great video. I don't have anything to contribute. I'm just commenting so this video gets more comments.
Can you do a video on Trump's proposed tax plan?
Mr. Green, I thank you for explaining this.  I recall you doing something similar when the Ukrainian government was overthrown over three years ago.  I appreciate that you took the time to take this complicated (and very unresolved) issue.
AC on the fritz John?
THE AMERICAN ELECTION IS LIKE A LOTTO. WHO WINS GETS TO SCREW THE PUBLIC IF HE LIKES. HARD TO TELL WHO IS THE GOOD GUY AND WHO THE BAD GUY IS. THE AMERICAN VOTERS PAY THE PRICE ALWAYS
our democracy...\n\nHaha that's funny.
That's a nice vlog there, vlogbrother.\n\n*winkie face*
I with Julian Assange on this one.
Turned your video off at the first falsehood, only took 10 seconds.  DHS stated this week, there is not a single shred of evidence.  There was no collusion with Trump camp and Russia, it simply didn't happen.
Seth Rich who is Seth Rich what happened to him why does WikiLeaks offer a reward for information on him
Leaving out a ton aren't you? Like you're leaving out all the shady crap the democrats did\n\nClinton was even getting money from Russia. Why leave that out? Why leave out favors were going to her (playing both hands isn't uncommon and is safe).\nAlso he kinda really kept out how most people in the cyber security world said none of the evidence shown the DNC was hacked by Russia. The guy's password was password, his IT staff told him that wasn't a real e-mail, and he still went through it. If you actually read their public notes, the security agencies say Russia did it because they put propaganda on RT not dealing with the hack. (Why is it that people forget that these law makers are also not tech savvy by any degree?)\nLastly, he didn't mention basically everyone messes with everyone's elections. Obama even openly admitted he was messing with them overseas.There isn't a single law against 1 country advertising and pushing for who they like. Like as long as gifts aren't given (look at Clinton and she broken this majorly so), and the written laws aren't broken. There is always someone trying to push who they like in office.\n*Oh and did everyone forget that Clinton said she wanted to go to war with Russia? She literally said war brings people together.* And it isn't like it's all that hard to find all the dirt on her. Russia paying $100k to FB which gets literally billions in ads isn't jack. People didn't want her for many reasons. Her only reason to run was it was her time. She wanting to go to war with Russia by controlling the air space over Syria (even Sanders told her that was stupid). He not really pushing for more jobs and acting like no one was financially hurting. The mountains of evidence of her corruption and shady dealings. Her being super unstable emotionally. *Hell, she is still blaming everyone but herself. Do you really want someone like that for the leader of the world?*\n*If she didn't try her corrupt dealings with Sanders then he most likely would've won. He even won the primaries, but the DNC hacks shown she screwed with that. Why isn't she in jail yet?*
Shut up with all this library shit, last I checked this wasn't Adam Ruins Everything
Russia definitely tried to influence the election, but @MkBlyth explains how @realDonaldTrump actually won. https://youtu.be/Fq_NMyKfNoY?t=9s
TRUMP + RUSSIA = NOTHING*\n*just the fact that we found nothing , just proves they are hiding something.
Hope you get paid a lot for this.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
sorry to be a bit off point.  Just read in the NYT of 9/28 that your book Looking for Alaska made the list of most censored books in 2017.  My sincerest congratulations.  You must be doing something very right.
You know its Russian when European
I didnt listen to this video but only to say that for ANYTHING concerning RISSIA - Professor Stephen Cohen is a must.
There was no interference. There is no evidence to prove or even suggest it. Don’t be fooled people
Excellent. Thank you, John.
good unbiased information dump.
Bernie would have won
Get a grip alt-right morons
Russia had no envolvment bud. \nPutin gains NOTHING.
So freaking glad I'm Canadian.
Man stupid Watergate is just taking forever. Any CEO of a major corporation would have had to sit in court already but because it's that orange fool he seems to be immune to anything. Insult women, outrage but nothing is done about it. Insult Mexicans, some outrage but because they're undesirables nothing offs done about it. It's so weird looking in from the outside. Can somebody just call another election already?
Fair video, I enjoy listening to the facts not the propaganda MSM tries to shove down my throat
Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.
You're beating a dead horse, kid.
... And you miss the point where Comey leaked information to the press. Illegal... Sour grapes.
Honestly.. I couldn't follow all of what he said. But what I heard was  insightful.
This is the same type of evidence a child uses to determine if the pretty girl in class knows your name. 8:22\nP.S - She just thinks your a nothing burger
Sigh....I'm dissapointed. \n1) No new information or insight about established information.\n2) All of the Facts you list are questions, they don't provide answers \n3) None of this courtroom Evidence. As frustrating as that is because there is so much unprecedented but circumstantial evidence.\n4) The FBI and many members of Congress agree that Russia......  IS NOT PROOF. Those 2 bodies have extensive histories of law-breaking, perjury and deception.\n5) I was hoping you guys would be SCIENCY and informs us WHY the FBI and members of Congress agree that Russia did it.\nBecause if you ask the PROFESSIONALS in Hacking and Cyber Security, the proof FBI gave that Russia Hacked emails and cyber-attacked voting systems is NO PROOF.
Even if Russia released the DNC e-mails to wikileaks, which I don't believe, I am glad they did. It showed the corruption in the democratic party. Besides, whatever meddling Russia has done in foreign elections, the US in its history has done many times as much meddling, or even blatant overthrowing of democratically elected foreign governments. The US is truly a rogue nation, and this whole Russia story distracts from the real issues.
didn't know vlogbrothers became a conspiracy channel.
To my knowledge there is no evidence of any hack into the DNC servers. To the best of anyone's knowledge the DNC server was never hacked. If I am mistaken...could somebody please provide evidence of this malfeasance?
Hey everyone, remember when Boris Johnson went on a grand tour to tell us all to vote for Obama?  I guess that had no value.\n\nEDIT: Rereading this, it seems to hold a moral dimension I didn't intend, so as Barry might say, let me be clear: I'm saying no more or less than that foreign appeals on behalf of Obama (and, to a lesser extent, Kerry) have likely set a precedent for a narrow definition of value.
but what if Trump is trying to overthrow the deep state, at the same time not get assassinated like JFK
America messed in other country's elections so they deserve it. I give a pat on Putin's back for good work
Putin is one of the people who are making this world a worse place. He is supporting the mass murder Bashar al-Assad and horrible people around the world.
Even if the Russians did interfere with our elections, do Americans not realzie how many elections that the American government have interfered in
This video is almost TEN MINUTES long! Doesn't that mean a PUNISHMENT is in store?
Resist- Remove- Peace
With respect to the claims about Michael Flynn:\nIn 2015, Flynn received about $45,000 for attending Russian state TV network RT’s gala dinner in Moscow, where he sat next to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He also received $530,000 for consulting work that likely benefited the Turkish government while working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign.\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/michael-flynn-russia-payment-house-panel-investigation\n\nSo this is 'Russian influence on the election', via Flynn?  Or is Flynn supposedly working on behalf of Putin, and not, for example, Erdogan?\n\nI guess that 'Turkey hacked our elections!' wouldn't sell as well, and doesn't meet propaganda goals.\n\n(This example is a good indicator of the quality of this Putin-Trump nonsense.  It isn't quite lies -- mostly -- but it is incredibly distorted in a deliberate fashion to misrepresent the full truth.  One result is you make allies of idiot Trump supporters -- oh, and some racists who aren't technically idiots, I guess -- and those who oppose Trump but are more concerned about the 'Trump derangement syndrome' that leads to this insanity.)
I just hope trump supporters actually listen to the video instead of just yelling libtards,pc,leftist,sjws, at their screens. Smh
Damn it Mike. Lol, you expression just says it all.
Man that chick in the painting is kicking em out wide
Wow. Quality and Presentation written all over this restaurant.
I would have been the on customer to lick the plates
I think I lost weight from my mouth watering for 11 minutes... Hmmm
do you have to pay these restaurants any money to film inside?
This was really difficult to watch because of the painting behind you, the chef's accent,  and the house music that was playing in the background.  And for me, personally, the combinations of flavors and ingredients did not really look that appetizing.
A little too primal for me... but I would be lying if I said my mouth wasn't watering the entire time.
so who was holding the second fork ???
How can he eat so much without getting full!
Does mikey use gimbal?? 🤔🤔
Glad you liked Singapore I am from Singapore BTW
Sad to say this looks terribly pretentious and is presented with alot of intentional smokescreens. When he brought the ice-cream with no sugar then proceed to stab it with caramel..and kept saying, no sugar, that really took the cake with that kind of comment.
Oh, using all the cuts of pork. I thought it's about actually eating the whole pig.
I have been to Dehesa. It is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Every dish the chef serves is a flavour bomb.
I'm just gona come right out and say it, Mr. Chen, you are really a great critic, in the sence that you cut the hypocritical BS upper class swines love to impregnate humble and high end kitchens alike. \n\nWe commend you, aqui do Brasil.
Look out, you are getting fat
Loved how the chef explained each and every dish in detail. Thanks for uploading. 😊
i love your background music choices haha.
Wow. I love that food 😍
2:57 He has three arms?
I enjoy your videos as they are interesting, informative, and I get to travel with you to so many places.  All I can say about this meal is Better You Than Me, LOL, because I wouldn't have been willing to try any of it, except for maybe the dessert.  But I'm so happy that it was an amazing meal for you!  : D
the picture behind you at 2:10 ...why!!!!!!!!!!! lol
I NEED to be there!
My eyes 👀 went directly to the painting 😱
Come to newfoundland, we have the best seafood in the world. From cod fish to lobster.
What is the name of that instrumental you're using???
You make my food taste crap while watching this video. Thank you
i love mike so much but the auto focus drives me insane!
Good marketing when a restaurant reached out to a food channel.  Costs a miniscule amount in product to reach out to over 100k-400k people.
I live in Singapore
This was a delicious video as always but they were just using the nose to tail concept as opposed to actually featuring it.
From the rooter to the tooter. Well done!
This looks incredible! That beef cheek, and the pigs head dish omg...drooling lol
I love how he puts everything On the bread, the cheeks the fat the bone marrow and walnut. I love eating like that. All in one big bite.
An Chinese guy at a restaurant in Singapore ran by a French chef listening to American Rock and Roll
Love the painting in the back ground lol
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
I love how happy food makes you
The food looks good
Who was the second fork XD?
britney spears is mentally ill
🐷💕
that chef is AMAZING
Aww! You didn't show the hot pepper reaction!
Great food!! Can you do some tofu dishes in your future videos?
the dessert presentation was beautiful. the food overall looked amazing
Is this meal ok to eat if you are vegan?
4:44 am i the only one who kept noticing the background
Nice girlfriend in the background
Cats?? Do you have any cats??
i was amazed at what that chef can do his a food genius
The chef is french ?
TURN DOWN FOR WHAT
I sweat to god i am going there one day! I NEED THAT FOOD IN MY LIFE!!
I always wanted to go singapore, i will have to plan a visit there very soon.  What an amazing food
Hey Mike.... Turn down for what? Lol
Since no one mentioned.... Who's the girl next to you Mike? :)
I'd do anything to taste those cheeks...I mean anything....I'm talking butt stuff idec
Honestly, one of the best food adventure channels on Youtube. Keep up the great work Mikey!!!
Am I the only one who keeps salivating? 😂
Why can we not taste the food yet!? I mean c'mon [insert  company here] it's 2017!
So the cannibal version of this restaurant would be called head to toe.
Ice cream like a 65%
Anyone else notice that his video ends at 11:11 😂
Why does he have the pepper up his nose on the link to click the video. Fail
another great vid
I've eaten a whole animal before!\n\n\n\n\nI'm not even a teen yet...
Ha ha from asshole to appetite.  Love the background music.  Have you tried oxtail stew or rocky mountian oysters. Maybe fish cheek and tongue...the cheeks taste like scallops.  Fish eggs/spon.?  My husband likes odd dishes. Real odd. He even eats groundhogs. YUK.  I have had raw clams.
The painting behind tho😶😂... You know he did that on purpose lol
I can't focus on mike's food, my eyes keep on looking at the picture behind mike kinda distracting
2:55 how do you have 3 hands?
Jackie chan trying out food never looked better 👌🏼
Mike literally anything and everything,  and I love it
I'm running down the list of noodle sauces that would go well with those pig skin noodles.  Something with a chili bean sauce and vinegar plus other goodies would go well with the texture of the pig skin.
2:56 how many hands does it take to cut a sausage?
That's it! I'm buying a ticket to Singapore
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiAq_SU0ED1C6vWFMnw8Ekg  guys check out the food ranger
When are you going back to Poland would love to see that
That all looked so could that I could cry.
Mikey what is the name of this restaurant?
Just added this restaurant to my bucket list!!!!!!
the intro song is lit
lemi guess.. $300?
Wow! All the food looks delicious! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love bone marrow
That looked soooooo awesome.
Absolutely incredible video!
Dying to try that spicy sauce!
2:56 Mike has 3 hands ????
Absolutely sadistic

NUMBER 35 ON TRENDING
Voting is almost over ya Beautiful Bastards! Then we can all go back to doing... whatever it is we all do. lolololol. AGH. I'm gonna regret this Hooking Up thing, huh?
TYT are great!  Congratulations!  I still dig Philip DeFranco, however.
Blind nationalism and blind following of political party are the sole reasons Trump is in office.
About the NFL, don't be mad, they were kneeling to pray to Jesus that they would win the game. And they were kneeling so they could worship the flag.
Holy crap. I feel so bad for Weiner's (ex) wife. Poor woman doesn't deserve that.
You forgot to mention that Colin Kapernick wore socks that depicted police officers as pigs on the field and the NFL had no problem with that..  If he has a problem with the police as he used to say, instead of the flag, why not turn your backs on all police officers that are all around the field and stadium as security to protect the players and keep the peace??? Hmmm
I live in Canada and I am in the Canadian navy and I just don’t think this would never happen here, but as an active member in the navy I would feel sad too see Canadians ever doing this but everyone one does have the right to free of speech and protest. I would have tired a different less harsh approach to the situation the trump did.
I don't stand for the pledge or the flag. I hate Trump thats one reason. Two, I respect soldiers that have died, and I show my respect in many different way. I just refuse to stand for the pledge because I'm an atheist and I dislike the under God part.
Obama was the one who divided us more then any other, it'd sad they can't see that
Saying NFL players are protesting the flag is like saying Rosa Parks was protesting public transportation.
Phil, im not from the US i dont live in the US either but viewing your videos and coming across this one i wanted  ask... the entire drama with the kneeling and standing form something someone in your country believes in , is freedom and it should be respected, right? but where im lost is that if people have issue with someone expressing themselves how they want and get called names of worse why dont those same people stand against BIG companies that make money from selling clothing reflecting the US flag?...  isnt this also consider a form of disrespectful regardless on whether or not some believe is a form of carrying the love for country with in clothing? just trying to get a grip on the reality we in right now... since the entire world is watching :)
how many times has trump disrespected our country and no one calls him out on it and when they do its called fake news its sad that he is allowed to get someone fired because he wants to show how big he is? wow America i hope he demands others to get fired for his ego maybe then people will open there eyes
What boycott?  Week 3 was 3% UP over 2016.  The alt-right, sycophantic Trump drones are either lying about boycotting or lying about being fans in the first place.
You can't run for office with that last name lmao
Tony Romo has 2 playoff wins and Tim Tebow has 1. Come on! You hire people to check stuff like this.
I think america's obsession with their flag is kinda weird and unsettling. But of course in my experience, nationalism only ends up being a double edged sword
Not in handcuffs , but out work lol..
With all the shit going on right now we are wasting the power of the government arguing about glorified games a flag is only as meaningful as the people willing to die for it but those people gave there lifes to allow you the right to shit on it part of freedom of speech is that everyone has it  i disapprove of what you say, but i will defend to the death your right to say it there is more important things then worring what a bunch of over payed athletes are doing when we fix all the other horse shit thats happening then we can focus on this problem if we haft to
I don't know, at this point the NFL should just stop the national anthem from being played during games temporarily just to simmer down the conflict,  and just get to the game.
this is ridiculous, not standing is a right. Its the same as not standing during the pledge of allegiance, whether that be in school or in a sport.
I think the NFL situation is ludicrous. The same people who spout how everything that is negative about Trump is fake news but they pass around the fake NFL rule talking about how players /should/ stand at attention when the anthem is played when this is not even mentioned at all. Let alone the page that the rule is apparently on even existing. I think people should calm the hell down and maybe get angry at the cause of them kneeling and not them kneeling during the anthem.
The Young Turks is not news
Multiple veterans and active duty members of our military have spoken out in defense of kneeling during the anthem, so now we see a political organization whom is ignoring the people it's claiming to defend in order to stir up it's base.
You all realize that he dose this every time that there are more important this happening in the world. I understand that the protest by the players is important, but it has been going on for so long that it is back burner news. Trump used this to cover up his failure to get aid to those in Puerto Rico properly and on time as well it's a bigger distraction from him trying to start war with North Korea. There is a bigger picture here. Why are you falling for his shit Phil. Don't be part of the masses! Please! It's one of the things I love about u and ur show
L on both sides its very clear nfl shot at its target audience and trump shot at nfl its stupid on both sides
NFL = No Fans Left   Fans could protest at nfl parking lot choke points, perhaps  w/ rental cars or LARGE trucks that run out of fuel. What if people did this and lock the doors and walk away ! Imagine DOZENS of cars blocking the parking lot PRE GAME w/ HUNDREDS of cars behind them. It will take HOURS to clear up the mess and the nfl AND THE CRY BABY DISRESPECTFUL TEAMS would loose MILLION$ of dollars. Anti-PROTEST = ON!
Personally, it's all bs.this ain't news worthy when it comes to the NFL. You know, the NFL, that huge Cash cow that pays no taxes and has grossly overpaid players. It's going to bring the NFL views up and make more distractions for us to worry about.
I’ve given this a decent amount of thought. My social media feeds have been a slew of varying opinions on this topic. To denounce kneeling during the National Anthem is disrespectful to Veterans I think is an over generalization of what a Veteran is. We come from different backgrounds, socially, economically, and racially. “Veterans” isn’t a blanket statement that covers some autonomous thinking entity. Some Vets support the kneeling, some don’t. Please stop using all Veterans to bolster your argument, no matter the side.\n\nAs for my opinion on the matter. A protest needs to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. If it’s not one of these two things it can be ignored and a protest that can be ignored isn’t effective. \n\nFor decades Pro Athletes have been role models for kids. It’s not the same as another job. Someone working as a Pipe Fitter doesn’t have the same social impact on youth as someone who is on TV every week. That’s just the way it is. The NFL has awards for outreach into communities, this is something they want. To say that Athlete’s shouldn’t be political is to complete ignore their social importance to society.\n\nThe flag means more than just a representation of the military. The flag represents everything about this country, it’s history, the wars it’s fought, the economic depressions we’ve overcome, the scientific advancements we’ve achieved, and the social and economic adversities we still face today. To sum the flag up into just one of these causes is to ignore everything else about the country. I feel that goes for both sides of this argument.
The original player that refused to stand said why. But when i read it. All i heard was him sayin fuck this country in a nice way. He was deliberately disrespecting the country. For the other players to join them and now say thats not what they meant. Bullshit
14:40 freedom of speech, is freedom from legal punishment, not from social or fiscal consequences. You have a right to speak but not a right to be paid or empowered because of that speech. \n\nAdditionally if they were doing this for Christian or pro-American reasons we know they would pushed aside for less controversial players as those players have existed have been pushed aside in the past. \n\nNFL is under no legal obligation to play the national anthem. If they are not going to be patriotic about it, then don't bring it up at all.
Well... If you have a name like Weiner, this is what you should expect.
Someday this is gonna be a pretty high budget NFL movie.
I’m banned!  No more USA I guess.  ;)
If you’re a PROfessional, you should act like one. Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech outside of their line of work. IF you’re getting paid millions to play a sport that’s not so difficult, you should be thankful for that opportunity the your flag is giving you. It’s funny because most people taking a knee were poor no bodies in life and now that they make millions they think they still matter.
When a citizen while occupying the highest office of the land calls other citizens Son of Bitches he is not only being disgraceful to the Presidency but to the Constitution and not worthy of a salute!
White people acted like they care about black nfl players but calls Blm a satan spawns how hypocritical
I stopped following the NFL because there was way too many commercials and bullshit like national anthem and ceremonies to honor the troops killing people around the world. That's too bad because I really loved the sport.
Lol shut up Nascar, few years ago you were trying secede from America.
so tired of waking up to see what new dumb stuff that traitor president is doing..can't wait for the day I wake up to the news he is dead
The whispered message of whatever kneeling was to convey was overshadowed by the shout of disrespect.  It is the one communicating that bears the burden of making the message clear.  I would suggest a better way of communicating:  this may be an important message but it was lost in how it was communicated.
Why the fuck is the government interfering with private companies? this is big government at its finest
NASCAR suit on Donald trump, wow that's different
Dude Philip, why are you the clearest voice out there? We need more of you.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The facts are out there that up until 2009 it wasnt mandatory that the players be on the field at all for the anthem. In 2009 the government paid the NFL to have the players on the field during the anthem to help boost recruitment numbers. NFL didn't go political politics came to them. Passed that how many time have you been at a bar or a party at house and seen ppl talking and not removing hat's during the anthem and nothing get said to them so because these athletes make millions of dollars they get treated differently. I for one have always stood and removed my hat even wen driving I'll remove my hat, but when ppl don't do so in public I understand that that's their right to do so and I can't take that from them.
Still a racist travel ban. Agree on N. Korea, but you need to allow N. Korean refugees though
Can some explain YouTube blocking? I blocked pewdiepie and I still see his lame stuff
Taking a knee is no better than burning the flag.
12:59 Look more into this story, and what he's said about what happened.
Nothing says freedom like mandatory patriotism. It's like we're trying to be more North Korean than North Korea.
To be honest, I don't agree with kneeling during he anthem. I was raised the way that when the anthem comes on, I stand and put my hand over my heart (yes even in my house). However, I do believe police brutality is an incredible problem and should be protested. Do it like the Cowboys did it. Kneel before the anthem. But during show some respect.
I will always stand and respect our flag and anthem, but I I respect the right of other not to. However, what many are forgetting is that the players are employees. It would be well within the rights of a business owner to fire them as they were hired to play a game, not make a political statement.
I know this is going to sound very sour but Trump defiantly has his freedom of speech as well. I think its good that people aren't just in the background of these situations. Its good to flex the responses of people when freedom of speech gets put on the line. Its kind of wiping away the dust on our reasons to support our country in any sort of way. The challenge is good, annoying, but good.
I'm fine with the protesting, i know there's a lot of crap in this country, where i live i don't see it though, but i don't support it during the national anthem. It symbolizes a lot for any American who's lost a loved one or a friend in the military. So i say yes, do your protest, but leave it to a time not on a huge part of our countries culture, it's like throwing away maple syrup in canada. it's just not right.
the young turks won? ughh they have no class, no brains and no integrity. thats the only award they should win...that of sleeze bags
I believe people should have choice. But it really upsets me and I'm not even American. All those who died before us to allow us our luxuries now it's shameful to me. I don't think people should be fired outright but I think more people should be supporting their country and those fighting or who died for it instead of disripcting it from their comfy chairs heir expensive shoes stood on the football field. Shameful
Part of what has made the United States great is the fact that people are allowed to floss their ass with the flag in protest: They're allowed to demean our symbols. I thought it a tacit statement that the principles of our nation, the culture of our nation, and the people of our nation are so strong and resolute that we cannot be offended by such actions: We'll let you have your say. And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting. The anthem is just a song and the flag is just a piece of fabric; no matter how they're robbed of their beauty it can't (or at least shouldn't) affect who we are as a country.
Kneeling for the flag=ok.Staying in locker room=not ok.imo
I don't know about y'all, but sports is supposed to be something we can watch to get away from politics. I think that the players should either stand or stay in the locker room but at the same time, Trump is ORDERING people to fire players! Sounds like dictatorship to me!
Being critical of your country isn't disrespectful, seems like a lot of the south has forgotten that.
They have a right to be free of arrest for grossly disrespecting the ideals of the country.  Everyone has a right to deny their hard earned money to them and to their employers.  Boycott until fired!
If you’re upset about people protesting during the national anthem of the football, you’re unpatriotic and you don’t believe in the principles and values of America. Yes that means you too Trump.
The American flag is often portrayed as a symbol of freedom, equality, and other goals that people fight and have fought to make a reality. In that sense the flag represent the country we want to become. I don't believe the people refuse to stand because they want to disrespect those goals and hopes for the US. They are trying to make a point that who we are and what most of us will say that flag represents are two very different things, that the flag as a symbol does not yet represent this country as a whole and we have to keep fighting to work toward that ideal.
As someone who has marched with the fucking flag across Safeco Field in Seattle, as a soldier in the US Army who has served in some form since I was in fucking high school, and as as a fucking Eagle Scout  - I need to say that Kaepernick not only has the right to kneel, but he was spot-on.\nDonald Trump is using this excuse of the knee to further divide the fabric of American society. If he is successful at dividing Americans in the arena of what is probably America's greatest religion - sports - than we are one step closer to loosing this nation.\nI don't know who Trump is doing this for - whether he is trying to bring back the glory of the Confederacy and have it finally secede from the Union, or if he is a secret Nazi, or if he is a Russian puppet - but every single thing he does is one step closer to the end of this fucking country.
You say you accept the players right to kneel but you don't like it. What don't you like? Do you not like peaceful protest? Do you not believe there is in justice? I don't understand.
The Flag means so much more than what you agree or disagree with. Men and women have sacrificed their LIVES so you can have the freedom to be a football player and make millions. No matter what you're political beliefs are, or if you like or dislike the current president, the flag needs to be respected. Regardless of our right of freedom of speech, I think it is and should be one of those  unwritten rules that the flag is not disrespected. What it stands for is far greater than what people are trying to protest by disrespecting it.
Man Anthony Weiner showing he didn't have a grip on his D-Brand.
Only 3 days old and boy o boy didn't the NFL do the opposite of your comments. Lol
Who would have thought I would ever defend a sport team even crazier a whole association for lack of better words, here's the annoying orange trying to separate the country once again. I thought we had freedoms in this country but I see their slowly fading away and being replaced with one sided patriotism and none sense SAD. I will never deny that people died defending this country it would be stupid to do so, but last time I checked they died defending our freedom to choose because that's what the United States is about. I was thought as an outsider to have respect the flag which I agree, but most of the time some of those people showed little to no respect towards who I am. Yes I am an immigrant but I have nothing but love and respect towards my country of origin and the United states and I side with Kaepernick this time. Until we fix all the inequality in this country I wouldn't stand for the anthem either because I don't feel free and sometimes even represented well with current government.
People might be more inclined to support the players if they werent such HUGE hypocrits! For decades police turned a blind eye to crimes committed by NFL players. Crimes like sexual abuse, rape, DWI, beating their wives (OJ is a good example here) and they, the players, didnt seem to have a problem with the police then! NFL players are dispropotionately arrested on domestic abuse, rape, sexual abuse, and a plethora of other charges, than the rest of the population. Shouldnt they clean their own house before critisizing others dirty houses?They are protesting what is also a false narrative as the stats just dont support what they claim to be protesting. Instead of protesting the problem 672 steps down the line how about protesting the fact that 6% of the population commits over 50% of violent crimes? How about prostesting the black on black violence and murder rate? How about the black abortion rate? Where are all the youth centers and mentor programs their millions of dollars could build and fund? How many black youths do they work with, and i dont just mean throwing money at the problem.Sure, they have a right to protest but protesting the National Anthem/Flag because of police brutality is like protesting God and the faithful because a bunch of priests are pedophiles.Also, I have the right to protest too but if I did it at my job I would be FIRED! There is a time and a place and while you are being paid millions to play a game is not the time or place to stick your middle finger up to people paying you to PLAY! If this really means that much to them they should address the problems directly, to the people being affected, not just tar every single police officer in the country.I get why they dont do that....because only having a few cases here or there doesnt get them near the attention that doing it during a nationally televised game does.They are presenting it like every police force has every other officer only targeting black people and that is as far from the truth and as false/misleading as the Hands up, dont shoot false, made up narrative that was spun by MSM.
My brother is Army. Brother in law, Airforce. Husband... my entire world... Navy...\nStanding for the anthem, respecting the flag, is for those lost in the fight for freedom. Just because you CAN do something, doesnt mean you SHOULD. My husband hates what is happening. He thinks it is absolutely disgusting. He said he doesnt want your respect, but the fallen MORE than deserve it. \nKneeling is a slap in the face to those lost. And a slap in the face to the families of those lost.\nThey are multi millionaires. Their fanbases are enormous. There are soooo many different ways they could make their point known, without disrespecting the fallen.\nMy husband isnt an NFL fan, but i WAS. i refuse to give them anymore of my time or money, because they arent deserving of it.\nThese celebrities forget that the only value they hold to the vast majority of people ends the second they no longer entertain us. Or rather, the second them entertaining us comes at too great of a cost, or too big of an inconvenience.\nTrump likes to take things way too far, every chance he gets. This situation is no exception. I can say though that i agree with the call for a boycott.\nJust as they have the right to be disrespectful little shits to the men and woman who died for that right... we have the right to stand against their disgusting disrespect, and take away the one thing that matters most to them, their money.\nIf you continue to watch nfl, that is your decision and your right. But i certainly wont be. And neither will MANY of my friends.
Bullsh!t, Phil. Thats a crappy right in the middle of the road opinion you got, trying not to offend anybody and be 50/50 its everybody's fault BS. \nDid anybody (anybody) asked Kaepernick when he planned to stop protesting? What was his criterias? When zero minority is oppressed in this country? Was he planning to protest the National Anthem until the end of his f*cking career? \nPhil, enough. \nA f*cking football game isnt the place to protest the flag and the National Anthem because you're not happy about something. \nYou can protest before the game, after the game, publicly, privately, online, whatever. \nBut the football fans, who are held hostages and are forced to watch you also have the right to walk away. \nAnd thats what they're doing. \nThe players didn't understand that its not the NFL that pays their huge salaries. \nIts the fans. \nIts the eyeballs in front of the screens. \nThese players didn't think this thing through.
Real men stand up for what they believe in; they don't kneel 🇺🇸
On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.
There's a time and place for everything. When you're at work that's not the time...
This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\n\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.
Being patriotic is a great way to become a racist. The flag is a piece of cloth. We don't need these things.\n\nBut someone who'd disrespect their own country in the way the NFL did don't sound to me like they have anyone's best interests at heart. It's those who appreciate America who can do the most good making it better. Anti-American actions like taking a knee only give support to those who want to see America toppled. Stand with America, and see it heal instead. You have to care about your country to mend it.\n\nI say this as an Englishman who can see what a fucked up place America is. But damn guys, respect the place you owe so much of you success to! If you wanna join a Black Lives Matter protest do that on your free time.
If you don't support your worst enemy having free speech, you don't support free speech what so ever. What you support are safe spaces, because if the 'beacon of freedom' can't be criticised, what's even the point of freedom of expression?
I'd also like to add that most players are not trying to disrespect the anthem. Kneeling before it is a mode of protest. I respect anyone who may not like it still, but still respect that people can/should be able to practice their right. As to why I feel it should be okay, Nick Wright said it best: https://youtu.be/e0RZ4-XmcCM?t=310
Giving their lives for this country... I support soldiers and vets, and not superficially so... respecting the flag is stupid, when so many neglect the people to whom you say the honor is given. It should also be noted, that not only soldiers have given their lives for our freedoms in this county. As an African America, I find it disingenuous to say that people fighting overseas in 3rd world countries has improved my rights as an American citizen, with so many soldiers with my skin tone coming back over here to witness the realities of this county.  We have martyrs of civil liberties and rights who did not fight in any war, who gave their lives to change things. If you want to honor soilders, make sure they're coming back to a country that isn't divided, make sure their families are taken care of while their overseas or if they die, make sure they are taken care of... until then stop the bullshit.
The problem people keep forgetting for the NFL is they are protesting on the job. Go ahead go protest at your work place. I will tell you what will happen you are going be fired. Because you are there to work. Not to play games, have sex or to protest. Do that on your time. Your own personal time. Second off they can leave this country and see what real oppression is. Sorry I think this NFL players are in the wrong. If they want to protest in work. Then just take a knee in the middle of the game and spend the rest of the game kneeing. I can tell you these guys are hypocrites. They give no care about what they truly say they do.
Sports don't bring people together. Sports foster a tribal us vs them attitude
Why do you guys even play the national anthem and salute your flag at every sporting event? Seems like the sort of thing they would do in a totalitarian state like North Korea, rather than a free democracy. Why does your flag have to intrude on every single little aspect of your lives? Do you have to salute the flag whenever you go for a coffee or take the dog for a walk, too?
Why does YouTube make me re sub to phill every week :(
Yo I believe you can protest, dont really bother me. I just find it hilarious that the most privileged people, these athletes that get paid millions, more women than you can count and get treated like gods daily, cry about injustice and inequality. How many of them have really known it? How many had to live in a 1 bedroom house with their 9 siblings and carry water to their bath tub in the front yard? How many run ins with the cops did they really have growing up, like 1 or 2? Did they really struggle through college, working 2 jobs, playing sports and doing their own homework? Or have they been privileged the whole time because of their sports ability (and the hard work that they put into solely that)?
Wow, Defranco reference to Kapernik' stance against dirty political views in the NFL as shit and a circus really proves that even when head injuries became into the equation that it too was too much of act and obligations of the NFL to oversee and make 100% sure that everyone is taken care of on much larger scale. Puts the whole I need fan votes into perspective.
affect our AGENDA yeah exactly fucker !
Retarded americans..incredible!
ja
Sucks
Mickey mantle doesn't pay my rent
Stop commenting.
Just gotta say lebron james- SHOTS FUCKIN FIRED xD that burn was beautiful
What disease does weener have?
patriotism really seems like a cult tbh
I'm with NFL. It's a beautiful protests for a good cause and Trump should just stop making shit big. These players are acknowledging that there are these flaws in America and until they are fixed, they do not want to proudly stand to the anthem and I get it. Especially for the minority background or race players, this is important. If I came to America, I would be a minority. If there were enough lithuanians to be mistreated and heard about, I would dp the same
You guys over on that side of the pond need to chill, no need to be triggered when someone doesn't stand for the anthem/flag xD
Trump is condeming people for expressing their freedom of speech peacefully and rexpectfully, when it takes two days for him to make a small comment on teh KKK saying extremely racist and terrible things, and immediately goes on a rant about people peacefully protesting about social injustice, this reveals him as truly unamerican at heart.
I'm disliking DeFranco's videos more and more. How much can a whiny liberal gush and bleed over nothing?
As stated in our declaration of independence, whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.  Regardless of what the protesting is about these people are kneeling because there is a problem and they want to make change which is their god given right as American citizens. The first step to solving a problem is admitting that there is one which is exactly what these role models of society are doing while they exercise their first amendement rights.

I feel like you already did this before! Dejavue. Just like the video where you tested the Derma-high-coverage foundation! :D
I thought that only i have got one easy-brow and one hard-brow x)
I really like the thicker brow on the left.
Hey !! Just one suggestion- start giving marks out of 10 to the products u review. That would be good. Love your videos. :*
I CANT BELIEVE YOUR GOING TO HELLOWORLD ARGH I AM SO EXCITED
I think this could actually work for me!? Still better than doing it all with my clumsy hand! LOL :D
The product is pretty good may try it myself 😊
What foundation are you wearing here. Your skin looks great
I Need that! 😳
Not lucky one... Wish I could 😨😞

I HATE THIS FAKE VIDEOS.
Great fake translate talksport keep it up to be a liar 👍👍👍
This is all lies
Women now have bigger balls than men. lol what a time to be alive!
Oklahoma needs a team !!! We’ll take 2 !!!!  Best hits this century!!
Finally, some football players with balls!
LFL about to get popular, fuck the NFL
They act more like men than the pussy NFL players with their fe fees.  Thx LFL.  Subscribed.
Looks like I just became a fan!! Great job lady's. Support you all the way!
The NFL can go rot. I won't watch it again until I see official apologies from every player, coach and owner....and Goodell had to apologize in a press conference and then resign
I think it would be nice to see the LFL go more mainstream in place of the NFL. They deserve it!
You summed it up perfectly. Honestly, I never heard of LFL before seeing this video.\nYou ladies just gained a new fan.
America !  haters gona hate...
It's unnessary to undermine the real fight against police brutality.
I guess I WILL be watching football...  Just not thr NFL.
Thank you ladies. I left the nfl, coming to you. The Flag and National Anthem should never be disrespected. Thank you!!!!
Well I'm switching to the LFL...and good for them. The women play a better, harder hitting game too !
PEAK IDEOLOGY
As of this posting 228 communist pigs have watched this video.\nPatriots, give this video a thumbs-up!!!
How come this is the first I've heard of this League?????   When do they play !  Now this is football !  Patriots, each an everyone !
😮, 🙄, 😁😃😄😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🎆🗽
Man, sometimes it sucks to be gay.
You guys are great! If you ever have a game in Tennessee I'll be there or better yet maybe start a team in Tennessee!
Thank you! I greatly appreciate the respect that you show for our flag, and those who have fought to defend it. You are now my football league of choice.
When the LFL is more legit then the NFL.
To be honest I must be living in a bubble because I have never watched this football league here but I respect them so much more then I do the NFL players now. Thank you ladies for being tougher and more patriotic then these coward NFL players and owners.
We are not protesting the flag you morons. just tell the cops to stop killing inocent black dudes and we'll stop kneeling.
Thank you LFL! Sure wish the National Felons League had your guts.
You know what's more disrespectful to or American flag? The confederate flag.
But yet people didnt have a problem with Kid Rock cutting a hole in the american flag and wearing it as a poncho.....even though that is against the Code of the flag.....This is a free country. They have the right to kneel and you have the right to be mad and not watch.  All you people are so against dictators but yet you want to force your ideals on to other people.
Can I identify as a woman and play in this league?
Hell yeah!
Ahh Football without the protests!!! I'm in!!
I guess the only league game I will watch from now on. Salute you all.
The greatest country, huh!? Without own history.
It's just comical that this was all started by a one season wonder qb who was raised by a white couple in Wisconsin.
They should replace the  NFL with the LFL, Why would you rather watch men tackling each other when you can watch women tackle each other in their underwear.
Thank You LFL.
Good job ladies!
ok! i'm in, what channel?
TRUE PAYTREEUTS
I'd watch it!
RIP NFL
This is the best timeline
I'm more of a rugby guy, but I wouldn't mind watching this. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Now this is a league I could support & games I could watch.
I Stand with the Lovely/Athletic Ladies of the LFL....Yeah Buddy!!!
So these ladies have bigger balls than all those kneeling NFL boys.
yeah fuck the nfl this is the brilliant
Are the 220 thumbs down by the NFL Snowflakes who kneeled? #BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors
This is great news least these woman show love for this country unlike those fuckers in the NFL. Much love to you lady's and thank you.
I'd rather watch these girls play anyway.
God Bless you all!!!!!
If we disrespect the flag and our institutions we open the door for Communism and loss of our freedoms, we must never let that happen. Cultural Marxists are working patiently and steadily at destroying our institutions, most are not as obvious or as well publicized as the kneeling issue but they are just as important. To understand what is happening here see YouTube videos on The Frankfurt School and Cultural Marxism this will let you see the grand plan to destroy our country and way of life.
Get a team in philly and I will get season tix! Good for you ladies, I stand with you
Why doesn't the LFL not have their own superbowl yet?
Women aren't equal either,  they should be protesting as well.
LFL is better than the panzies of the kneelFL
Thank you, ladies!
much love you ladies from a man who was never interested in sports to begin with. i hope you become bigger than the NFL. us patriots are behind you
So we've finally gotten to the point where the women of this country are more of a man then the men are. Congratulations you bunch of fucking cry baby snowflakes
Subbed.
The people have the balls to stand for their own country, oh wait they don't have balls.
and yet somehow the dislikes are super high . I do not believe people actually dislike this stance the LFl is taking and trolls have infected the dislikes on this channel post .  People who support the flag of this country make sure to hit like to stop the losers who think it is cool to disrespect our nation and its symbols!  LFL football sounds like a gimmick but watch a game and you'll see more than just sexy women in pads ! This is really football and it's a pretty good football game  to watch and the women are beautiful on top of that .  They hope to reorganize my Green Bay Chill and I hope we get that team back on the field soon because with the NFL screwing us over Wisconsin is looking for another football team to back !
MLAR
You just improved your stock market value by double digits!  A CLASS ACT, for sure!
Please!!! Have games at the same times as the NFL!!
lfl should be come America sport
Any LFL player, no matter how good or sexy, who refuses to salute the flag or national anthem should be banned.
LFL Rocks - The men from the NFL should be humbled by your patriotism and honor you give your nation.  Thank you!
I live in Scottsdale Arizona and would definitely support an AZ team if they eventually have one.
They got bigger balls than the NFL pussies
I support you even more for this, but unfortunately their are a lot of Anti-American people, who think protesting the Flag that give's them the right to protest, will do something good, it won't, it will just destroy the county that gave them that right in the first place, and then they'll have nothing.
🚀
FOR AMERICA
LOVE this! Very well done LFL.
Yup fight for your rights when the only way females get noticed playing football is when you're half naked and looked at as sex symbols.
It's amazing how everyone is an American until they bare their right to freedom of speech then all of a sudden they are not Americans anymore. Nice.
Lol... what a joke.\n\nOf course they're standing... they're 97% White.\n\nDuh.
Awesome thank you!
 >when women have bigger balls then men\nwhat a world we live in right now. 
hey NFL take a look at your replacements! Ironic that these ladies have more cojones than the so called men of the NFL (No Fans Left)
THIS IS FUCKIN AWESOME.\nFuck the NFL, bunch of cry babies who made millions, some of them get 1 mill per game - , mostly blacks who can't stand the fact that Donald Trump is white and he's a Patriotic President. They  are used by Zionists, Liberals and all this is Pushed by mass media owned by Zionist Jews - CNN, ABC, NBC or ESPN.
LFL rocks!!! I'm buying tickets to watch the LFL!
Screw the N F Hell, I respect those who show respect. LFL > NFL
These ladies are true patriots.
Bless you LFL!
What kind of butthurt liberal snowflakes downvote this vidya?
Only asshole democrats think the American flag only represents only white Americans. America is a country where any race can be successful because every race is a American. So many rich black men yet they think they are oppressed. Screw you anti American pro criminals democrats....
Well looks like I found my NFL replacement
Bravo!!!
I cant begin to describe how proud of the LFL for standing up FOR the Flag of this great Nation. Thank you so much!
Good 4 the women's league..a new fan !
I am NOW officially a fan of the LFL!!
Subbed. NO MORE NFL.
Statement of LFL supporting the protesting of the National anthem\nhttps://youtu.be/7AhJsVTgnq0
There's a time and place for protest, your workplace is not a great choice!
Why was i not told this exists !
The only ones that agree with this obvious racist I Stand bullshit are the ones proud of the murdeous heritage. If you took a second to read about the history of how America came to me, you’d understand how the flag doesnt mean the same for everyone. \nI find the flag completely offensive because I had to learn the history that was denied to me. So fuck you Trump, LFL, and any other stupid incompetent dumb piece of shit who refuses to acknowledge that white supremacy is the root of all things evil and why this country has flourished. WE built this country so YOU get the fuck out.
The anthem says One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Its a good idea that America never applied into unbias action. You stand and place your right hand over your heart quickly for a peice of cloth, on a song about war. When was the last time you stood up and placed your hand there for God? THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT ALL DO NOT GET LIBERTY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT JUSTICE!!!\nIf you love your country, drop to one knee. Tell her I love you baby, but your wrong and work on getting her right. If you love America stop feeling love for a damn peice of cloth and feel the pain of AMERICANS around you!!!! The athletes are doing it for AMERICANS, and GOD! Would you place your hand over your heart for a LIE?
DOD has paid all professional sports teams to have players stand for national anthem to get recurits and manipulate the people into supporting it's jesuit Zionist Global war on Terror .  Supposedly Senate did not agree with this spending but happened anyway
this divide is getting out of hand.once again,people are kneeling not to protest against our troops but protesting b/c we are not upholding WHAT THEY FOUGHT AND DIED FOR!!!!!😧 How can we fight for nations to have democracy when EQUALITY and JUSTICE for all is clearly still a problem in our OWN nation.i will kneel because this is not what they died for when a cop can stop a 10 year old boy and shoot him in cold blood and get away with it.THINK. AMERICA.THINK.
WOW!!! A league of hot ass bitches more American, more Patriotic, and more Respectful than the pathetic, over-paid, premadona,  useless asshole NFL'rs. AWESOME.
Kuwait in the summer got to 59 or 60 Celsius for a few days
Can you please do a EU vs BRICS military comparison?
Me I'm the hottest thing on earth
Orange yellow??? I thought it was the closest colour and that's blue white isn't it?
1. Me\n2. Myself\n3. I\n4-100. All other stupid stuff on the show
Finally an American show that shows things in Celsius as well so everyone else knows what they mean
Actually in Kuwait it reached 63 c degrees this year. Highest recorded in an urban city. In the desert it could reach more.
In a wood kiln you can reach temperatures of about 2600F before you star to mess up the pyrometer
The U.K is not divided on wether to use celsius or fahrenheit at all, we *only* use celsius. I can’t think of a single situation in which fahrenheit has been used here since schools stopped bothering to teach it in the 60’s, because it was a useless thing to learn.
Do a video about finland vs russia.
Yugoslavia vs UK or USA
How you are making videos
Where is my GF on the list?
why don't you try BRICS nations and EUROPEAN UNION comparison I will like to see it
hottest things on earth \n\n\n\n\ncar at summer 1000°c\nmetal slide at summer 1500°c\nnewly cooked bacon 1750°c\nusing your cellphone for hours 10,000°c\nyour mom 1000000000°c\ngetting burned,friendzoned,roasted,rejected at the same time 10000000000000000000000000000°c
no one uses fahrenheit in the UK any more. Changed over to celsius decades ago
I am so hot that even the sun cowers in pain.
How hot did the Cleveland Indians get, when they won 20 games in a row?
Fahrenheit makes no sense. If you want accuracy, use Kelvin instead.
Came down for the mixtape comments
Explains how almost the whole world uses Celsius and proceeds to saying the temperatures in the video in Farenheit... *facepalm*
I've never heard anyone use anything but celsius in the UK
A notable portion of your facts are off on nearly every video. UK is not divided on their temperature measurements. If they are, it is as much as me - one person - primarily using the metric system in the US. Most household ovens go up to 260 degrees (500 Fahrenheit). Daniel Fahrenheit was German, not Dutch. Seriously, every single damn video spews false information. I like the videos, and the animation, but get your shit together.\n\nEdit: Fahrenheit did do most of his research in Amsterdam, but he was from Germany.
When I was working in Saudi Arabia last year, we spent a weekend in the desert at the height of summer, and their thermostat at the Bedouin read 65 degrees Celsius... I told them that that seems a bit high and suspected that it might have been the instrument that heated up more than the temperature outside, but I must admit, that was the hottest natural heat I have ever experienced.
You failed to mention my last mixtape.
you know what's hot right now my frys 🔥
The hottest thing EVER is \n\n\n\n\n\nME
Surprisingly I didn't make it on this list
Please compare Samsung and apple company's
Me
I live in the UK and have never heard anyone use Fahrenheit so I can’t say we’re divided
stop using fahrenheit, the rest of the world uses celsius smh
No one in the UK uses Fahrenheit.
In the UK we exclusively say celcius at least in Scotland.
The hottest recorded place was in in Algeria was 140°
it was 63c in kuwait this year, i went their for summer vacation.... which was more like stay indoors.
well.. I'm hot af so yeah :'D
Why if you said that every one uses Celsius (except 2) you keep using fahrenheit? It is time to enter the international system of measures... even when you explain things
Im the hottest thing in the world dudes
Uhh no you messed up the hottest part of the flame is the blue piece. Fix it now
 It depends on which Volcano you are sitting in 
This video is so hooooot!
Why isn’t your mom on this list?
We don't use Fahrenheit here in the UK at all.
Fahrenheit is a concept which is over 300 years old. \n\n\nUse metric and Celsius, it is much more simplified and modern.
Did you just imply that you're a proponent of imperial measurements? I just lost so much respect for you dude.
No division - the UK uses Celsius.
The hottest thing is my ringpiece after eating a vindaloo & full jar of jalapeño peppers
Can you make a video about indonesia vs north korea ?
Celsius is in base 10, easier to record and do science with..
i see its on trending so i helped to like
Well there is a thing called Plank+1, Which was unofficially named as MNMT, or Maximum Nuclear Molecular Temperature, which to some, was a bit of a mouthful, so I just shortened it to...\n\n\n\n\n\nMy New Mix Tape
I hope everyone complaining about him using Fahrenheit realize that he put the Celsius temp next to it
Bro im in Kuwait wile sweating looking at this. This summer it was 128 😡 cant wait to go back to the states. 🙌🇺🇸
Surprised i wasnt on the list
You can't follow up something we created at 7 trillion degrees. With 6000.
Even my crush is hot
In the UK we never use Fahrenheit!
Why am I not on the list?
Temp of a blackhole?  I know it has to be hot!  A black whole video would be cool.
You know what's hotter?\n\n\n\n\n\nMy crush
Made me sad in the beginning. I love this planet 😢😭
the uk isn’t divided, we definitely only use celcius. its just the us who uses fahrenheit lol
Totally awesome that's really really hot .you done an excellent job on this..Thank you so much for your videos and everything you do.
I thought is titled Hottest Woman in the Planet
Me right now. That is the hottest a person has ever been.
Everyone saying where is my ( there) mix tape \n*Irony* \n\n\n\n\nBut where is my *phone* ?
Singapore vs malaysia
Do Mexico vs U.S.
Australia regularly reaches those temperatures as well. It's the start of spring here and it was just 40 degrees Celsius
My head is hotter when I get mad
yall forgot kylie jenner
Where's Emma Watson?
They forget to mention Airhostess !!!
AZ
*Celsius Master Race*
Fahrenheit was german
Just use Celsius..
uk is fully Celsius
You forgot me
Hottest thing? Ur mom
Gf
My mix
Anyone who uses Celsius= 1 like
Y'all forgot something...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mixtape
I know something even hotter\n\n\n\n\nMy mixtape
Fahrenheit? Seriously?
nothing else is hotter than jamal's mixtape
The hottest thing is Dashie's mixtape
Me.

Is it me or anyone else want only celsius?
i love you guys so much, thank you for always being there for me through everything
YOU HAVE FUCKING HORSE TEETH GO EAT SOME FUCKING GRAIN AND SWEET FEED GO RUN OFF INTO A FUCKING MEADOW YOU SWEET BOOTY BITCH
Thank you for always being so honest and transparent.  You have a gift, and are insanely talented.  I'm glad I watched this video though, because based on the title alone, I almost unsubscribed, thinking you were going to stop doing YouTube......
Loved this video so much. Thanks for being so open with us, I agree being internet famous seems great but even I know I couldn't imagine how much hate you guys receive and money cannot buy happiness and y'all need a social media break sometime! You guys are all watched under a microscope and yes it's what you signed up for but doesn't mean it can't get exhausting! You're human and we all need to realize that we're all human we all fuck up and we all should be able to move on and LIVE!
I liked the eye look before you cut the crease. You could've left it like that. It was beautiful
Omg! i didn't know that was that much negativity! and i been warching you for a while and i didn' t think that i should say, because i think that you weren't that affected about all that, but keep going on what you do! and keeo smiling!💕
maybe lick your lips once in a while....i'm tired of seeing that dried up crust line on the corner of your mouth 😂
You're absolutely amazing and gorgeous, not just your face but your personality. Don't let the hate get to you because there's so many people that look up to you and love you. Keep being you and keep being a fantastic role model❤️ love you sister😘❤️
i just started watching your videos and IM IN LOVE WITH YOU AND ALL THAT YOU STAND FOR 💖💖 and ur so beautiful inside and out keep doing you boo!
am i the only one who doesnt even realize he talks fast lol
Omg you are such a beautiful human.I remember when I first started watching you and I wanted all my friends to watch you too.But they didn't like that you were a guy doing makeup. So I said the hell with them because you are such a positive person who gives me life.Love You Sister Forever❤❤
i want to go to college not to do my makeup on camera lol. sorry if people get butt hurt but yeah. i don’t think he isn’t grateful or anything so anyways.. yeah i forgot my point. omg i am so dumb lol.
This is random but this eyeshadow look is gonna look great with my homecoming dress sending love ❤️
Stay strong I love you so much you are such an inspiration to me, i just your code James for 10% at morphe! 😍😝
You talk so fast, it's kinda cute haha
MY biggest thing is you did Tati's wedding makeup and all shit n stuff aside your 18 you live and learn at that age and I LOVE LOVE LOVE your energy. Try not to let all the fame go to your head which is something a lot of kids deals with when they grow up. Love your video I subscribed
I love you❤️❤️❤️ you are the best in the world ❤️
i love you sister
You are so beautiful and such a kind person. Please don't let someone with only a keyboard and a negative mind set get to you. You deserve all the happiness in the world❤️ love you sister
Every time A You-tuber has a Click bait video I'm always going to thumbs down. You deserve for lying.
You should make tana into you 😂❤️
I just want to bring a little light to this but me when I have an exam😂😂😂
This video is so true. Happiness 100% at the end of the day can not be fulfilled  with money! I look up to you for sticking through the rough patches that being a social media influencer brings! ❤️❤️❤️
James is the only person on the entire internet that I can watch for 14 minutes straight
Does he even breath? I think he is a robot
OMG he talks so fast it's so hard to keep up 😅
I say be you! It don't matter what they say. Their just jealous! ;) Love ya Sister!!! <3
Slow down!  I'm sure companies like CoverGirl would like people to actually understand what you're saying about their products. By the way, you provide links to other cosmetics brands in the info, but no link to CoverGirl?  Thoughts, +covergirl ?
The purple lip would've been better.
the white saliva dried on the corners of his bottom lip is bothering me :(
You are so good at make up👍👍👍👍
I'd never want to get into a debate with James Charles...LMAOOOOO speed talking to the max
go jjjjaaammmeeesssss!!!!!! you tell them sister. love uu
JamesCharles, you are absolutely PRECIOUS!!! Keep doing you. ❤️
This eye look is so beautiful 😍
aw i love you so much!! and everything you do, keep up the good work and try to block out the hate.
Yoh need to react to a video ok Jake Waden he is literaly your little self .
please please please go on tour!!!! hit up northern cali ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you 😍
I love that noise you make!!
First world problems..... Its not that serious.
Awh James you are such an amazing inspiration to me, I honestly enjoy your videos so fucking much! Whenever you post it makes me sooooo happyyyyy:) Make sure you're looking after yourself babe, love yaaaa💓
You talk too fast can't bearly understand what your saying -_-
Only TRUE sisters can understand James at his full talking speed. ❤️ #Sisters4Life
I love u James 💗 💗 💗 💗
These haters that are posting comments, I feel like they do this for a living 😂 I love you James. You keep your head up and continue to a bad ass!
Thank you so much for addressing this. Being honest, I wasn't a fan of yours, but watching this video and hearing what you had to say really changed my perspective. You're young, talented and we all make mistakes (and hopefully grow from them!) Happiness is elusive and it's refreshing to actually hear an influencer admit that he went through a tough time when social media portray so many things as perfect and flawless. <3 Take all the time you need and best of luck.
oh stop it you're not leaving! you do this shit all the time it's getting so old already!
Can we see a video where you transform Tana into you??
omg the tumbnail in wanna see him crying not this boring vid like if You agree i hate this
You are stunning even bare faced.

This video on fast forward.
A little of a clickbaiiiiiiiit

Just be you cause guess what it’s good to be different. no one cares if ur different. be and love your self. love u sister💓
You're my favorite and I love the fast pace. Amazing. Love you sister
Omg another im leaving YouTube we all know you're not.  It's like that girlfriend that tells her boyfriend shes leaving in hopes that her boyfriend begs her to stay, which he doesn't nd she ends up staying cause literally there's nothing else. BOY stop with the click bait, seriously, its beneath you.\n\nPs not sure if i should like there video cause the title says he's leaving or dislike it cause hes not nd cause he talks to fast its annoying af!
Love you James!!!! Keep doing what your doing and try to ignore those hateful people out there.  They need to work on themselves
man, I kinda like his vids, but it's soooo hard to follow talking extremely fast and the click bait tho!! lol
I love your makeup, I think you are very taken but You talk way too fast, hard for me as a foreign to keep up 😓
He blinks so much is there a reason? I’m a New sub!
Why? Tell me why? First my best friend leaving the school and moving to Romania.. Now you're leaving Youtube! Why is my life so miserable.. :(
ignore the haters boo boo i think your doing an amazing job <3
fucking attention seeker with the clickbait. WE HATE CLICKBAIT AS MUCH AS U HATE MEAN OR NEGATIVE COMMENTS
Can you please use the Jaclyn hill palette again?????
You’re always talking about how you wanna leave or that you’re leaving and using it as clickbait , it’s not right to your supporters that come to watch your videos because they’re genuinely concerned and come to find out it’s just a sponsored video. If it’s that bad you feel the need to talk about it all the time just leave 😊👋🏼
James Charles I've been born with Cerebral Palsy and am a teenager who is fighting depression... fucking depression and you're my role model. Bless you!
I JUST ORDERED THE YELLOW SISTERS HOODIE! I LOVE YOU JAMES😍❤️😂
CLICKBAIT
Is this click bait
I clicked so fast
H
That flawless skin 😍😍😍😍
His eye makeup 😍😭
I love your smile 😁😍😍
Pretty Cool
Click BaitEist move I've ever seen 😂
We got bean boolzed
stop fucking using clickbait its so annoying.
I hate clickbait sooo much
noooo don't leave youtube
Clickbait bitch.  Had my hopes up.
I haven't watched this yet but is this a clickbait cause I HATE clickbait so much.
I don't understand why everybody talking about he talked too fast. I can understand everything he saying perfectly fine. if you can't understand what he's saying then don't watch. why should somebody have to change the pace of their talk because your brain is not capable of keeping up.
That Liverpool badge looks strange
Van Dijk may be the only player that gets fifa ratings
When he said: Sturridge, when he's fit 😂
Liverpool fans are annoyed
His English is great 👍
He should have a better rating
much better than alli and so much humble
Seems like a nice guy
wonder why he said Sturridge
Sturridge wen his fit JUST COME TO LIVERPOOL VIRGIL VAN DIJK
Im surprised how good his english is
Haha he had to say Sturridge
I would personally like to see you allow the player to write his own stats before he sees what EA gave him. Spice things up a bit.
If he went liverpool he would have been a 85 for sure
His rating next year will skyrocket once he joins LFC
VVD knows. Fit Studge 🔥🔥
Everybody thinks they're better.
He said sturigge and Aguero because he wants to move to LFC and MC
Keep the footballers reacting to stats videos coming
Van Dijk come to Liverpool in January pleaseee 😭😭😭
Rio talking to a Loserpool player. Errrrr.... error 404!!! 😂😂😂\nRio talking to a Southampton player.*
He wants to go to either Liverpool or city
welcome to LFC in January.
He's got to come to Liverpool and save our defense
Just get to Liverpool
The thing is they need it to be a little balanced like 68 shooting wtf
He’s smoking, I’ll burn him
Sturridge when he's fit... He wants Liverpool so bad... And we want him likewise
83 is a joke hes at least 87
His card he wrote in would be worth 500k plus
What a tank in video game and real life
I think there's a mistake on the title he plays for Liverpool not Southampton c'mon get your act together
Big up the fs&hg tune
They don't give high pace to CB's to avoid them from being overpowered, annoying but whatever. Also, Dutch people have excellent English.
He's happy except from the badge on the card
They got the wrong team
How the hell does he have the same physique as Akinfenwa?...dont get me wrong, he is very strong but compared to Akinfenwa? No way..
Very good defender. Sturridge and Aguero do pull defenders away because they're always running at a different velocity. And of course VVD wants a move to either club so can't knock the brotha for saying that.
Would be the most used defender in the game
Should they put they're ratings in before you show them?
The stats are perfect but the passing is meant to be 72 or73
Lower the passing by 10 and pace by 5 he deserves an 84. Quality CB
I'd love to play a game against rio he seems like a sound guy and easy to get past
Rio tell him he will nothing if he moves to liverpook
Looks a little bit like Alli when he's laughing…
Wait those stats are wrong... it says 69 dribbling but he actually has 70 on Fifa 18
What are those cards made of always wondered
Van dijk and Keita for us next TW I hope.. Although Keita already signed for 2018 season
His english is better than rooney\n\n\n\n\nClassic😂
He wouldn't have those stats at Liverpool after conceding 50+ goals a year
Actually seems like a sound guy tbf
With lukaku
85 passing hahaha his funny
Free van dijk
85 passing cmon mate
Ferdinand son van dijk is gonna be great
❤❤❤
Please join liverpool
Did he say sturridge
Do one with Benjamin mendy
Sube el camino hijueputa
Plz upload these daily
Do one with kolasinic
he looks like offset from migos LOL
Greatest athlete YouTuber
Van dijk is the only CB that can save Liverpool tbh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again I love to see Liverpool suffer 😂
Este canal ya chafeo, solamente hablan del FIFA... ¿cuanto te pagaron los de EA, Rio?
He be a Liverpool player in January
Van Dijk Come to Liverpool
Van dijk should be higher in everything 😂
first
U didn't show him his bloody FIFA 18 card rio
I think Sturridge is better than Firmino when he isnt injured. Sturridge is actually great at football. But he really never gets play time either. Firmino was good like 1-2 seasons ago. But he havent rly done anything yet.
Wow Rio interviewing a Liverpool player now..oh wait..
What the... when did he ever face off against Studge?
The man, still miss him up in Glasgow one of the best players I've ever seen wear the hoops 🍀
Would be a good fit at United but put off with this whole liverpool link. Hope he shows a desire for united n something can happen. Always saw him as a perfect rio replacememt and an upgrade on smalling.
Guys I am from Holland van dijk Will never go to Liverpool he wants to go to Arsenal because of dutch players they had denis bergkamp,Marc overmars,Glenn helder
When is fifa 18 coming out
How can this man say sturridge is one of the hardest he has played against he literally had him in his pocket the hole match in the league cup
Rio wants to be having a little chat with VVD about a cheeky switch to Old Trafford.
Love this look!!
💪🏽
Lovinnnnng
BROWS YES
Wow!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
Getting ready for that 3mil giveaway
Yes yes yesss!
That higher brow really annoyed me 😩
*YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN That Dark LIPSTICK Plzzzz BELIEVE Me.*

I love watching your videos😭❤️ You're soo good at makeup and I love how you say wonder sayings at the end because it actually makes me feel special ❤️😭😭 Ilysm and keep up the good work💞
I love this look! Love that you did something bold, hope to see more of these looks!!
You are so beautiful, Christen! I love watching your tutorials and have learned so much! My makeup application skills have improved tremendously ❤️ So excited to recreate this look! Just purchased a vampy purple lipstick... Now to wait... 💄
This like it might be my favorite
So gorgeous 😍 I love it!! ⚰️🍷
HI CHRISTEN !!! ♥️ I recently seen your snaps and how your eyes been twitching, also how you said you had Bell’s palsy when you were 16, My mom she’s 31 yrs old and she had gotten Bell’s palsy when she was 10 and In January she came home from work and she felt numbness on the right side of her face and she went to the E.R. And found out she had Bell’s palsy. To treat her Bell’s palsy she went to acupuncture and physical therapy, and did facial exercises. Hopefully you don’t have it because you are the best person on YouTube I’ve seen doing makeup💕♥️ I hope I could help💯💕🤞🏼🙏🏼
Am only 11 and I have watched all of your videos. I love your channel so much
What's her foundation shade in that foundation 😭😭
In need of a new basic drugstore fall look!
In love with this look #flawless 😍😍😍😍😩

Probably one of my favourites of your looks! Thanks for giving us short and sweet tutorials 😋
I love you christen i am from lebanon and i liked all your videos befor watching it cz i know you are  perfect 😍😘😘❤
i like how you always cut yourself off in the middle of talking like you wanna tell yourself: shut up, Christen.
Love everything about this look! Fabulous! 😍😍😍
I'm stuck at home watching these vids...
Wow no highlighter? 😱 love you so much Christen!!! ❤️
You are so lucky. Meaning your god-given  features of very big eyes and huge lid space make application of make up ideal.  Also you quite smartly play up their size. It’s a gorgeous look and thank you for sharing it with us.
Christen, sorry to ask, but I die about your lips. Is all I can look at on your videos. Is that Volbela, Restalyne, or which one? I want to have mine done but had fillers somewhere else and didn’t go well. So, now I am scared. Hope you can share.
Where’s the shirt from😭
Love u girl so much don't change love ur personality
I love your lips so much!!
Do a peanut butter inspired look please
Also where is the top from? 😍
Bellaaaaa❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love love it looking like a twilight character 💕💕💕💕
Please do a hair tutorial!!!! 🙏😍
You're absolutely gorgeous but I say the same thing to myself every time I watch your videos.  It's always sloppy and slapped on.  Jaclyn hill would never slap on eye shadow like you do.  With you being so beautiful I really wish I could enjoy your videos but it just bugs me.
you are so close to 3 million subs😀
Dark lipstick is so underrated! It's so good I don't see why more people don't wear it.
Why do girls look like they haven't slept in years when they don't wear make up?
Love the hair \nCan u make a tutorial on how u styled it plz
Weird question, but why do they say snatch for contouring?
I clicked on this video because I loved her hair and while I loved the video I still don't know how to get this sexy haunting hair!!! By any chance does she have a tutorial up?
The makeup look is beautiful... but snatch is slang for pussy... please stop saying it!
I love watching your videos I wish I could pull off that lip color I love it. Would you do a video on how you fix your hair I got mine cut like that but can't get it fixed just right to suit me. Thank You and God Bless
You have made my day
Your beautiful Christen❤💖 love the way you are!
ugh sucks i cant use the tarte palette !!! i have it but when i use it i always end up with swollen eyelids :( looks like someone punched me in the eyes!!!
i'm so excited for Dominique beauty, and I love that gold on the waterline!
Can you pleasssssssse do a video about how styling your hair like that??? 😍😍😍
You're so pretty and very nice. You're perfect.
Those earrings. Does anyone know where they're from?
I really love your personality. I am a huge fan from the Philippines...lovelots
You sould take off the lash glue with some oil, that would melt the glue and you'll just have to clean. Ps: you can use any kind of oil even cooking oil 🤗🤗 lots of love from Paris 😘😘❤️❤️You rock !!
I wish I could wear make up. Women have an unfair advantage. This chick went from a 5 to a 9 just by covering her face. Im a solid 7 without make up, imagine if I could wear some make up.
She doesn't look vampy . She looks  nice . Pretty but I don't see vampy there at all .
I thought Photoshop illustrations take sometime but this proves me wrong.
New subscriber! Literally learned so much in one video wow..! 👏💅🏻🙏🏻
Raise your hand if you think she is the queen of asmr🙋🏾‍♂️
I would love to meet you in person
Can I meet you
i wish i was there i live near Disney
Hey so in your room tour you were petting your dog. I have never had so many tingles in my life so an entire video petting roscoe would be awesome
Man so sad literally there 5 days ago feels bad
You sound like my ELA teacher lol ....
Im going to Cali in 8 months can't wait
but Disneyland is the og theme park...
I was there just 2 weeks ago at the same place wtf XD
This was posted on my birthday! <333

Darling, come back to Florida and give us more amazing ASMR videos.
You remind me a lot of Pam from the office
I wonder if it's a callab 😄
Omg I live down the street 😩👌🏼
The fun is in your own projects Taylor; this old man Disney was a 33rd Mason, Club 33 who thought love relationships with kids in his double-life. Place is fun and innocent but with videos don't sell out or very least understand what this land of Disney conspires kids growing up on programs not parents like that. Really I'd just stay away from that part of the whole childhood.
I live about 30 minutes away from Disneyland I LOVE that place. Hope you have fun!
Crazy! I was at Disneyland that day too. I wonder if we crossed paths
She is more evil then I remembered I will have to terminate her😈 😉
Have fun DARLING  AND CONGRATS  ON YOUR PROJECT 🤗😎😉
I've never heard your real voice before (non-whispering)! It's nice. Can't wait for your next ASMR Video, Love you. 💖💖
Oml, her voice sounds so deap when she's actually speaking,  but when she whispers,  it sounds so light.
After your trip, do more ASMR roleplays!! Please!!
Is it weird hearing her not whisper? Lol
You should make a millatary
Aw I like your regular volume talking too, you have just a nice voice! I hope you have a blast in California and I can't wait for the secret project
I live in California! Los Angeles !
Why is everyone here so cringey
Is it just me or when you try to watch other ASMR videos it doesn't compare to Taylor's? -_-
So glad you're having fun
Omg, soo. I did see you... i thought it wasnt you, But it WAS... Woopsie dopsie
If I saw you at Disney land I wouldn't know wether to yell or whisper your name to get your attention
Oh sorry I forgot to add be safe!!! Enjoy ✌
Damn your ASMR voice is so different I feel like you're another person
When are you going to upload on your other channel?
Taylor, your voice sounds a bit like Taylor Swift.
I miss California. I lived there. But my step dad is a marine. So for now I'm in Massachusetts
One of them said that u have beautiful eyes and u do
Your non whispering voice/ real voice is really nice
Cool, im so jealous though! Nice to hear youre still gonna spoil us with this project thing going on. Excited about it all, cant wait for more :)) if you go on instagram look for bb8 adventure awakens i think you'd love to see it 👐👀💜
Cool! Can't wait for your video!
dang it i live like 45 minutes from Anaheim 😭

Well damn she sounds different when she isn't whispering. Idk how to feel
First: full brunette\nAfter: almost full blonde\n\nOmg will I be like that?\nNo I'm Asian\nMy hair is like black\nBlonde won't suit me\naaaaaaaaa
Ur voice is so pretty
Please do a magazine flipping and commenting ASMR video when you have the time..it was amazing in that hair styling video
You need to see the dentist about your central incisors there is shaded filling😂,,,good luck darling💗

I would like to be on the 27th October in Los Angeles to the LINKIN PARK show 😍❤\nBut this is not possible... 😔 This makes me very sad... 😢💔 I love Linkin Park!\nR.I.P Chester Bennington 💘\n\nStill, I wish you a lot of fun in California! ☀❤
I LOVE DISNEYLAND!!!!
Last time I saw you, you were at 200,000 HOWD YOU GROW SO QUICK??
Thank you Sony! Best usage of money I've seen spent in 2017. You could easily fund a season or feature length anime and it would print money. I can't wait to see the new movie in October!
Weyland, Yutani, Tyrell and Wallace.
Genialer Film, geniales Universum & sehr guter Tie-In. Freue mich riesig auf 2049!
This was superb! As I'd expect from the creator of COWBOY BEBOP. I love the cyberpunk theme. Can't wait for BR2049 and Cyberpunk 2077 from CD Projekt.
Excellent, they should do a full movie!
LOVE THIS! WE NEED A FULL ON MOVIE.
15 minutes..............I want more!!!! Superb!!!
How to get subtitles in English?
There's some nice call backs to the original film, like the noodle bar at 11:48 with the neon dragon sign where Deckard was eating at the beginning of the movie.
Now this is pretty cool!
Fanfkntastic !!! ....... I'd love to see THIS on the 'big screen' !!!
This is a masterpiece
What a tasty morsel!\n\nCross your fingers! My hope is that the anime master is up for The Animatrix Chronology and a story arc that spans nearly a thousand years.. that lead up to the 4th coming Matrix sequel that it draws from.
they should make this into a movie or a series
I expect nothing less from the director of cowboy bebop
our lord, the savior,deckard will save the world.
Good one)All praise to Denis and Co.
capto la esencia de  Blade Runner.
meh
Really awesome
9:06 Storm trooper accuracy.
MASTERFUL <3
Epico!!!!!!!!!
Meh.
That was awesome!! More more more!!
superb....keep this going!!!!
Brilliant work.
Wonderful 👏
3:30 David Bautista
... Bravo!...
thank you
Amazing
So, why not just do the 9th Star Wars film like this?
I don't like the song of the credits, too much pop.
Great drawings but I feels like too pathetic for that girl fellow. Her poor acting made me uncomfortable to watch this movie.
that's shit. Disliked.
if the new movie is even half as good as this, we're gonna be in for something breathtaking
Better 3d effects in a anime than the new berserker
LOL - So Blade Runner is doing exactly the same thing that the Matrix did with the Animatrix - small vignette animation to fill in the timeline - and they end up pretty much the same plot point. Thank you for destroying my hopes for 2049 with the dated supremacist vibes.. and the jihadi nexus doesn't get blown up by the explosion?
Love the intro hello everyone i'm in a field 😂😂 YAY BANDS BACK TOGETHER
YouTube boy band please
I’m joe at 5:16. Everyone’s in a group then there’s joe on his own awkwardly standing 😂😂

So glad everyone is back together again! 😢😄😙❤
I don't know why, but jim reminds me so much of dad😂?

Why isn't Tanya going to be there?
That’s a beautiful VW Camper😍
How come his views are low :/ x
I loved this, I miss your vlogs!
I'm fairly sure the campervan in HTR wasn't left hand drive. It also had the newer style white/yellow registration whereas this one had the pre-1973 style black back with white print. \n\nCool vlog.
The special guest that's top secret that's in one of the last clips ;) hahaha
TOM DALEY WAS THERE OH MY 😍

3rd comment
Does this mean Marcus is finally being normal again?? (I unwatched him after the break up and acting like a shit.) :/
I don't get how Jim acts like he and Louise are awesome friends when him and Tanya didn't invite her to their wedding but htey invited Hannah Hart. Jim did a radio show with Louise so you think that they would be better friends than Hannah.
IS TOM DALEY THE ONE AT 5.01?????
Has anyone else noticed that naomi has just disappeared from the group
This is such a beautiful look!
Oh yeah! Because it's so popular , they never stop and tell people that the Tatcha Dewy Mist has 20 different botanical oils in it. It's all part of moisture for dryness. We played with it at work and I like it , but i'm oily. It's for if your make up is all done and you want the look of a highlight and a DEWY finish ! lol learned looking like a needed 5 packs of oil blotting sheets!! it's lovely on bare skin though! I looove Tatcha Enzyme Rice!!
why is she wearing two blouses at the same time? i see the green blouse under
I still feel that the subculture pallete is patchy 🤷🏾‍♀️
So gorgeous!!! You're the only person I trust when you talk about products you love/ don't love. You've helped me so much with not wasting my time on products that don't work!!! Xox
Had I tried doing this makeup look, I would have failed... miserably. She makes it look so easy lol 😭
Ugh I wish u were dropping the clothing line sooner! My birthday is coming up oct. 15th and I know I'll want something to wear from the line:((
Omg I thought I was the only person on the planet that HATES the Tatcha spray!!! It makes me look like a bucket of grease and I don't even have oily skin at all
Can you do more looks with your pallete please
Can you do a burgundy color?
This makeup looks really nice and for some reason makes you look a bit older. Can you do a super sensitive skin care routine?
Two ships passing in the night
Clean and clear persagel dries up my acne over night! It’s awesome
I just bought your palette from Ulta! I was so excited to see it there! Can you please make videos specifically using your palette only? I normally never wear eyeshadow. So I'm trying something new and would love to see more looks with your palette. :) Thank you and love your videos! They inspre me to try new looks and play around with make-up more. haha
IS Clinical Active Serum cleared all my acne
Can you do a purple eye look next?? :)
hi guys! just made my first video would really appreciate it if you guys checked it out! :D
Lerosett by Gunilla of Sweden! It's a clay mask and spot treatment. It's the best product for breakouts hands down. 👍
Could you do a nice violet purple look? I would appreciate it. Thank you❣
can you please do a purple look💜
Btw i adore this eye look on you and in general! ♡♡♡♡
Do a rainbow eye look next!!
I really like the ren clear calm line for breakouts! M-61 also has a good spot treatment
Can you do something with dark blue please! Thank you!
The La-Roshe Posay Effaclar line is the BEST for acne/sudden breakouts! Effaclar duo is the greatest spot treatment I've ever used. You can get it at Walgreens or Target!
I like the eyes so pretty  I have brown eyes will those colors  make them pop or clash.
Please do a yellow eyeshadow look ;)
Coconut and honey!!!!!! The absolute best for acne and completely natural!
Your are great Make-up teacher and gorgeous too.
I'm very acne prone due to my oily skin! One of the products I use are the tea tree toner from Lush, and I really think it helps :) most tea tree items are meant to help with acne
Oh wow! I just LOVE your eye makeup!! Gorgeous!!
I love you boo. Going back to natural and I love it. 😍😍
Does anyone know if she’s done a tutorial with the Jaclyn hill pallet??? 😁
Nose job?? Why?? Carli this is you, a nose job would make you look different, like you are being someone you are not. I don't know if it makes sense but be proud of your natural features, you don't need it I think... and that's not only me, I am sure everyone here thinks your nose is beautiful, it is like your own trademark and we all accept you the way you show yourself since your channel started. Please stay as you are! *Do not become a stranger* xx
I love how you understand how to use powdery eyeshadows! 😍😃 So many people dig their brushes in and keep dipping, loading up their brushes, and then complain about so much product on the brush and fall out?!
I love these type of videos bc I watch them while I’m doing my makeup and it’s just a part with me and my computer aka you lol
I am so in love with you Carli you inspire me so much my dad committed suicide a few weeks ago and just  watching your video's makes me have hope that things will get better your a true Angel x
You should do a hair tutorial video as well as skinn care!! I love that braid!! Thank youuuuuu
Would love to see a burgundy or pink eye look <3
Eh. I could skip this one 😩 It's so not me. I love your neutrals personally.
My 3 year old LOOVVEES your kitty cat ears : )
Ur so perfect carli!!!
Purple ? Or ruby ? Cranberry? Blue
👍
Gorgeous as always 😘
Everyday natural makeup ☺️
Gril fanish see you freshman option
PINNK
PURPLE!!!
you're beautiful carli, inside and out💙
Something is different. Your jawline is skinnier than before. Did you lose weight or have surgery? Hope you have been doing well. Very beautiful as always Carli😍💕
Where is Brett these days???
I’d love to see a fall eye look but using your own palette
Very beautiful, but the foundation is too dark ,
Peter Thomas Roth clearing gel (use it at night, wake up a seriously happy camper) and Sunday Riley Luna sleeping oil (the retinoids help with the spots left behind post breakout). Remember to patch test 😘
I love purple eyeshadow looks if you don't mind doing a very vibrant purple look that be grateful and awesome or maybe a whatever you want maybe a fun bright color I like fun colors neutrals anything is great to me but I'm obsessed with purple the color you got on foiled gold and looks Etc
I wouldn't use acne product if you already have pretty good skin like you said. Why add the chemicals when you can likely correct with skincare and drinking more water?
CARLI BYBEL - I've asked before, but if you have some amzing tios for people with heart shaped faces - PLEASE TELL ALL 🌟💎🌺💄😇
Thought this said deep chit chat and I was like yesssssss deep talks! Share with us your wisdom. But this deep teal is beautiful! My birthday party is tonight so I'm gonna try this hopefully it doesn't turn out cray. 😰
Hi! Love allll your vids! The tatcha mist isn't a setting spray! Use it before hand and it'll do the trick for sure! But definitely doesn't work as a setting spray! Or it's good for the no make up- makeup days! 💗💗 obsessed with ya!
I thought you had already done your brows before the video. 😂 their soooooo good!
Can you do a burgundy colour! ☺️☺️❤️
The lighting is to dark
Do a barbie pink girly flirtatious type look with like a hot pink lip. Don't think i've seen you do that before.
I’d love to see like a browny-pinky subtle smoky eye tutorial soon!
Do a darrrk brown!!! Or grey!
I use Origins super spot remover for blemishes, just a tiny dab.
Love your videos u are definitely one of my favorite youtubers ❤️❤️❤️
Maybe an everyday deep purple fall look! If that makes sense lol <333
That Kryolan Setting Powder look so intriguing! Has anyone else tried this?\n~Gloss and Sparkle
Any noxzema product get it at target!
cant wait for the skin care vid!!
This was an awesome detailed tutorial. Love this video. Especially the eye details.
Carli I recommend you to use “Kate Somerville Acne Treatment” it’s a acne spot treatment that you can put on over night. This works girl! It’s available at Sephora(:💕💕
What setting powder / baking powder is she using
Tea tree oil by the body shop is amazing for breakouts
I personally think you are absolutely beautiful the way you are, but it’s your body and you should do whatever makes your heart happy. ❤️
carli.. do a different look with a different lip shade.. like a purple lip look... or even a metallic lip color with fall eyeshadow colors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved the video, two thumbs up. Can you please make sure your clothing line doesn't go out of stock too soon? Xoxo
pleaseeeee tell me you'll be doing another Birthday Makeup video when the time comes
try aloe vera gel. its the best for  breakouts. I had acne for years and after I started using this, my skin cleared up completely ❤ love u ❤
Phenomenal love!!!!! So excited for your fall line!!!!
Would love to see a cranberry/ violet fall makeup look❤️🍂
So pretty!  I love your tutorials!!
yellow <3<3 such a trend
Thanks for all your tips, Carli!!!  You're so sweet!!!!
The makeup with your dress looks amazing!!
I would love you to do a a make-up look using those weird colors that come in eye shadow pallets. Blues, Yellows, etc.
tea tree oil kills pimples overnight and it doesn't interfere with my night products, just apply it last on top on any pimple or any spot you feel one coming, it works wonders!
You're so amazing. Loved you from the start. Keep putting good into the world beautiful girl ❤️💛💚💙💜
Gorgeous ❤️
Purple/Mauve look would be amazingggggg😍😍😍😍
Stemulations rescue repair. 8% lactic acid. Changed my life and skin. Licensed Esthetician here 👋🏼💋

JACKIE JACKIE JACKIE JACKIE JACKIE, JACKIE JACKIE JACKIEEEE
it‘ really interesting watching your morning & hair routine but....when do have breakfast??
I have straight hair I don't even know why am watching it 😹\n I love you Jackie 💋💋❤️❤️
I LOVE your natural hair!
Yaaaaaasssss I feel u!!! With the Fenty in the back!!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💃🏾💃🏾
I hate her blonde hair! No just no black is better with her complexion
I love your natural hair! ❤️
This video made me buy two of those bonnets lol. XL. My hair laughs at the drugstore bonnets.
The satisfaction I get from watching a black woman work through her kinky curly hair on wash day is unprecedented. Everyone's on that crunchy slime and I'm over here like give me three layers of conditioner and a hair mask!! It's really kinda creepy tbh but I just don't think about it too much...
Jackie i love u sm that i watched a whole 18 minutes of your washing yo hair
I love your natural hair!!!!
I don’t have hair like this, but I enjoyed watching this for your personality😂 laughing throughout the whole thing
I am so in love with your natural hair!
Have you ever straightened your hair so you know the true length?
Your hair looks very good! i understand where you are coming from. I Thank GOD!!! i  finally have gotten to a point where I am comfortable with my natural wash and go..it works for me..and i aint changing until im good and ready...
I wish my hair could do wash and go's.
I actually really like the way your brows look using that brow pencil!
I LOVE your hair!
Awesome video Jackie!!! Can I ask where did u get the top you're wearing? 😍
You got me singing you new theme song in the middle of the grocery store. Lol
Girl u know it, thanks for rambling 😘😘
You hair is do beautifulllllllll jheeeezzzzz
Sell your little brother 😂😂😭 but that whole brand DOES smell like cookies 😭❤️❤️❤️
Are you a licensed cosmetologist?
I'm happy to see your natural hair I love it.
Yes girl come all the way through 😍
I'm surprised that you don't wash out ur conditioner, didn't know you can do that because I always rinsed it out after deep conditioning
Your hair is beautiful
No. No on this blonde hair girl. I love you girl, but NO.
Love you start! So funny !💖💯
Your hair is so beautiful 😍
Highlight of video: 5:01-5:09. You're killing me Jackie!
I’m here for\nThe new theme somg😍😍😍😩
Why do I feel like you've threatened to sell your brother before 😂😂😂
Well damn do you have a video on how u put the ombre affect dyes in your hair ? Looks so nice
The texture looks very unique...
I love love your hair texture
Hey if you do have a routine or maintenance for your backache could you do a video? I suffer from it as well and would value your opinions and methods to keep it at bay. Also how do you deal with the hyperpegmentaion?
Ive been waiting on this video!! I LOVE your natural hair!!
Overe here with SERIOUS hair envy.  Might or might not have tried this this am, but my junk looked like squirrels and cats had be licking in it 😑.  Gorgeous tresses, J.
The last part of the video tho. I have hella long natural hair even with shrinkage so people ask me on a daily when I'm going to straighten my hair or say ish like I bet your hair would be beautiful straighten..... Um bitch it's beautiful not straighten so what the hell you trying to say 😒.  I will be 5 years no heat July 2018 and I always said I would straighten when I hit five years no heat but I doubt I will because I'm not interested in my hair being straight. I think the only heat my hair will ever get is the heat from the sun, water and the heat my body naturally produce. Who knows one day I might change my mind because I have been interested in a hooded dryer for a while now.
I live my curls and I think that they’re beautiful I can look at them and acknowledge that it’s beautiful but the thing is I feel like it doesn’t suit me and I get really depressed with it natural and I’ve straightened for years I love curly hair I think it’s beautiful and I love it on others but yeah I don’t know what’s wrong with me you look beautiful with your natural hair btw Jackie❤️❤️
Jackie Ii'm thinking of going blonde too and I've done a ton of research but still dont know how... please leave me a tip please thankyou
U got det good hair. Them the curls u find at the beauty store in the hood
Looking like one of the gross sisters 😂😂😂
I wish I had your hair. It is gorgeous!😍😍😍😍
Sell your lil brother on Ebay DEAD
This intro/ theme song. 😂😂😂 I love it.
Such an ethereal beauty. a goddess
My mom wants to know if you've tried Jane Carter? She loves you by the way. I turned her onto you and she's hooked. 😁😁
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! Your hair is BOMB! Wish my wash and go's would do like this lol
Good this motivates me to go take a shower haven’t done that in a few weeks
My natural hair does not take requests we need this on a shirt please! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
You should try (If you haven't already) Aussie 3x moisture conditioner. Its oh-so-hydrating!
Love the wash and go. The blonde looks vibrant, and your hair is long!  Loving that gloss too.
Hair looks great! I feel like that's a lot of products on your face... Sometimes simple is better. But taking care and spoiling your skin is always a plus!
Love your energy dear keep up the good work, love the hair as well☺️
That was a tight video, Jackie, and I liked it.
Your hair looks BOMB, Jackie! I'm missing my blonde now lol
Jackie your hair is so pretty
Amazing 😇 I just washed my hair but now I feel the urge to go do it again 😂
I've never seen a hair texture like that. Like it seems like it's 4a or b but every single one of your curls are defined with no frizz. I'm 3b but even my shit has tons of frizz and gets dry and matted after a few days
I have DIY my hair for years! I'm surprised it was never green!! 😂😂😂😂 Now, I do have unusual hair...it does NOT fall out & I'm not pressed if it falls out. BUT she right, see a professional LICENSED stylist. My hair and your look about the same texture. Looove your hair & I live for kinky Kurly products! ❤️❤️❤️
Can you please do a review of some the products that are on the best of Allure 2017 list. Please!
Her hair is so satisfying to look at lol
She said the mask smells like resurrection 😂. I can't see my natural hair ever looking this good. Those curls girllll💕
Not to be one of thoooooose, but I'd be so curious to see you hair straightened just because of the way you have it colored. Sooo if ever YOU decide to for whatever reason, I wouldn't be mad at you if you decided to post of vid of it, lol js. But even if you don't you're hair is lovely, girl, and I totally get the whole braidout/twistout/bantu knot out not working. I honestly don't even try to style my hair because the SHIT DON'T WORK FOR ME 😭Thanks for sharing with us!!
Thanks Jacky! my daughter has curly hair and I don't know what to do with all the frizz, now I do. 😉
Your hair is so beautiful! 💕
Yessss, the Butter Me Up Goods Golden Temple Mask is AMAZING!!! I got it right before they discontinued it for the season. Sidenote: They're bringing it back next summer.
I could watch you all day!!! Gonna try this hair routine because your hair is too popping!😍😍😍
Your natural hair gives me life. Its so cuuute
I used to feel like I had to do all the styles that everyone else did, I used to do twist outs and stuff, they worked but they were too much work. I'd rather just get in the shower rinse/wash my hair and throw some conditioner in it and go on bout my business. Takes me 20-30 mins (with my actual shower time) compared to an hour
Your natural hair is NOT boring! It's beautiful!!!
That intro tho...lol
beautiful hair wow
They look like ramen noodles 😐
LMAO you too funny though
girl how yo eyelashes lookin perfectly groomed and poppin in the damn shower
It smells like cookies, miracles, resurrection 😂😂😂
Bleaching your hair loosens your texture I've noticed. Deff gonna bleach at some point, haha
come thru ramen noodles
#THATNAME
Love this video!!!
We are snooze twins.
Natural coils are poppin'.  Nice.
Want your hair so badly. !
AHHHH CEDRIC
Goldie locks who?, she retired...
does bleaching your hair hurt it??
Thanks
Yassss jackie I love your curl patern😍😍😍
Love your hair 😍
i love your natural hair!! gorgeous!
sooooooo cute
Gasp! I have blonde hair too!
Love your hair! Too cute. #teamnatural
Yesssssssszzs👍👍👍👍love the video 💃🏻💃🏻
Your hairs so nice
yasss auntieeeeeee!
This was scripted. At 2:50 while they was dragging Enzo into the corner, Enzo lifted his knee up to get into the corner. The WWE are doing this to promote the cruiserweight divison. They are using Enzo as a way to bring the entertainment back into the cruiserweight division. That is probably why they had all the cruiserweights came into the ring to put on a show. Is it true that the WWE is really getting rid of the cruiserweight division?
Y did they do ton enzo and where was his biggest enemy NEVILE
At least WWE was listening to the comments when we said “send Braun Strowman to 205 Live” 😂
2:29\n Stop it! I can't see nothing.
Hahahaha savage Enzo amore got what he deserved no one will save him Enzo look who's tough now buddy
U guys hating on this segment are totally marking out. It’s working. This should’ve been on tv. Enzo is a hell of a seller I’ll say that.
I thought cedrik Alexander,rich swann and taxes are good
Enzo is a joke now
It seems nearly 3M viewers loved to see Enzo destroyed.
Question.  What's Braun Strowman got to do on the Cruiserweight division scene?  Just your resident madman in the house?
Wow I never knew Braun celebrated the holiday of giving
The best moment on Raw.
Well enzo as much as i like u never piss of the divison by mocking them like how u did with gallagher rich swan gran mataliek etc and no wonder they wanted to beat u up also it wasn't rlly a suprise that nevile wanted to kick your butt after no mercy
The cruiserweights are literally dwarves next to braun
I don't think the cruiser weights don't like Enzo a more at all
It would've been more entertaining to watch Braun Strowman just destroy a bunch of Cruiserweights.
What happened to BA*
Every single cruiserweight will always be a face to me after this because they looked like they were all getting along and they got the crowd involved attacked Enzo
Let me throw some punches and kicks in too 👊👊👊👊
There was nothing fake about that knee @ 3:00
Very bad all are beating to enzo
I wish Carmella saves to manage Enzo & have Cass  return  save Enzo 2nd reform it.
For the Watch
Braun Strowman is such a gentleman. Letting the whole crusiserweight divison beat Enzo Amore. Lol
poor enzo
This reminds me of attack on titan when the ape titan let's the little titans eat miche
Mampus
Who got what he deserved
There gonna kill him..
They should make a new nexus
How to make a whole division look like a joke *slow clap*
1:47 check out the blatant audio overdubbing. C'mon WWE, that's just silly.
they trying to end homie career
I want to kill Braden stromen
way they attack Enzo Amore?!
This is so satisfying.
U DESERVED IT !!!
He could running powerslam all of the at the same time if he wanted to
Hey!!!!!! Why whit Enzo so Enzo is good and crushwaight shmash Enzo why it s his first champ !!!! Why good why 😯😯😯😯😯 so whit enzo! It's fair braun and crusiwaight hate enzo why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😣😣😣😣😣😔😔😔😔😔😓😓😓☹😟😤 but next week I say good look for enzo!
This reminds me when the Nexus assaulted Cena back in 2010 without tearing the ring up.
Enzo Amore runs his mouth too much that's why the Cruiser weight don't like him.
Damn Eric. You just got buried for being you.
Who's theme was at the end
I love you john cena
i have never seen a man take so many finishing moves
Whole cruseweight got all our eyes on them because of enzo
Whose #1 contender now? All the cruiserweights hit him
4:20 \nRef: you good Enzo?\nEnzo: yep
Enzo is not good wwe superstar
The wwe anti bullying campaign at it's best. Wonderful marketing.
Reminds me of the Nexus...
Did Strowman come out after raw ended that night?
U cruiserweight i wish to beat u
Enzo just runs his mouth too much \nDisrespecting the 205 divison......he low blowed Neville......He should get a rematch against Enzo....because Neville is the true champion
If u want awsome truth to reunite to fight these little jimmies give me a hell ya
This is for his horrendous attitude backstage
I think that in TLC would be a lumberjack match for the wwe cruiserweights championship
really need to remove 205 its terrible. Raw needs more back stage stuff. Like back when stone Cold was around.
Stupid Braun Strowman has to come after Enzo because he knows that he can't beat anyone half his size, and BTW, is Enzo now the only face in the Cruiserweight division, because that's just sad.
I love the happy endings
They added crowd sound effects during Brian Kendrick's spin move
Loving that fake crowd noise while Kendrick spun him around...
Enzo deserved it it from the beginning
Who's the guy in the suit? The commissioner or something?
Man there are plenty of snowflakes in the comments! SUCK IT UP ENZO SUCKS!
So Enzo is a heel and Braun and Neville are faces......right?
Enzo is the strongest and powerful in wwe
Welp,looks like Enzo's gonna be the longest reigning Cruiserweight Champion
This beaten should happen to the miz
Anyone notice Braun told them to come to the ring haha
THE BEST DAMN WWE 2K17 Universe Mode!!!: https://t.co/i3ayU4Jni3 https://t.co/dK4fWfR4r8
Possible heel turn by Enzo considering everyone hate him now
Enzo pissed somebody off backstage to be getting this kind of punishment.
Genocide
450 splash
The knew 205 champion... brauuuuuun
My turn
Why???????????????
The Cruiserweight Nexus
Why so mean to Enzo Amore
Poor Enzo
Wtf. No Detonation Kick!!
very good very good boys.
Fake sounds coming when Brian Kendrick spins Enzo amore.
Strowman joining cruzerwieght
Gulak lol
Look at divari 4:40-4:43
Hey yo Enzo\nhttps://youtu.be/5ZduY8nCSXM
Thats bullying
I don't understand wwe anymore, smh
#pushDrewGulak
This is stupid
Braun should be wwe champion
WTF
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w2oGRckzYlk
😂😂😂😂😂
AWESOME!!!
Whole 205 Live become Heel at same time 😈
Poor enzo.
Cass return ????
Steve and Nancy are a beautiful couple!  And he even helped them in the end against the monster..
Since this footage was shot on red, I think the footage was ran through a vhs cassette to make it look more 80s and 90s style with the music.
DUDE IM SO HYPE FOR THIS! YAY WOOOEEEHHH!! I HAVE WAITED FOR 5 MONTHHHHSS! When is it coming out?!
This is not stranger things.. is this trailer a joke about the show? Wtf
Some people's OTP is Mileven or Jancy. But the ultimate couple by far is DEMOPAPA
I ship the three of them lmao
What day does it release?
I miss mileven give me some mileven \n\n\nI’ll pay you
I love this kinda throwback trailers with this 80s vibe. Good job Netflix, you really put me in your 80s STRANGER vibe.
That triangle tho and rip best friend
So is Jancy happening or what..... PLEASE
wow netflix is really coming though with the ships
Honestly - Bless you for making this. Can't wait to see their relationship blossom in season two!
Netflix is messing with my poor Stancy obsessed heart.
Nancy and Jonathan Here!!
Wait, did Netflix just make a fan video of their own show???
Can we please get a version of the show in this filter!??? Make it happen Netflix.
This came out 1year ago and I still haven't watched it.
Let's face it, what we all really wanna focus on is eleven and mike's romance in this season/show.
If nancy and johnathon get together il kill myself cya
I ship Nancy and Eleven 😊
Is it just me or the one that Elle Mills made was so much better
Like So 80s Man. Can we call it Strange Love???\nAny way the trailer Rocks and one more month left for Season 2!!!
These characters are my favorite part of Stranger Things. Just set this to some 80's music - Tears for Fears or something. :)
Come on October 27th. I can't wait to watch one of my favorite Netflix shows
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A HINT THAT THE LOVE TRIANGLE GETS REAL NEXT SEASON. Because Hopper and Joyce is where the real action is. damn.
*Beginning: He was a jerk.* \n*Ending: He was my favorite supporting cast.*
Lmaoo at 0:12 who thought that was Barbra?
i think the fuck not
Why this doesnt even have new footage!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They should do the entire second season with these VHS effects
When does season 2 come out?
imagine thinking this is true. Jancy 4 life.
Okay this video is great but wtf is the thumbnail? 😂😂
i just hope they don't make nancy and jonathan a thing. 😕\ni was so glad this show didn't follow that girl-dates-a-popular-guy-but-suddenly-she-fallsinlove-with-that-weird-guy overused plot.
???????? What the hell is this shit??????
I am so weak for this <3 Netflix ships it!!
Why did this make me cry
This is probably Netflix's best series of all time. All time!
JANCY JUST GOT A NEW SHOW. AWESOME
I'm a smidge a creep and a perv, and he even freaks me out; but, I am the goofy lovable perv.
so ready to see barb back on the stream :)
Mike: What was your test on? Human anatomy?\n\nMe: SHOTS FIRED OHHHH CRAP DANG OHMAGAWD FIRE ALARMS GO OFF
This was so so so so cute!!!! Loved it!❤️❤️❤️
NANCY AND JOHN SHOULD OF GOT TOGETHER! STILL PISSED 😡 😤
Netflix when is the 13 reasons why season 2 coming??!😅😅😅
Feels like a John Hughes movie.
>-< I thought this was another trailer XD
Nancy belongs with Johnathan not Steve, bottom line cut and fucking dry
The funny thing is, of this was an actual trailer, I would never watch it. But I love it in Stranger Things. I think it's because the rest of the show provides enough that I can avoid thinking about the romance when I need to.
Anyone who hasn't seen Stranger things and you don't like spoilers please don't watch this, it's not a trailer. It shows basically all of the scenes haha
Johnathans my fav i love him so much
JANCY IS MY FAVE! And can't wait to see them in S2
The power of editing lol
why did I watch Barb asking Nancy a question and think this was a season 2 trailer when I know that barb is dead?
God bless you Netflix for making this happen for me
I still think Nancy should have broken up with Steve and gotten together with johnathan but NOOOO. (At lest Steve saved their lives when the demagorgon almost freaking killed them)
Now do Mike and Eleven.
This show isn't a ROMANTIC SHOW
Plot twist- Steve and Jonathan  love each other
I think love just got stranger!
I don't know about anyone else, but I kept being distracted by Steve's hair, thinking how could she let that get close to her.
Can NOT WAIT!!! I’m in the upside down!!! 🙃😍😍😍🙌🔥❤️☺️😘😇😈😉 xxx
Anyone know what the music is?
This is great. I want this to be a cheesy 80s movie now.
I thought the way Steve attacked the Demogorgon with a bat was awesome but I'm with Team Jonathan.
That would be the worst thing ever.
I NEED IT TO BE OCTOBER 27TH.
#jancy ALL the way😊❤️
I'M A JANCY SHIPER!
Netflix, are you SHIPPING THEM?
DONT FORGET ABOUT BARB
Jancy is life
AE COLORING
👏👏👏that was great
I THINK TF NOT AGHHHH
WAHHHHH IM SCREAMING 😍😍
WTF THIS WAS SO PERFECT
Hello yes
HYPE
This is so CUUUTE!
Team Steve!
Lol
This is so hype
OMFG MY JANCY HEART
NANCY AND JONATHON !!
when netflix deadass ships jancy
justice for barb
I ship Jancy sooo freaking much!!!!
Fuck Steve.
stupid VHS filter
One Tree Hill
AWHHHH STOP.
*Jonathan or Steve? Nancy 😍*
Johnathan deserves someone better~
this is like one of those romance movies from back in the day
Goodnesss I LOVE Johnathon soooooooo much!!!!! Like I can’t I just can’t he is sooooooo ADORABLE
Jonathan and Nancy would be such a cliché couple but I ship it so much
Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nI thought this clickbait shit was a trailer\nAnd so did you
*I love how everybody is involved in Will's missing but nobody gives a fuck about Barb*

Louis you're my fucking hero! I spilled a full glas of red vine over my 1 week old macbook pro (late 2013 bought it 2nd hand). i was frustrating and hated myself. you gave me confidence so i decided to open it up and repair it on my own. it was completly dead (even no light on the charger). i renew all damaged connections... some pins even vaporized when i heated them up because of the acid from the vine. i was lucky that i didn't need to buy any new components. i want to thank you for motivating people to do those repairs on their own, and you do well in showing that your skills are not special, actually everyone can do it with some practice. the microscope aswell the ultra sonic cleaner on my working place helped a lot of course... keep moving on - your repair videos are just fucking hilarious, i had to laugh a lot while i was realising i potentially lost 1000$. lots greetings from germany :)))) this message has been written on a water damaged macbook pro
All of NYC is a funnel going down the drain.
Congratulations on trending on YouTube!
If you want to pay 15 dollars for a fix. This is what you deserve.
Well Louis being that this is window Air Conditioner unit \nCause 1: Clogged Condensate Drain Line\nCause 2: Damaged/Rusted Drain Pan\nCause 3: Broken Condensate pump\nCause 4: Dirty Air Filter\nCause 5: Low Refrigerant\nCause 6: Excessive Pressure (Dirty Condenser/Evaporator Fins) \nCause 7: Frozen Evaporator Coil\nWhen was it last full maintenance cleaning schedule done 10 years age? LoL
hahahaha... Louis, that was so funny!
Wow, just wow no other words.
Looks fixed to me.  I love NY
As a contractor from washington, this makes me sad...
That was pretty creative not going to lie.
From the A.C....to the wall...till the ac drips down my ballz..ooo these contractors foul.
Crazy. They couldn’t even bother to use duct tape!! 😂
That ac is in a shitty location and a window unit to boot. Cant place a condensation line cuz it located above the entrance. Someone will sue you for slipping on the water on sidewalk.
who puts an air conditioner above a door? that's my question. looks like a safety hazard without angle brackets.\nplus it has to drip somewhere.. on customers? guess that's the city for ya!
Correction, that is not duct tape. It is a high tech polymer film used by NASA to control the international space station's water leaks. So it should be good enough for New Yorkers 👽
Sounds like you need an appliance repair person. Not a contractor......
Looks like something a Mexican would have done,you know those brilliant border jumpers we must have here because of their talents
Well you cheap bastard , shouldn't gone with a licensed contractor!
I would of attatched a tray to the bottom of the unit, with a pvc connector funneling the water to a pipe running down the wall to the sidewalk. Itd work and look much better!
Well, I guess those claims that Trump didn't pay contractors might be for crap like that then
holy shit\ni should move over there if contractors over there are so shit lol\ni couod do good just by being able to do a normal job lol
please, save your money next time and buy yourself a better camera
You're telling me you don't have a spare iPhone to record this with, Louis? Yeesh...
This guy sounds like he should be eating a calzone and grabbing his vick
That's highly unacceptable.
Did the video quality go from ok to potato for anyone else? Looks like minecraft
Didn't they show you the repair before they left ? Not all contractors are the same. Just do your homework next time on the guy you decide to hire. Be responsible and you will have better results.
How did an unedited video make it on trending?
Who was the worker? I have work for him
Why would you call a contractor for a window unit ??
I guess you don't take Uber then.
The unit isn't exactly leaking per se, its just hot and humid outside so water is accumulating on the evaporator coil. Looks like that is a packaged window AC which are intentionally slanted to the outside for drainage, rather than running a condensate drain line. Looks like whoever you hired, installed a piece of shit condensate line. The condensate drain can be done cheaply with soldered copper.  I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400. Also, get a quote with a scope of work you both can sign off on, that way you can hold them to a copper line for instance, rather than taped tubes or whatever this guy used. Be specific on the route you want him to run.
What are you talking about? That's exactly how I'd do it.
Did you get an AC repair guy? Because at that point, you're better off buying a new one
I love Donald J Trump!!!
Ah so that's why trump did pay his contractors
Please buy a new camera
I know my father is a contractor... works under a millionaire... and heck I know he would probably bitch slap that other contractor...
Be a man, and fix the damn thing yourself! Jesus, do you also pay a mechanic to put washer fluid in your car too?
That's why I hate the city.
You would have to pay if it was duck tape.
This is why Trump wanted mexicans to build the wall
New York, America's shit hole :)
The reason i dont pay contractors is because im broke
Best I can do is 25¢
Looks like fake. However anything can be spected. That work deserves a big facepalm( and to look for the 4chan's cams).
So how come you didn't fix it yourself
Something tells me this guy did not call an actual contractor. He probably called an unlicensed handyman because he didn't want to pay for an actual tradesman to come out and do the work. At least I hope that's the case.
Congrats on getting on Trending. I’ve been watching you since you were at around 25000 subscribers. Keep up the good work!
I would hand them the traditional payments of my people. A banana shoved into a pile of my own shit. There is nothing more sacred than this as payment for good deeds.
Probably be easier to just get waterproof duct tape and tape the leak
cheap, fast, and good. Can't have all three .
Russian Hack, we call it in Germany =)
Contractor was dumb ass you can't fix that.
Oh yes...this only happens in NYC.
Put your contractor on blast!!!
You New Yorkers have the coolest accent in America.
I'm from PA and see this in the warehouse I work in... lol
*watches one DIY video on YouTube*\n\nI think I could start my own business now!
If it is stupid and it works, it ain't stupid.
You know... this is the second time (by my count) that you've made the front of Digg?  That's rather impressive I think!

It just lacked someone to inspect or did the quality check on the workmanship.  If the contractor did not provide the QA person then the client should do the inspecting for a sign off.
Take that tube thing and shove it real hard in that contractor's poop shooter. It needs to be wrecked like what I just saw of his doing to your letters. No consideration whatsoever. You walk pass your store door and condensation better not drop on your balls instead go balls deep up his. I hired contractor and he started wrecking the neighbors stuff and here I am finding out he's fixing this wreck on my watch and taking over two hours to do it.
There's no way ANY self respecting HVAC tech would do that. You must of hired someone from Backpage or Craigslist. If you were looking for a quick fix,  they sell plastic clip on fittings for the bottoms of some brands of window AC's to redirect the condensate. Worst case scenario, I would of threaded in a brass male threaded adapter to 1/2 inch pex fitting (depending on the diameter of the hole the water is dripping from. Then slide some vinyl tubing over it, securing the tubing in a corner with a few 3/8 inch tubing clamps. $95
What kind of (insert politically correct word for retard here) would cone up with this, then try and charge money for it?  I'd do better than that for free!
I think the tubes too short!   Let's call it 'Art'?  or how to read a Mans Mind!
Jokes on him, the AC is supposed to leak from there.
I'm not sure what else could be done. AC pulls moisture out of the air, and this particular type of unit releases the moisture out of the back. Some allow you to hook a hose, but that water does have to go somewhere. Many have no connection port as the water is condensed onto the coils and just drops out of the back.
You look like you need some fucking sleep bro
Why in the hell would you put a condensing unit above the front door of your establishment? It's called a Condensing Unit for a reason....it produces water from the heat and humidity in the air! OMG!!! Spoiled city slickers!
Nobody cares if your a real New Yorker
Don't air conditioners always leak water alittle bit?
Fuck, this is like Hong Kong.
No FUCKING way!!! Jesus.. CHRIST!
fugetaboutit!
Which contractor? Expose him/her!
BUT It WORKS !!!
Unions
it works tho
AC's drip water. That's how they work. Your car AC does the same. What is your proposed solution for this? The guy could have routed a pipe along the glass hidden in some material but then you'd be paying a helluvalot and still complaining. Given the location of the AC, what's your solution?
eeeh, foget abooouut it!
Nuke New York
Truth
Seems legit
25 cents for trying
Wtf😂
Trending?
Sue those assholes
bra
memes gone too far
Fake surely (I would hope)
Louis you're trending :D
It's New York, who cares. Everything is trashy and dirty there.
I've been in the HVAC industry since 2002.  This was a hack job.  But in their defense it's a window unit, they don't make an after market drain pan for these units.  What did they charge ?    I would have installed a auxiliary condensate pump below it then ran the vinyl tubing to a downspout or corner to drain.  The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from a location.  The moisture leaves the evaporator coil and sent in this case to the condenser then flung into the condenser dropping head pressure and discharge temps.  Increasing efficiency whatever is left drips out.
He got what he was willing to pay for. A hack contractor at $40 to fix it. \nGood ain't cheap and cheap ain't good. \nThe only solution I see is building a shallow drip pan, instal, seal it and hard pipe it down to the ground. I guarantee they wouldn't want to pay what that would cost to stop the condensation drip.
That's quite a liability having something THAT heavy sitting above a doorway
Well, this is what happens when you go cheap. Rather pay an actual contractor or some guy who says he'll fix the issue? You're just a bigot blaming contractors, reminds me of someone who blames a whole group of people for something committed by an individual.
license and unlicense contractors. Don't hire a unlicensed contractor and bash real license contractor.
OMG She's soo cute, and she sings so much better than me
Started from Dream now they're here.
I hope Claire will not turn out like miley
Awful.
The winner.. I hope!! :D
You take good care of the Crosbys!
I always love J Hudson’s reactions.
that song and this is cute and she is good
What I always say is If u lose The Voice, then u can try for X Factor and Agt, Bgt and etc.
Why are successful vocalists always attractive? Can unattractive vocalists have a long, lasting career in the music business?
If he gets to live playoffs where America votes then he automatically wins.  He is already so popular and has won the hearts of millions.  All Adam has to do if he wants to win this is not mess up and not make the wrong choice (like he has so many times in the past...).
Yes! Go Claire and the Crosbys . Awesome. Congrat. Hello from Washington State
What a boring and cheesy song.
Why is Miley still judge? Is she mentally stable now?
so is this guy gonna win the voice cause of his daughter?
Dave, is going on the voice going to interfere with you going to the planet Kolob, where god lives????
dave's voice is good❤️
I watched this in music class
For so long says Miley.
Omg! Sooooo excited that Dave Crosby is going to be on The Voice!! Love the Crosby Family!! Claire is such a sweetheart! Omg!!!! So excited!!

God bless the Crosbys!! Beautiful family!! 😍😍😍
The Crosbys!!!!

Thank you for  subtitles...
j hudson is a stuck up boring coach
Carson gets so excited for everyone getting a chair turned around. It deflates and waters down the excitement.
OMG I just realised she is Miley Cyrus
Is this The Voice ?\nHe's whispering ! 😱
Death Cab For Cutie's Ben is repping my city how crazy!
Ugh I'm so happy for this!! I missed out on his audition on Tv D:
And miley is the queen any way😍😍
Great voice control but it's kinda weak. Idk maybe he was saving it for that song, I just hope he has more
His daughter's reaction is priceless :)
I'm so obsessed! He's amazing
this lil love is the sweetest and purest soul i ever heard so far! OMG!
the whole family is so cute omg
He has a beautiful voice he has  fans already around the world he has a chance to win
At 1:44 Jennifer Hudson be like: Darn he's cute!
You've got a FAN in me!\n\n#Goosebumps!
I am so happy he chose Adam. Adam chose Dave first even before knowing that he is a famous YouTuber!
THEY COPIED THE VOICE PHILIPPINES!
OMG! I love this kind of music and his voice. By the way their moana cover was uber cute. ❤
Isn’t that the little girl from the care.com commercial? 😂
Congrats, Dave so happy you are going for your dreams too!
I was thinking of 'Hey hey, it's Ty Ty' then I realized this is a different show. And that little girl is amazing! God bless this family! 😘
His daughter should help her father to decide who he gonna pick
Hope Dave wins
Woah!! Perfection.
YAAAAS A MORMON!
MY FAMILY 👏👏👏
folk❤️
Claire got their attention
I've never loved Miley so much as when she purrs I'm obsessed with herrrrr! :)  Su cute!
Anybody from Seattle Wa here?🙋🏻
I thought it was Sidney Crosby for a second😐😐😐
This was viral? I never heard of this girl .-.
I hope he becomes a magician.
Kind of lacklustre to me
Dude already is a fan favorite
Father and daughter are good singer l do not get tire watching them.
Congratulations Dave!!  Love u and your wonderful family!!!  Been following you and Claire for a while now!!  Y'alls music brings me so much joy!
Wow! But the reaction of Claire 😅😂😂😂
What is the song playing when he chooses Adam?
Adam looks so defeated when all the other judges turned their chairs hah.
PEOPLE VOTE TO KEEP HIM THERE
Watching this video 20times and my heart still melted when he's and clarie come out and sing that song! 😭💖
Ahh, I'm smiling from ear to ear!! I love your voice and Claire is so cute. My daughter and I (she's 18) listen to you all the time. I'm so glad you got your shot and I think Adam will be great for your career. SO MUCH LUCK BEING WISHED TO YOU!!

Soo happy for you & your family. Your such a blessing to me 💕
OMG I recognize them now! Claire and the Crosbys! That's incredible!

Brilliant x
😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
That is awesome!
Is it me or he has pitch problems?
why does this have so many views? seems over rated to me...his voice was meh..
Congratulations, You have a wonderful voice and Claire is your inspiration.  I just pray that you remain humble and thankful to God and that fame and fortune don't separate you from Him.  Remember,  Matthew 6:24 says No one \ncan serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, \nor you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot \nserve both God and money.
OMFG CLAIRE AND THE CROSBYS!! Dave totally deserved those 3 chairs. So proud! ❤️
Meh, crap
Dude, nice shirt! Your favorite colors and your lucky number, I think? Pretty sweet
You Did Namaste in the end 😂

*Looks at guy watching movie on iPhone X*\n\nHey, um, dude, you're, um...you're MISSING PART OF THE SCREEN!
Reachability is possible with Assistive touch on iOS, so there's your home button to use it. Also getting quick access to control center and the new lock screen (notifications) and you can set it up with the quick access YOU want/need + since they now made Double tap, and long press settings possible on it with latest iOS 11 update beside it has 3D Touch on it also, it should be the same on the iPhone X. So one hand use should not be a problem, because Assistive touch is like a home button. Make it your own! 👈😎
Well time to by the Iphone 3
at first i was like why is he saying porsche like that but now i realize i've been saying it wrong the whole time lol

i'm legit happy for your success man. been watching for a while now. keep up the amazing work!
Should I get the 9 inch or the 12 inch dildo??????
Is it worth buying the iPhone se in 2017. And if Apple will bring the A11 chip in the se, then I guess it would be worth buying. Please guide. I don't have much to invest
what do you think they will name the next iphone after iphone x?
Why don't they embed the touch id in the apple logo
MKBHD know of anyone working on utilizing NFC tech for wearables so one can for example, have credit/debit cards, train passes, ID, etc in a smartwatch?
I don't care who corrects me. Saying iPhone x sounds better than saying iPhone 10.
Heyyy Marques , Which is ur  all time # Favorite # phone..
first time watching.  This has to be the most HD video I have ever seen on YT.  lol
Bro play store is not working/opening at all can you solve this please let me know ASAP

Do u think iPhone X can survive atleast half day with such a powerful display and 2167 mAh battery power.
Ellen said X instead of ten
Why are all of your videos so *Lit AF*
I love how ginourmous phones seem normal sized in your hands but feel every video should include you handling something smaller, that people recognize. I miss my S3.
Is it me or is the video and sound a bit off sync? Especially for the lipsyn part.  Hmm anyway, great video once more
Why you are not reviewing iPhone 8 only 8 is it not worth buying or reviewing. Not Plus not X only 8
People actually care about electric cars??
Hey do you think the price on the iPhone x is too much because if you think that I’ll change your mind
Dear criminals! Do not use IPhone X and you know why.
X is 10 in Roman numeric system.
wireless charging for cars , your garage will become a microwave , alot of health risks
do you have any plans about reviewing some Sony mobiles, considering its been a while since you have done one.

Not a big fan of the facial recognition stuff so far. My friend has the Note 8 and I just grab it, point it at her face, it unlocks, and I run away with her phone. Is this what better security is?

There's no question about it, consciousness comes from the brain. Don't insert pseudoscience into this.
So I'm not really existent on the animal rights scene but these test sound insanely wrong.
A very informative video about a very bad idea.
I wonder who woke up and decided to donate his body..
This is just in time for Halloween season.
I suspect that if such a transplant were possible the nervous systems wouldn't match up. It's not like stuffing a plug into the electrical socket where things line up nicely. I suspect that afterwards the person would experience extreme sensory deprivation and might even go insane.
This is going to go horribly wrong...
The healthy brain, if the surgery is successful, will still need to relearn how to control a body, given the fact that the person has been paralyzed all his life. So, even if everything goes fine, he will need tons of physical and neurological rehabilitation.
wouldn't it be quite a surprise if the transplant was successful but the guy claims to be and acts like the guy who went brain dead.
During kidney transplant the faulty kidney is not removed thus thw patient has 3 kidneys...
The patients body isn't dying.  He has a horrible way of life because he has some disease that his body doesn't work right so no walking and his arms don't work well.  I guess he's got to a point that he's ready to die if he doesn't get s good body.  I'm curious if the procedure half works like he can't move like a quadriplegic the patient was ready to day because his body was so bad but at least he could move a little.  Are they going to allow him to do an assisted suicide if he wants since he will be worse off.
How are we meant to know if it works without trying?
I'm just gonna wait until they create prostethic bodies Ghost in the Shell style, thanks.
I believe there will be one big fail :/
I will pray to my God to make this procedure fail and for the doctors involved to burn forever in their own personal Hell.
Lucky for me I don't need transplants. But I hope to have robot body when I'm very old and live forever YEAH!
PEG was used as a carrier fluid for electronic cigarette fluid early on, it wasn’t very popular due to its taste.
The fact this sotry actually turned out to be true and not some elaborate marketing for Metal Gear Solid V blows my mind honestly...
Is this a Jojo reference?
You are transplanting a body, not the head!
Is it possible to transplant a head of a girl to a head of a man or vice versa?
I have a feeling that some people with high power within the medical industry would undermine this.
I really hope the surgeons play Eminems 'Lose Yourself' during the operation.\n😆
its technically.. a body transplant
This will be an amazing experiment - even if it fails. If it works - we gain a major insight into the connection between the body and the brain in addition to getting a step closer to having a synthetically grown body replacement for spinal cord injuries, lost limbs and various other conditions potentially including death! Or, if it turns out growing a body is too hard or expensive, we can just wire the head into a robotic body able to keep the head alive until a replacement body can be safely grown.\n\nThere is a first time for everything. This body transplant was bound to happen sooner or later. Even a failure here will push us towards the first success. This will be a great leap in medical science one way or the other.
just thinking about it makes me cringe
Guys, don't get ahead of our selves. ;)
What if its the head's last hope of surviving and the body donor is already clinically dead?  why does the video only explores the controversial side but at least no a single different approach
Is this some sort of European April Fool's day that I'm not aware of?
Lots of your facts are incorrect. Do you fact check at all?
Not for me thanks, but I am a registered diner.
In the name of SCIENCE!!
I imagine we'll have better luck in the future if we manage to make trainable wetware interfaces - you'd grow a network of connections into the base of the patient's brain, then attach a signal processor. Do the same to the top of the spine of the donor body. Train computers to interpret each body's signalling, then connect the computers. This way, you could correct for differences between the two nervous systems with software. Much more precise than just hoping for the best in case nerve behavior doesn't match up between bodies.\n\nOf course, we'd need to figure out how to grow those artificial nerve taps first, and then how to probe the connections without causing brain damage
The dog head being kept alive is probably the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.
Drain the head of blood, seems like a problem recovering from that alone.
It would help if ur a dullahan
I feel empathetic for the person that is so desperate to be the head to be transplanted. At least you get to fade out in a medically induced sleep knowing you will probably never wake up. The person that is willing to do this is obviously doomed to an inevitable end and the person that is brain dead is in much the same situation. Neither person has much to lose here. Also this is probably going to be someone younger and capable of handling the stress and potential recovery. There's really no reason to make this political. If the doctors are willing to try it, more power to them. Think about this as if it is you facing eminent death, early in life, and you might have a chance to live longer.
Oh, idk maybe you should do this successfully on an animal first.... All those dogs and monkeys died minutes later.
sounds weird but I would choose to change my body with one from the other gender. I don't think this will make it harder? Or take the body of a chimpanzee!
I understand how exciting it is from a scientific technical viewpoint.... and do we really need that? Who is important enough  to revive this $$$ endeavour. It would be interesting to see what this would be fotr the new combined human.. there are memories by the body beside the brain... and for example the gut brain connection... i would rather have us figure out how we can make life  good for us and all living beings on this planet first... solving urging now problems... but humans curiosity of its ability to figure out nature seems non unstoppable
Do NOT search the video of the bodyless dog. Don't do it. Just Don't.
There are thousands of nerves in the spinal chord, are they going to just glue them all together as a clump or are they going to try and connect each nerve individually and how would they know which individual nerve is which? If they glue it as a single clump, how will the nerves know what to do? it's not like the nerves themselves can seek out and find the correct corresponding nerve to connect to. If they try to do it individually, the time it would take would probably leave the brain with irreparable damage. Morality aside, this is a fascinating and exciting prospect for medical science, although I doubt very much that there is any chance of success. Respect to the person volunteering to have their head transplanted though, even if I was a quadriplegic and dying, I wouldn't be brave enough to volunteer for this operation.
there's no way it's going to be successful
What's the moral questions about, if the donor wants to donate his life to science?
I've been reading about this for a while. I'm soo curious of the outcome.
Will the person have 2 different dna s. Or will the head adapt to the body or is it the other way around?
I'm hoping such a procedure does occur, and even more so for it to be successful.
If I was terminally ill I would definitely take the procedure, even on the experimental stage. I would also consider it if I was immobilized by an accident or a disease (if it was already perfected).\n\nIf they manage to do the thing safely, I suppose this will be a gateway for ~rich~ people who would like to gender swap with fully functioning organs
sound just like instructions on how to put a phone back together
How many spinal nerve 'glue joints' will there be?
i have heard of the news where sergio gonna do it and i cant believe that a month later i think, we are gonna see the first head/body transplant
Just transplant the guys balls there problem solved (if we can do that)
So, the important question, will this be televised if it goes ahead (sorry, had to)\n\nI mean i'm not a medical expert but i would be curious to see it happen, something that has never been done before
Not so bold prediction: the procedure will fail
...just asking for a friend
Well this surgery will most definitely be a huge failure.
Just FYI, watching this video while having breakfast it's not a good idea. Speaking from experience.
If i were dying, I would say kill me.
I've been waiting for this since forever, glad Canavero found new subject, since the russian guy bailed out.
They said 150 medical staff 36 hours. The person will be in a coma for 3-4 weeks to heal the body. Where is this guy getting his facts from?
This is completely crazy and creepy. I really hope he will succeed. It would be great for the patient and a great step for medicine.
I think I'll try and hold out for a full prosthetic. Masanori Ota has been spot on for his predictions so far so it shouldn't be too much longer.
Poor donor. Gotta live the rest of his days without a body.
if i was disabled or some other life threatening issue. then yes i would have it done.
skip tp 3:00 if you are not a moron.
Wonder how messed up the persons life/body currently is, who is getting the new body transplant, with quite a big of a risk that it might fail.
Wasn’t this just a publicity stunt for metal gear solid 5?????
i think you missed probably one of the biggest questions: where is the donor body coming from?!
Maybe this is body transplant
Just thinking about this is giving me the shakes, I do not like this at all 😵😳🤦
Wait..whose _body_ are they taking it from? That guy consented?!
Does he get to keep both passports? Portrait from one and fingerprints from the other.
I cut the nerve bundle in my index finger. The surgeon stitched it back together, but after 20 years I still have poorly localized feeling in that finger because the nerves are all cross wired and shorted together. Imagine a whole spine...
imagine the possibilities if this works
That's so freaky when you think about it.
Why... why why why why whyyyyyy wouldn’t they practice by putting accidentally severed heads back on their own bodies before doing this?
IMMORTALITY HERE I COME
Fish head curry anyone?
Mengele would be proud!
DOUBT
Dope.
Erw
MGS STUN
It’s alive! ALIVE!!!!!!!!!
They should never do this in a human before successfully doing it to a monkey.
You get a like for the holding back of the pun.\n\nBut it was a good one! \n\nHave a nice weekend, Greg. Don't get ahead of yourself. :D
Is this video directed at children? because wow this is said so childlike
Wait so whats stopping thr donor body from being drained of its blood when the original head is decapitated from it? \nSurely the exposed boood vessels will result in the heart pumping the blood out of the neck.... Its not like they can cauterise the wounds since they need the blood vessels to be intact
if the body  gets injured, lets say a cut, would his brain be able to communicate with his body to heal the wound if the dna wouldn't be the same?
Just to clarify, doctors do not remove the failed kidneys of the transplant recipient unless the patient is too small to carry 3 kidneys (like children) or they have a disease called Polycystic Kidney disease or PKD, which covers your kidneys with cysts and enlarges them to the size of a football. I had a kidney transplant a year and a half ago and I have 3 kidneys, my two diseased kidneys still sit in their natural position and the transplanted kidney in the front, right above the bladder.
Thats a real headscratcher... ok ill see myself out now :P
Can we stop calling it head transplant and inventing silly excuses for why we do so, and instead be adults and call it body transplant?
A question that’s prob been asked a hundred times but what are the little numbers that pop up throughout the video? What do they mean? \n\nThanks
The real question is, who the heck volunteered to be a body donor...
I just want a cybernetic body...
when we shake a pen or pencil it seems like a wave.why?
polyethylene glycol is a laxative...
What if is successful, then i can transplant my head to a young teenager body to live longer.
I am not a doctor but, how are they planing that the brain will survive minutes without blood? I thought that is pretty much the definition of being dead.
wow...never know they are this good
Amazing song as usual by my favourite Korean girls. Any other English speakers confused by the line I will coax myself to eat flour-based food?
their comeback is so precious... really love their song..!!!!
I want to make love bolbbalgan4 because her beautiful lol .
Just found out about them. Yo, I already love this song.😍😍
Every song of them so good
I love this song ❣
i hope to see her long hair again :3, however here i am again trapped in the repeating session of their new songs. Love you!
OMFG I LOVE THEM TWO SO MUCH. UM LEGIT CRYINGGGGG
I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't like any of their songs. I give it a try and listen to them, but I just can't seem to like their music. But it's nice to see an indie group slay the charts
I dont know why but i love all of the bolbbalgans's songs! It's so catchy & sweet to hear. You'll never get tired from listening to it
This would make a great summer song but its autumn already 😅
I need an IU x Bolbbalgan4 x Suhyun Collaboration right now please. ❤️
Baekhyun recommended these girls so i checked out their songs and i have decided to stan forever 💛💙💜💚
This song is catchy !!\nSOME make me think of that song LOL. What comes to your mind?
Her voice👌🏼\nReally amazing song, congrats girls for your ALLKILL 💕
I really like them. Their voices are so unique!

Try https://www.audible.com/numberphile and check out The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry\n\nEnvy free cake cutting (the paper mentioned): https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03655 --- A clarifying note from Hannah: n^n^n^n^n^n is the *maximum* number of cuts in the n person case.
Just cut the cake into sixtfhs and have two slices each? XD
but can you have chocolate milk ?
wtf was the point of this.
person 1. cuts three pieces\nperson 2. pick top two pieces and trims one to make two equal pieces (trim is added to other piece - not separated)\nperson 3. 1st pick\nperson 2. 2nd pick\nperson 1. 3rd pick.
So excited there's finally a Selfridge-Conway video on YouTube! I was thinking about making one myself, haha.\nThe first discrete and finite four-person procedure was just discovered last year (Aziz-Mackenzie), which requires 203 steps and 584 cuts! They don't know if it is optimal, though.
Interesting technique - the generalization to ethics is obvious - the solution tries to satisfy their preferences in a fair way in some sense. There is a problem though - an envy free solution is not necessarily optimal. Counterexample - person 1 loves frosting, person 2 hates frosting, person 3 likes a mixture of cake and frosting. If person 3 chooses the first set of slices then they could make three slices with frosting and cake in every slice without regard to other people's preference. The end result in obviously suboptimal  - the best would be one slice with only frosting, one slice with only cake and one slice with a mixture.
Problem. First person cuts completely even lets say. The second person can then cut one slice completely in half. The third person goes and picks between the two pieces that didn't get cut in half. Then the second person does not choose the piece he cut in half. First person gets the half piece and then the the other half piece gets split to both second and third persons enjoyment and first persons saddness.\n\nThe second person would have to be forced to take one of the pieces he chose to compare/cut. While maybe in the rules of the cutting method it was never stated in the video
360:3 = 120, what s hard about that ? Every piece is gotta be 120 degrees wide
giving makes you happy, to some point
I have a better idea: Cut it quarters since this is much more accurate, they each choose one, then cut the quarter in quarters (again more accurate than thirds), repart until the remainder is too small to matter.
Only problem is: IF people were indeed happy with what some authority figure tells them they have to be happy with, there would be an even simpler solution. But as they are not, this solution will only work for mathematicians who accept the proof.
If I put n=2 in the formular presented I get about 6.03*10^19727, but there is only 1 cut needed.\nIf I put n=1 in the formular presented I get 1, but there is no cut needed.\nIf I put n=3 in the formular presented I get a number which is too big to be ever written down, but there are only 5 cuts needed.\nThis formular doesn't seem to work.
Or just use a protractor at 120 degrees ?
1. I would listen to 50 hours of Hannah's mouth clicks.\n2. The pie shall be cut in two, and each man shall receive...Death. I'll eat the pie.
If you made the cake, you would of probably used scales to measure the ingredients. Just weigh the whole cake and divide the cake in to 3 equal weights.\n\nOr if you don't have a scale, give the smallest piece to the fattest friend and the biggest piece to the skinniest one. Fatties don't need extra cake.
from my practical insights it's awkward to cut a circle into 3 pieces but it is easier to cut it into 6, like they cut pizza, and then everyone gets 2 pieces each. But yeah nah if its cake we are talking about it should be divided by mass not by top view area, cause it never gonna be perfect all around, if its apple pie then one piece is gonna have more apples in it and so forth
and that's what happens when a mathematician tries to be a psychologist... Ridiculously bad.
1. Place the cake on a lazy Susan.\n2. Cut the cake into 3 pieces.\n3. Spin!! Spin it like you're playing a game of Wheel of Fortune..\nHmm.. Now how to decide who goes first?
The animation was so necessary.
Isn't it as simple as having a 60 degree separation? From the center ? I only at half of the video btw
I was trying to figure out how to make a perfectly equilateral triangle and after researching found that you just draw a circle, then draw circles of the same size with the centerpoint on the edge of the first.  Draw a third circle with the centerpoint on the intersection of the edges of the first two circles.  A fourth, fifth, then sixth circle who's centerpoint is always on the intersection of the edges of the first circle drawn and the last circle drawn.  Eventually you will get 6 equal points, from which you can easily find a triangle.  If you just cut from each point to the center of the circle you'd have 3 equal slices.
just spit/drool on the cake, so nobody wants it anymore, you wont have to share!
This should be on Computerphile instead of Numberphile 😩
Aah it all makes sense now... I'm i...
This is overly complicated. Cut the cake in half, cut the halves into halves, and cut two of those halves in half. Five cuts in total.\n\nFor three people. The model doesn't work for anything but three people.
There is a flaw in the way you described that.\n\nIf Charlie chooses the _trimmed_ piece, Bob needs to cut the trimming.  Simply put, if Charlie takes the trimmed piece, cuts the trimming into pieces and Bob chooses his trimming piece first, Alice could be unhappy because Bob got more trimming.
Cut it into 6 equal pieces  (pretty easy it's like slicing a pizza) and each of the 3 people gets 2 pieces
warm mucus-y milk... Just gonna leave that comment there...
well that wasn't boring at all
Or you could just cut it with three lines, done.
why not just chop it into crumbs and give each person a spoon.
Simplified version, person 1 cuts into 3. Person 2 picks favorite two, makes them equal. Person 3 gets choice. Person 2 second choice. Person 1 remainder + trimming. No need to cut the trimming into three, waste of time plus everyone is already happy. Person 1 probably didn't cut perfectly and the trimming should make up for that.
I think we can skip dividing the trimmings.   Bob has selected his two favorite pieces, X and Y.  Bob is then required to trim off part of one, and ADD it to the other.  So let's say Bob trims off T from piece X.  That trimming is added to Y.  So now we have X-T and Y+T.  Bob does this such that he would be equally happy with getting either X-T or Y+T.  Charlie then chooses between those two. Bob gets the other of those two, and Alice gets the one that Bob left alone.
Or just use a protractor.
Or just cut it in half 3 times and everyone gets 2
there is really easier way to do it as well ... just buy 3 cakes :D
just cut it in 12 equal pieces and give 4 of them to each one
Hannah Fry is an absolute marvel of a person.
Just divide it in three
Why not cut it into 6ths and each person takes two? That would circumvent the awkward cutting into thirds that always looks quite difficult
Or cut it normally and don't eat a whole third of a goddam cake
THE CAKE IS A LIE!
The way I hear it, if I get that audio book, Hannah will come to my house and pour a jar of honey into my ears. Absolutely terrifying.
My dad always said life isn't fair.  Obviously fairness is a tool of mediocracy.  I think now I'm just envious of whomever still has an actual piece of cake.  I guess sharing just isn't appreciated.  It needs to also be fair.  Ergo no more cake. The cake is a lie.
Or just let an adult cut the damn cake.
I clicked because I thought this would demonstrate a method for cutting a cake/anything into three pieces evenly easily, which seems to be the actual problem here.  First person to cut is assumed to be okay with any of the three slices, but that's not what would happen as they would inevitably screw it up and leave one larger than the others.  Everyone will notice this, and the cutter will definitely not be getting that piece and will certainly envy the person who does.
Welllll you could just cut it into 6 pieces and give everyone 2 -_- (yay common sense)
I just use a 360° transporter ruler to mark 0°, 120° and 240° and cut along those lines.
You get what you get and you don't throw a fit. Unless you're trying to solve a math problem.
It's not the point, but the easiest way is to cut the cake into six pieces. It's easier to make the pieces equal in size AND everyone gets two pieces.
If I have to share my cake at all, I'll never be happy.
Oh for pity's sake.  find the center and cut it at the appropriate angles.  problem solved.
Or cut it in 12 parts and give each person 4 pieces.
You can also just get a triangle and cut out 3x120 degrees, or purely math by calculating the arch length and make little chocolate markers where to cut when done calculating.
i usually pick last. Also i don't like cake...
Bob is NOT happy since he had to slice the best portion. He is almost happy, he definitely is the saddest among them.
Start by cutting the cake into six pieces.  Then, going around the table, each person picks their favourite piece.  Then, going around the table in reverse order starting with the last person to previously pick, each person picks their favourite out of the remaining three pieces.
This did not deserve a video. At all
This is the exact same method as used to make a straightedge. You compare all 3 peices to each other over and over until they match
Bob can just buy a protractor
cut it six ways, each person gets 2
Based on your last equation, if n=1, then it would theoretically take 1 cut to divide the cake amongst this 1 person. What does this 1 cut do for the person if they are still getting the whole cake in the end?🤔
Cut in 6 pieces with just 2 straight cuts, all 3 get 2 pieces...
For 3 people, 3^3^3^3^3^3 is definitely a lot more than the number of cuts we did. What am I missing... Maybe 3 was a special case?
I expected the video to be about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_diminisher method. As it was not, what are the advantages of the method presented here? At least it requires more arguing, is harder to generalize to more people, and Bob might be unhappy he was not able to choose his first choice but had to cut something off.
wut? There IS an easy way to divide circle in 3 sectors equally and it's well known. Shame on you, numberphile!
blend the cake until it's all crumbs and divide by weight.
See, this is entirely ineffective for me and the few people I share cake with, because none of us want a fair piece of cake, we just want the biggest piece so that the others don't get it - if everyone's happy, you've failed.
Way to over complicate it... most fair was it measure the cake using a tape measure, and use some math and boom there ya go. Easiest is to just cut it as a peace sign and go with it.... You guys WAY over complicate life.... Numberphile: Complicating Life Is Our Business.
Been using a similar technique when splitting up herbs between friends!
This was fun, but here is real life: Person 1 - Oh dear! Cutting into three pieces is harder than I thought. I should have....
This is why you dose the ENTIRE cake with iocane powder, after spending years building up an immunity to it.
Equally sharing a cake between three people on a math channel. Must be geometry... Nope, its game theory!
R A D I A L \nT H I R D S
Life would have been so much easier if a regular hexagonal baking tin had been used.
What if the second person just cuts his biggest piece in such a way that when the shaving is added to his second biggest, the two are equal? Then 3'rd person chooses, then 1st.
No, cupcake... no. \nTwo is a couple, three is a crowd. \nSo, for envy free cakes there is just one solution: For whomever wants cake - the kitchen is that way. Flour on the top shelf, water at the tap, milk in the fridge,  they'll figure it out.  \n\nBTW: There is no such thing as free cake. Be it envy free or otherwise.  :))
Or you could stop complaining
Will put this into practice immediately. Hooray for maths! :)  Thanks for sharing this exciting paper.
You're going to hit on this chick in public
In the mean time I would have brought a scale weighted it so that 3 are the same or even measured it and would be a lot quicker.
just cut the cake into 6 pieces and every piece ist about equal, every one gets 2 pieces, everyone ist happy.. (except the cake..)
just recently discovered?  lemme guess... in the break room at their university math dept.
That's the ugliest cake I've ever seen!
This doesn't work with people who cannot into logic.
Or do it the easy way and cut it into 6 pieces and each get 2, achieved by cutting the cake in half 4 times, but hey, i guess there is no complex equation for that.
I have a far better system that is quicker and works with far less cooperative and more distrusting actors.\n\nAdam Ben and Carl argue over how to fairly divide a cake until Adam makes a proposition.\n\nAdam Permit me to cut a one-third portion and if you think I cut too large a portion for myself then I give up that portion of the cake to you\n\nCarl oh yeah and I bet Ben will take that piece just because he's before me in alphabetical order\n\nAdam nope. My system doesn't depend on either of you getting any priority treatment, that first slice is not for me therefore for BOTH of you. You can divide that like a regular cake, one cuts the other chooses\n\nBen nice try, what if you cut a tiny slice? That'll screw everything up\n\nAdam that is the offer I am making, I cut a one-third slice and if you don't want it then let me have it, either because I screwed up and cut myself too little or I was truly fair and cut myself only my fair share.\n\nCarl I see, you have every incentive to be fair as if you take too much then Ben and I both EQUALLY benefit as we split it.\n\nBen yeah, if we both get a bit more than 1 sixth each then there'll be a bit less than 2 thirds remaining\n\nAdam and that remaining two thirds I split between me and you by 'one cuts the other chooses' if I make one piece bigger then you'll take the bigger piece. Then that bigger piece you split equally.\n\nSeems fair to me, if the cutter tries to cheat, then whatever remains equally benefits the other 2 by one cuts the other chooses.\n\nThis assumes there is no subjectivity, that everyone knows what is a fair piece and there's no chance Ben will say the first slice is too big yet Carl say the first slice is too small.
Guide yourself with a Spinner... at least that thing would be useful for something.
Much easier solution:\n1. Anna divides cake to 2 parts;\n2. Bob selects one of them. Anna gets the second;\n3. Anna and Bob cut their own pieces on 3 parts;\n4. Charlie selects 1 part from Anna and 1 part from Bob.
Person who's birthday it is gets the biggest slice. If it's no one's birthday, person who baked the cake gets the biggest slice. Simple.\n\nBut honestly I thought this video was going to be about an overly elaborate way to cut a cake into perfectly equal thirds.
How about this? Person A cuts, attempting to be as equal as possible. Person B chooses the piece for Person A, and C chooses his favorite.
Why not just always cut the cake evenly into 2n pieces and give every person 2 pieces?
*the cake is a lie*
or rock paper scissors
That animation is terrifying
just get a scale ffs
Why not cut into radial thirds
This is awesome!
White people problems amiright?
Congatulations on your wedding!!!!   I would be so scared to eat moldy food even though I would buy it.  LOL  🌴💖🌹🌸💚😛🌺🤗🌻😀🌴
You should have shown us the projects that failed. would have been nice to see what went wrong.
Mike looking like he just finished a 2 hour sex sesh
Dammmmmn commitment ✌️😁
I literally had no idea what miso was made of! The things you learn on this channel. However I have 0 patience so I think I would just buy this
Next time: homemade tempeh? :)
You are not supposed to cook the miso for minutes. It actually looses flavour the longer you cook it. You are suposed to add it disolved at the last step and then turn the stove off inmediatly or ideally just before adding it. You'll realise like that that a little bit of miso will add more flavour than a lot of it cooked for minutes
I woke up to find a Brothers Green Eats and a SortedFood video in my subscription box. Is today my birthday or something? Anyway, congratulations on your marriage!
Congrats bro!
I didn't know I was a type of rice.
Nice idea, this miso tomato soup.\nBut first you cook your soup and then you have to add miso at the end of cooking. Miso shouldn't get boiled. The mother of my husband is from Japan and told me so.\n:)
Heck yeah, glad to hear you're married and well! I'll step up my miso game too and abandon my stores soup packets
Congratulations. Just subscribed to your new Instagram. Are you still living in New York. I see your brother has moved. Wishing you much success
Just wow
I made this yesterday Mike and it was amazing - thanks for the recipe!
Oh, miso honey, me love you long time.
Thumbs down because you never took a bite on camera.
Congratz mike!
Whenever I make homeade tomatoe soup it just tastes like vomit...
Why do the tomatos look like persimmons
Hi, I really admire You, You have encouraged me to do sooo many great projects, grew myself a combucha scoby and making it daily now, also my fridge is full of cured meats, also doing sourdough daily, you made me dive into cooking even more, even though I was already crazy about cooking, now I am mad about it :D Respect what you do, @brothersgreeneats  👊
Spain is just for tourists, it fucking ducks to live in there
Eww scraping mold to eat fancy. i have a sourdough starter in my kitchen, no mold.. We eat Miso soup in Hawaii when sick. You should do an Aloha food vid.
Not clickbait, nice <3
Congratulations!!! Yay love!
Awesome. Miso is the bomb but never made it myself. Will have to try ... currently have three duck breasts drying in my fridge. Thanks for your videos!
I really thought this was going to be you trying the Chipotle queso hahahaha

Damn Andrew Garfield making YouTube videos now holy shit
I would love to see you guys do a video of recipes using matcha!!!
Koji rice is so cool. I keep meaning to start a miso...I’ve done the steak aging
finally, glad to see you, seen very much awkward bad and vegan food while you were gone
this soup looks incredible! i love the simplicity --- definitely making.
Love your dedication!
miso😋
Hey you should embarrass your self and sign up for master chef season 9, lol
Congratulations, Mike!
I remember that episode, it's soo exciting to see the finished product and seeing you enjoing it. So happy for you!
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Made this for dinner. Amazing
Gz!!!!\nNice Ring \nGoood luck from Germany
Congratulations on your wedding!  I hope you and your lovely wife have a blessed, happy union.  We have all been waiting impatiently for your videos, guys!  I won't lie, I'm totally heartbroken that you are both married LOL.  What wonderful spouses you must have.  Keep up the good work guys, we are looking forward to your next series.  Miss you Brothers. Xx
3 seconds off of that extra ad revenue. \nRespect.
does anyone have a count on the word miso ? lol \nall jokes aside,  great vid. Miso is the shizz.
well Hey, Lets meet the Mrs.............
Think maybe YouTube Red would take your show?
What's the video about?
He is so much different when he’s not high
Do you have any recipes with Tofu Noodles. i've been making it sort of like a Pho.  Curious to see what else there is to do with it.
Thought I was watching cheese
Yay! My favorite BG brother is back...
This is so cool! I didn't know that miso was made like this. Could you try making tofu?
how long can you store the ready miso paste, and where would you store it?
Welcome back! Missed you and look forward to all your projects. Thank you for sharing.
miso is kinda halfway to soy sauce. so try making soy sauce next?
Where's the link for  the koji rice?
Wooow, i'm from Spain and I appreciate thaaat :3 crongrats for ur wedding. I watch eeevery vídeo and I LOVE the channel
Congratulations! Was afraid we were down to one brother. Lots of big changes for Brothers Green. Now we need some cooking challenges every now and then. Test tasters would have to travel -- almost sound like a perfect job for your parent (grandmas will want to visit more when grandkids come along). Of course, Mama Green may not be the best judge for two of her own. LOL.
Thats a lot of miso. I could take some off your hands if you want
I've made miso soup about 5x's now & LOVE ❤️ LOVE ❤️ IT!!!!! A lot of Americans are unaware of it, it seems.
That looks so warm and comforting.\n\nCongratz on ur marriage❣️
Hi! I'm from Spain and I'm really glad you have enjoyed your trip here in Spain :)
You should make some asian style grilled cheese with that misomato soup😝
Guys if you can't find Koji rice, you can make miso paste by combining store bought miso with cooked soy beans ( yellow peas work as well) and salt. Leave it ferment and don't forget sprinkle a layer of salt to prevent mold.
Watching this as I'm eating my 90¢ ramen and pretending I'm eating this instead. Looks so good!
Yayyyyy, the boss is back!
Freaking love you alls channel. I have been watching y'all for a few years and I just love the content but yalls voices are soothing AF as well 😂
So is Brothers Green going bye bye since they're both doing their own thing?
I can easily make this vegan, thanks!!
this looks great! i've been wanting to get some koji from japan  (natural import company http://www.naturalimport.com/ --it's where i get ume vinegar, tamari and toasted sesame oil, etc.) but i wanted to try the korean method where they don't use koji, it takes a year and you get soy sauce and korean miso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGhKwCq7SZk
Anyone know where to get his spice jars???
All of Europe is pretty chill from where i visited. America only seems to be in a rush.
You got married? Oh you poor fool. I hope it's a painless.
Palm sugar and other palm products aren't sustainable, man. Smh
You got some doo doo in that jar? Good for you, finally a chef who can cook a good doo doo dish!

I dont usually eat in the morning, but watching this made me hungry for this recipe. I can definitely see myself doing this.
where is the other bloke?
Just made this soup...It's absolutely incredible. Mike, you godsend fucking genius! The soup is so rich and somehow creamy.I've been watching your videos for a while now but this is the first time I follow one of your recipes to the letter. I was mind blown about how simple and yet how delicious this soup is. THX
Bros Green... how is it that you guys are so ambitious and hard working yet so chill at the same time?
Went to Spain. Sucked being black.
There is more people in that one shot than at my entire wedding, is that sad? :P
First of all ... Congratulations! 💍💍\nSecond .. That miso looked ammazzzing\nThird... To get all the benefits of miso you should only add it at the last minute and don't let it boil.\nBon appetite 🍜👌🏻
congrats on your wife achievement unlocked :)
just want to make sure if this channel will keep on going well.... since you and Josh now seem to have other things to work on separately
I'm so glad she went solo!!! This girls deserved to shine by her self!!
I'll be watching this until the music video comes out
She's so cute
Camila stole my heart and put it in Havana!

She's so hot and talented
She honestly doesn't need autotune at all!!! She is such a QUEEN ❤
fifth harmony songs is all about sex..this song is music.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL , POWERFUL , AND SEXY.  I LOVE YOUR MUSIC. YOUR ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL.  YOU DESERVE A GRAMMY.  KING TONY LOVES YOU.
This is the first time i am watching her ... This song is awesome but...she looks a bit like janice from f.r.i.e.n.d.s 😂
The trumpet guy just jamming in the back is literally me
The only poppin Spanish women I can think of off of my head is jlo but now camila is added to that list
Didn't even notice she said La Yuma YASSSS QUEEN <3 Bringing in that Cuban slang <333
Lol 1:40. I thought she was going to smack her dancer’s ass
Her ass is bigger than my face
So whose the one playing the trumpet?😍
REST IN PEACE TO WHEN POP STARS SANG AND ALSO SERVED SERIOUS CHOREO... IN GODNEY WE TRUST
I love the song but I am the only one who think it was kind of playback
This reminds me of Solange stage set up
Simply flawlees , she is my Queen

I'll love it 👑i love you ✨Havana yea......let's see I'm going to buy her C.D and wait for it's👑✨😘

I'm happy to see that's she's doing really good and wearing more clothes than what she did in faith Harmony
I LOVE THE SONG SO MUCH.!!

The best performance I’ve ever seen

There was a dot in the background (in the middle, little bit to the right) that annoyed me XD
Yaaaaaas Camilla! This was badass on all levels i love it! She did this with no effort and like a boss!
Camila has been a true inspiration for me for the past 5 years. THIS PERFORMANCE IS SO SASSY AND BEAUTIFUL! I feel like a proud mom watching this no kidding. She has helped me to be strong and brave. I decided to do a cover of TOO GOOD AT GOODBYES, it is actually my first cover on youtube🙈 its pretty scary, but I cried a lot to this song, its close to my heart & I just had to. If you could go and take a look, would mean a lot to me! Need your opinions🙈 Love only ❣️
This has replaced 'Despacito' as my obsession song du jour. Ooh na na...
Leaving the group was such a good decision!!!!
i like this one without young thug
she's a true artist
I love here she's my role model <3 I'm from Havana
She's killing it 😍😍💕💕
Only camila cabello can slay dancing and singing at the same time💘😭
She is such a queen and just deserves the world 💓
I like how she involves a feel from her roots.
This performance has officially made me her fan. Wow! Me encanta! Love from Vietnam!

No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
Lifelong Liverpool fan and have always liked Gary Neville ... he hated us and we hated him ...a born winner he was a top quality player and very solid guy
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
that moment when you leave Gary Neville hanging
Do you hate scousers.. erm... haha I love the hesitation.
I like Gary but he's wrong about Suarez, if United ever signed suarez it'd be a disgrace to the legend of Uncle Pat.
Gary being interviewed by the British Seth Rogan!!!
Lol how'd you manage this, nice one.
Can not believe neville has actually just said he would love suarez at united might be a really good player but after what he did to evra i would never want him anywhere near man united
Great interview, Gary could talk the hind legs off a donkey, awesome fella.
Football punditry has taken a huge leap towards the Simon Cowell end of criticism. It's immediate and tabloid but it works. Most pundits have taken on a contrived media persona now and are almost certainly delighted to be the talking point in the days after a game. Not saying that's a negative thing, I just find it interesting to see this generation of ex-pros going into a television studio and not continuing their careers through management. They suffer from the same ego issues we all do.
I don't hate scousers now says Gary and cue selena's bad liar playing in the background 🤣🤣
Love listening to him
The intro made me skip to another video.
Well done Gary - always talking sense as usual
Man Utd have always appointed british managers? Tell that to Frank O'Farrell Gary. Man Utd have traditionally had non-English managers, because, in the football world, there is no 'british'.
Best football pundit at the moment
The hairdryer question...I swear I could see Gary's fear coming back onto his face.
Confused when seeing the thumbnail; thought it was prankster EdBassmaster pulling one of those funny faces.
lFC  you'll never win the league  ha ha ha come back when youve  won 18 ha
Amazing work. Been awhile since you uploaded anything, that was definitely worth waiting for! Happy to have one video a year if that video ends up being a sit down with a United legend.
Yip, Jose has never hung around that long at clubs. \nBut he's never been manager at a club like this and all that we encompass ❤️
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
Intro song??

Gary Neville is a true United legend, bless him!
Quality interview
Don't want Suarez. Thanks.

I don't understand...
I hate this short vines from this guy but he is damn good. Fucker
I used to do full combos on love live without any problems when I first played it, when I redownloaded it I realized that I can no longer do a full combo on any songs anymore. ;__;
Is this chonny/ like I honestly can't see any difference
Why are this guys videos always trending?
this isn't vine \nit's YouTube
what did I just watch.....
HAHAHHAHAHA my god. That was perfect. Again, the ending is always what makes me burst out laughing.
Can you do a video where When games let you use custom sound effects. I think you can use your imagination from there. 😉
I want to be this man.
Any DDR players remember the end to Paranoia REVOLUTION where it all sounds over as the song fades out, Then 50 more notes in 5 seconds come at you?

Hey, mad props! I often see fun dancing videos and think to myself it would be even more fun if they could actually dance. You definitely pass that test.
Wonderful! You and your new friends are great dancers
I love this girl's spirit!
Well done for such an entertaining vid  @0:49 Do like mummy and daddy version of joining in - even if didn't get out of their seat!  Betcha slept well when you did finally board your plane after all that dancing!

An entire crew of people need to do this that get cancelled for weather(airlines don't pay hotel  for weather)
I wanna do that...
This is GREAT!!! Love it.-j

And you can dance girl! Great bunch of worker/dancers too.
I enjoyed this video and OMG, you are also HOT!

not michael J , the moon walk came from : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQyzajlkxJ4
This made me so happy! Next time I am faced with a challenging situation, I'm going to try and channel your energy!
Hi.. what app did u use to create the video?
I was at an airport once for 24 hours - on Christmas Day - on the other side of the world - the person who was supposed to pick me up - didn't - was unreachable - glad you had a good time (seriously, this was awesome) I did not.
Great job taking a bad situation and making it fun that's soo cool 😊👍🏼👍🏼
All this video does is make me smile. Thanx. That Moonwalk was perfect. In many ways, so are you. Look at my youtube music channel.   https://soundcloud.com/rusty-hornz and   https://www.facebook.com/RustyHornzMusic/?ref=page_homepage_panel
You're so graceful, and what a cute video!!! Now I want to go to the airport and dance. ;-)
You are THE BEST.  Can't tell you how much this cheered me when I needed it - AND you are a great dancer!
The Quality of Our Lives Is Determined In The Quality of The Questions We Ask Ourselves and Others... Our Choices! ~ Choose Well My Friends! ~ It's NOT About What Happens To Us That Matters As Much As It Is What We DO About What Happens To Us That Counts! ~ Let's DANCE!
That's awesome! Way to make the best of a bad situation :-D
hit that moon walk love the choice of deodorant lol
You look like Kangana Ranawat...don't know if I spelt it right
Wow she's good!
This made me smile and I needed it today. Thank you! :)
Damn..that man in the suit...has got some moves...I wonder if he is single...yum. I wanna be stuck at that airport...looks like great people...compared to jersey or berlin.

What an inspiration you are!  Not only did you turn a downer situation around for yourself but look at all the smiles you have put on peoples faces.  You are my inspiration!  Keep it going!
I wish I was White,and smelled like feces..Then big butt white women would like me. Sucks being handsome, and black
If I ever get stranded at an airport, I hope you are there!
Absolutely hilarious at 0:52 typically something me and my mad Parsi friends would do!

LOVE IT!!!! sooo awesome i wanna dance with you guys too!!
Just saw her on the news.. she is fine as HELL!
Very fun video.  Great job on making a boring night into a fun one...
Great work Mahshid.  May I suggest changing the title to 'An Iranian Girl All Night at the Airport'? That may change the wrong negative image of Iranians around the world!!!!!
I have no idea who that girl is but I really want to be her friend.
I usually write down some really off the wall comments, but I like the video. Great job!
You are SO beautiful and funny and such a great dancer! this put a huge smile on my face :) You need to have your own show...you need to have your own 24/7 channel!!!
Ааххахахах))) молодец:) Belarus
See, people can get along with each other! Music and dancing are international languages and this is the proof. Thank you, Mahshid - you're a great dancer!
You have brighten over 1M hearts.   Thank you!
I've been stuck in airports before and I didn't have near this much fun. I need to up my game. Thanks for the inspiration Mahshid.

MY BABYSITTERS A VAMPIRE
I MISS MY BABY SITTERS A VAMPIRE JSJSNSNNS
My babysitters a vampire anyone ?
I wish envy was here to say put your mouth up to the mic 😕😎
Charlemagne pretends like he is okay with gay people but you can tell he is uncomfortable.
Im not even an advocate weed smoker and Bryshere is DEF HIGH AF. He got all the symptoms and its super obvious.
Lee is funny - and bayard  rustin - very crucial
This kid's fade is flawless
10mins left in the video and I just realized that Envy isn't there 😂😂😂
Lee sound like he still on drugs... He loud sweating and seem confused
Why did that Yazz nigga or whatever his name is keep whispering the whole damn interview??? That shit was irritating the hell outta me
What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul and booty hole.
Their energy together is strange.
what medicine are you on that cause you to whisper?  lmao!
That lil dude made it weird. He acts like he trying not to say yes sleeping with lee.
DID HE GIVE DAME HIS MONEY LOL
Why is Yaz acting so weird damn is he tired,high or somethin this interview is really awkward af but Charlemagne is hilarious as usual 😂😂😂😂
Bryshere really looks a little off for some reason..especially around the gay subject convos..I've never seen him so solemn in an interview..
Lee Daniels fuckin the shit out of Hakeem. 😂😂😂 allegedly
Why is Bryshere acting so stank? Uncross your arms and talk into the damn mic lol
Why Hakeem act like he don't wanna talk? 😂
With all due respect and keep in mind I’m saying with all due respect Lee Daniels look how my mom used to like when she was going through meta-pause at the beginning of this interview.
Lee Daniels is smashing that dude on the low
It's 2 minutes in and i feel like this video was going to be boring... I'm out
Why did Lee Daniel laugh like that when Charlemagne asked brishe what don't you do.. @11:39 this interview hella suspect
Man this a dry ass interview
dope ass interview. Lee was cool to me
Lee is a classic narcissistic. And he's fucking the shit outta Hakeem
Charlamagne had me dying laughing at 47:56.  He's a straight up fool for real. lmao
What's up with the folding of the arms between the both of them 👀
Y u make those comments about black women being aids patients
The scene at 7:27 has me dying. Especially when he sips the water at the end. Idk, but something seems off with this interview.
Not watching empire no more that show going be like the show . the game
I Enjoyed the interview I was not fond of Lee based on What Monique was saying bout him. But He seem Mad cool. But Ummm Yaaaaaz seem still young and impressionable..He hasnt truly found his voice as a Man alot of still kid like ways lacks confidence. Or maybe cuz Lee was there he felt he didnt matter. But I would hope Lee aint bothering that boy like some comments been saying. But Lord in this World who knows. SMDH.
Nothing about this interview was awkward 😂😂 y’all are weird.
did Lee Daniels wipe his sweat as if he has a wig on.... watch it..
People need to stop acting like homosexuality isn't wrong, just because its become more accepted in society today doesn't make it right. And America has turned into a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah and Babylon and I believe GOD is not happy with America today and we wonder why so much destruction is happening in America today because America has turned her back on GOD and made the devil her GOD. So as long as she continues to serve the devil instead of GOD America will always be a country of confusion and destruction. America needs to stop saying that she's one nation under GOD and say she's one nation under the devil.
The interview is always going to be awkward if Angela Yee has to start off the questions
Lee has the most dangerous and scary energy I’ve ever seen on a person. He’s or whatever that being is, is not good.
Lee Daniels has an awful personality. You can see that he has many unresolved issues.
🏳️‍🌈
Yall complain when a black director makes movies about slavery.. yall complain about white directors making movies about slavery.. yall complain that theres TOO MUCH movies about slavery and yall complain when theres not enough movies about slavery... CAN WE CHOOSE ONE THING TO BE UPSET ABOUT DAMN! \nAnd I felt like Bryshere had the loop of the teacup being stirred playing in his head this whole interview.. anyway much success to Lee
Something is off about this interview,, I'm catching gay vibes from Bryshers
lee stay strong and leave the haters in the dust
empire better have ratings through the fckin ROOF with all these commercials\non here today. 😩😩😩
Is this shit old bruh? Niggas acting like this season 1
Bryshere look like the donkey from shrek when i was looking at his teeth.
Oooh, Bayard Rustin! I remember there was a documentary on him called, The Other Brother. It was on cable LONG ago. He definitely deserves a widely released film. Yeees 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love Lee Daniels, but this was the one of the hardest to watch interviews I've ever seen on the BC.  Lee's interview on the Marc Maron Podcast is really good.  Lord Bryshere should have been left at home.  I couldn't get through this mess, way too much effort to get through..
breakfast club, y'all FAKE... why you ain't tell Lee to stop cursing? 😂😂😂
I am I the only one that thinks both Lee and Bryshere were high off something
That was a really, really great interview 🙌
The look on Mr Lee face when yaz exposed saying he on a 360 deal LMAOOO!! 13:15
Niggas on the thumbnail look like two dragon ball z villains jus arriving to earth before the show goes off
Man Yazz if you don't get yo whisper song talking ass out of here!  TALK...lol... Still watching Empire tonight :-)
This whole interview feels like i’m watching an episode of Law & Order SVU, and the child is so scared of his abuser,  he looks for approval before completing his sentences....  \n\nCharlemagne is the abusers attorney and Angela Yee & Envy are Stabler & Liv trying to catch this dude in a lie to book him....\n\nand the back glass is the 2 way interview room mirror where the captain and the child psychologist watch hoping they slip up in their story.. *Queue up dramatic music*
Interesting. Lee, quit playin'. You are definitely still gettin' high. And you have something sexual w/ Bryshere. Hell, any foo' can see it. Bryshere is so numb to it all (figuratively). It's best that you keep yo' shades on, Bryshere. Yo' eyes will say something that yo' mouth won't. Lee, I had no idea that you were on crack, powder and crystal. Again, interesting...
Say what y'all want about CTHG he is a star and culture mover,This nigga wild asked Lee Daniels to do For da🍆Challenge man that's just Genius 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let mr lee live people ..he is great he is changing peoples lives
i wish they wouldn't whisper i have my volume up and i can't hear well
Someone shud of asked yaaz how it felt f***ing his tv brothers real life wife 😂
Being gay is mental illness...it was listed in med journals
DAMN. Did Bry not want to be there or something? It is so weird and offfff to watch lol..
Lol So I'm convinced that if I see that gay flag in any other vids niggas sweeter then C&H suger!!!
The black community is everything but civilized, educated, or industrious people but yet they're a bunch of hard-working drug dealers, whining booty twerking ass thugs, who will never amount to anything but government assistance an mooching off of the next person, looking for handouts.The only thing that matters to blacks is guns, money, cars, and rap music
is Byshare high or he just woke up ?
This nigga super gay I'm out
Natural interaction ....good interview
I love my kids He sound like Michael
I Pray someone is not using their hollywood powers to sexually extort and control this young man,,shame on you if so,, the vibe was very uncomfortable to watch!! Something is very wrong with this pair. Love you Bry
This interview was cringeworthy.  @ 22:48 bryshere caught hisself tho, he almost slipped up So the Miami trip where we fell.......  Both these niggas suspect af.
He had Bryshere screaming oh big daddy all night long when he was blowing his back out..
I’m so use to seeing Hakeem so aggressive on the show it was weird watching him ok here he seems socially awkward
Well Big Daddy Lee call auntie Mo Mo and tell her how you really feel lols
I love The Breakfast Club but I can't watch this. Empire is garbage. LMAO!
Majority of the people commenting did not even watch the interview.
Lee Daniels did hakeem hair b4 the interview
We watched this on a flat screen I look around and everybody in the living was frowning like they was about to throw up shit ain't natural
Very weird. .. I'm out !
he been skipping chest day.....
Charamagne is ignorant 😂😂😂😂
That cocaine got them draining lol... 👑
THEY ARE DATING 🤐
Bryshere just high y’all lol
He got a potty mouth lol
The ending tho 😂😂😂
lee fuckn that lil boy!
https://youtu.be/qKXmawcTQbo
Mom kicked u out 4 wut that story sounds bogus 19 clean yo room rigggggggght
Boring ass interview
i like freaking Charlemagne....lolo
Ackward AF
I LOvE STAR!!
Awkward.
Bryshere calls Lee “Big Daddy”.
45:37 Charla's laugh floored me LOL
I apologize...good interview
Faggot lol
Lee Daniels seems obnoxious and he keeps interrupting ppl
Tight fade Bryshere! Dope!
Hope you're alright Hakeem !!!
Lee definitely hitting that
I bet the shades are covering his water filled eyes,his whole self looks sad like he just wants to cry. hopefully he didn't give his body up for this fame ,he really looks depressed.
Zoe, you can use that rose gold tiny watering can as a vase and add little wildflowers in them or something. It's really trendy right now, I see it all over Pinterest :)
fall vibes are the best🌅🌙🍁🍂

I have super soft sheets as well and I love them. I use them in the Summer too lol. One thing is the pillowcases make your hair really staticky, but for me it’s worth it because it’s so comfortable :)

You are amazing
Love it🎃🍁
Clicked on this faster than I blinked
I was singing Christmas carols in the school lunch line today 👍👍🤶🎅
SUCH AUTUMN VIBES 😍😍😍
You're right to worry Zoe, I've had fleece sheets before... never again! That being said, I'd still use the main sheet from the set as a minimalist duvet in the thick of winter! It looks good with a fur throw, but has to has cooler sheets underneath...!
You're actually the bestest
I love your videos!
I wish the video was longer!
Love how in every single video recently, the word 'autumnal' appears at least once 😂
Quante cose belle!! A D O R O 😍😍😍
Awww Gabriella has the same peach bedding ❤️😘
I'm not excited for this movie, but I'm gonna watch it, cause I already watched 1 and 2, so might as well finish the whole thing. And it's an OK movie. First one was good though.
I'M SOO GONNA WATCH THIS ON CINEMAS!!!
,,You can't safe everyone, Thomas. ,,I can try.  I think they were talking about Minho or Newt😭
THIS LOOKS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THE SCORCH TRIALS!
20th Century Fox, Wes Ball, if your reading this, please make a theme song for TDC right away. ‘Cause I think It would be nicer that the last series of TMR if it has a theme song... Well, If I were the one who’ll choose a theme song for it, It would be “Fairly Local”-Twenty-One Pilots. The song is really connected to movie even the first movie(The Maze Runner) and the second movie (The scorch trials). I am a Biggest fan of Maze Runner and Twenty-One Pilots so why not you should put a theme song for the movie. It would be nice to me.  🙂😄😆😁😀
Yesssss im waiting for this all time!!! I bet it will blow the cinema!! I LOVE MAZE RUNNER!!!
I really need to read the books because I know the 2nd movie is very different from the book.
Now *THIS* is a trailer!!! I'm so excited but I can't believe it's the end. It feels like I was JUST watching the first movie in theaters.
I don't know if this will be good or not, this book was...kind of disappointing to me. Not denying it is still a good read however, it in my opinion fell short of the bar the other two set. I can't but fear this movie will let me down even more. I'll still see it tho.
the hype is real
Omg when I watched the first 2 I didn't even realize my boy peter was in it... spoiler\n\n\n\n\n\nR.I.P little finger
YESSSSSS I READ THE WHOLE SERIES (EXCEPT THE NEW ONE) I LOVE THE MAZE RUNNER!!!!
I'm dying now.....AND THERE ISNT A CURE TERESA I HATE YOU SO MUCH\nAlso im glad Dylan is fine now so they could make the movie!
It's really disappointing how much they changed it from the book, and the outcome of Newt is way different
So, uh, when's it gonna happen? 25:0 minutes in? Or will this also be messed up?
No infinity war trailer....\n\n\n\n\nI guess this will have to do...
I’ve read the book but I’m still watching this shit😂😂😂
yas finally new movie of the runner maze :o \nThomas lol
I'm waiting for a certain member of the Right Arm to appear. Audiences will have their minds BLOWN. But I am not waiting for the you-know-what moment to happen. You know, page 250? Sorry, forgot that I wasn't supposed to mention that dreadful page. But that part.
The Maze Runner: Fury Road
If its a movie about running away from things their should be way more black people in this😂😂
honestly I'm more hyped for the kill order movie to come out
OMG I WAS LITERALLY JUJST WATCHING THIS MOVIE LAST WEEK WITH MY FRIEND AND HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS AND THEN I SAID THEY MIGHT BE MAKING A NEW ONE AND HERE IT IS!!
ayyyee my birthday is is in january
oMG U KNOW HOW I FEEL NOW?
Who else had to reread the books and rewatch the movies cuz u forgot everything
It seems to me that it’s nothing like the book.
Finally part 3 of my favorite Movie of all time
This better be good.  Because the scorch trials movie in my opinion was not even close to the book.  Pls no hate just saying my opinion thx
If it's anything like the book then newt will die😭😭😭
**S P O I L E R  A L E R T**\n\n\n\n\nWhy is everyone say “ OMG 250 ITS COMING TO THE MOVIE!”\nGuys the book isn’t always the same to the movie.  \nJUST BC ITS IN DA BOOK DOESNT MEAN ITS IN DA MOVIE\n\n\n\n\n\n**M A J O R  S P O I L E R  A L E R T !**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT WHAT IF NEWT DOWSNT TURN INTO A CRANK AHHHHH RIP NEWT
I've read every book
Where's the asian dood?
When I first saw this I had the biggest smile
FINALLY! IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS AFTER READING THE BOOKS!
Yes I can't wait 😍😍😍😍😍
I hope it is like the book\nBecause the second is way to different comped with the book
RIP newt fans who haven't read the book
I promise myself I won't cry.\n\nAfter the movie:\nCRIES INTENSELY. \n\nLooks like a need a whole box of tissues when I watch this.
OMG ON THE NAME OF THE LORDS COME ON I WANT THIS MOVIE NOW!!
They could have a better actress for lead role tbh.
Dylan O'Brien my babe is back
I’m not ready to see my newt DX
I see Little Finger
The cast will be ready to retire by the time they finish the series. Job security!
It's been 84 years...
all good. just where is avatar2
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Seen every maze runner movie except that one
I don’t need it \nI don’t need it \nI don’t need it \n\n\n\n\nI NEEEEEEED IT
I'M NOT PREPARED TO LOSE NEWT
I am freakin waited for it! Yes god!
One of the most awaited part of the trilogy and guess when does it releases? ON MY BIRTHDAYYYYY. yipee. and btw its a national holiday in india. so thanks for the gift. this is the first thing i am gonna do.
wait for this movie
Time to rant: \nOf course the books are going to have more content then the movies! If filmmakers put every little detail into a movie, the movie would be so long that nobody would go watch it. Movies are already expansive to create and take time so please stop commenting how the book is nothing like the movie, the filmmakers are trying their best.
I red the book and I hate it when the movie took a wrong turn like the last movie. :/
THIS IS REAL THIS IS REAL THIS IS REAL THIS IS REAL GUUUUYS

Ben is such an amazing husband, you really were blessed with him, Jenn! God bless y'all!! :)
Who disliked this!!!????
Just Beautiful, thank you!
Beautiful video. Wow.

Cuties baby girl 💕
Such a gorgeous video!
You look perfect together :D
BEAUTIFUL!!!
i love you both sooo sooo sooo mutch!!!!! <333
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Aria is soooo cute😘😘
Thank you for sharing😍
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Thank you for being so honest ,because a lot of women are a shame to say what really happens and one one person is honest then a makes way for other women to feel okay to be honest 😊
do more videos of aria please! shes so cute
This is my favorite video of yours so far
Thank you Ben for sharing your side and your experience!
this made my heart feel soooo warm and hopeful! what a beautiful couple inside and out, pure love for y'all
U guys r so cute and so supportive
It's funny that my 2 favourite beauty YouTubers are named Jen (Jenn Im) and coincidentally their husband/fiancé are both named Ben 🙂😮❤️🇨🇦
Such a beautiful family:)
I remember when ben would never be in front of the camera 😅
Thank you so, so much for making this precious video! My son is about to turn 8 months, and your video helped bring back a lot of memories along with a big reminder to remember and appreciate my husband's struggle as well. Thanks again!!
You are a beautifully loving family. How lucky you are to have each other and how blessed your little one is to have such devoted parents.
such an emotional video. I think we all cried :') \nit's so cute that Aria already knows how to always smile to the camera in this video
This was so so emotional to watch Ive never even had a baby but it made me feel so many emotions.  This was super insightful and beautiful to listen to!
WOW this was amazing to watch. I'm nowhere near a baby but I love watching your pregnancy videos
As soon as Aria came into shot I could hardly focus on anything else Jen and Ben were saying. She's too cute. xx
So great idea to also share the dad story ❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ God bless your fam! 😭
This is so sweet!! Thank you for posting this video and sharing both sides of your experiences with pregnancy, birth, and life after baby. :D Congratulations on your family and I hope you all have a blessed life! Sending love and hugs!
Every single time we see Aria, she just looks so happy! It must be because she knows she has the most loving, positive parents ever! What a beautiful family! Seriously Aria is the CUTEST HAPPIEST baby I've ever seen!
What a wonderful husband you have. You can tell how much love and respect you both have for each other. I wish more men were like Ben, the world would benefit.
she's such a lovely creature
I've always loved seeing Ben on his Snapchat stories while he was playing with little Aria! Also how incredibly she resembles him :) \nI've loved momtember. It's a pleasure seeing your videos!
Thank you for sharing your beautiful story. I love that you mentioned how the sacrifices increased your love for each other. I have a nine month old daughter and we can totally relate to you both!! So comforting to share the struggles. It's so worth the hardship to be a parent!
Oh that's the best video! I was in tears! We just had our first baby daughter 3 month ago. It was so great to see dads prospective even though we discussed it with my husband!! Thank you very much for that! Brilliant video!!
This is such a great video. Thank you both for being so honest and vulnerable about an intense time in your lives. It is so greatly appreciated. You two are fantastic parents!
i loooove this video so much, thanks guys- youre going to be great parents :) Jen, can you make a video about things you would and wouldn't to for your next pregnancy that you did for your time with Aria? In terms of mentally (i.e relaxation, prayers etc), physically (i.e practice breathing, exersize, massages etc) and so forth? :D
I wish my husband was like Ben.. When I had my first baby, he wasn't all the time with me, I had to be strong for my baby. I didn't sleep at all, I felt sad all the time, i cried alone.. He was more interested in his cars then us :'( \nNow my baby is two years old, and I have a 4 month old, but he is almost the same. But now he's priority is sex, he is always thinking in sex! :( I don't know what to do.. I'm sorry to tell my life here, i feel like expressing my self, to get out all my stress..  Jen and Ben, I wish you the best!! God bless you guys!
She has ben’s hair lol. This video makes me jealous that you guys have such a wonderful healthy relationship and family. Thank you for sharing your journey.
What an adorable family! Thank you Ben and Jen for sharing your story.  Aria is so precious!!!
my throat was really tight the whole time watching this video :')
Can echo what you guys mentioned.  I had a hard pregnancy myself, but because it was so hard, I loved my baby and my husband so much more.  Thanks so much for sharing!  It's so important for the husband to also express his emotions and all too!!!
It is so cute that Aria seems to give response to Jen & Ben's conversion! She seems to understand what you two meant !
So honest, I love it!
!!! love love love this video Jen! my boyfriend and i also have this clingy but very strong relationship and I cannot wait to show him this video when the time comes(couple years from now lol) i feel like this video is so honest and helpful and I am so grateful you decided to film this! i wish your family the best :)
Where can I get myself one of these bens
Thankyou for sharing you story. I love this momtember series ❤️❤️❤️
Most beautiful video! You are amazing parents, Aria is so precious! Gob bless you!!!
Wow!! so great to see the both of you
Such a beautiful family!!! 😭❤
I cried so much 😭 you guys are so sweet
You made me feel better. :)
Such a beautiful story!!! You guys are amazing parents!!!!
She's seriously the cutest baby I've seen
Ah, it's so hard! And we are about to do this again...
You are so, so blessed, Jen 😭❤
Jen and Ben, you guys have a wonderful and beautiful family ❤
This is so beautiful! Y'all remind me of me and my husband, May God bless you and your family!
Beautiful, Just so beautiful :) Have 21 month old and 5 months pregnant :) New journey has begun ❤️❤️
Moms, you guys are ridiculous -Ben 😩 it's one of the Best Compliments any mom could ever get. Thank you Ben for recognizing how ridiculously hard being a mom is. God bless your beautiful family!Aria is one blessed baby to have you two and soooo cute & adorable
You're such a beautiful family 💖💖💖 and Ben is such an amazing father. Hope my future husband will also be so supportive and nice! :P And you can totally see how you're so in love with each other!\nThank you so much for sharing!!
Aria is a twin of Ben!! Even the hair style 😂
Hi Jen, you and Ben mention that you're almost always doing everything together. Sometimes I feel guilty for seeming to be so clingy or being seen together too often. Would LOVE to hear / see more often about your relationship with Ben, how you two built such relationship, and also was there any initial challenges that you two met, given that you're in a relationship with someone from a different race. \nLove, Linda
Oh im sorry Ben and Jen. Toward the end of the video, I only listen but my eyes is watching Aria 😂
I have to say, I rarely leave comments on YouTube videos (been watching this channel for forever though) but, I've loved this series so much. Both your experiences have mirrored so much of what my husband and I have experienced as new parents (our LO is almost 8 months now). It's so validating and comforting to hear you both speak so candidly about your journey. Thank you for sharing and for the unexpected support :).
Also, can you two please counsel my husband and I? 😂 you two are amazing and so sweet to each other.
Great video. I can relate a lot in that my husband is also my best friend. We do everything together and dont have boys/girls night out. What Ben shared is very similar to my husband's experience too, except he was too nervous to cut the cord. Aria is amazingly adorable! What a blessed family :)
I love this video!!!!!
Benseeing who I was singing to\nJen(almost crying face)\nBendon't cry\nJen I'm sorry\n\n😫😫😫you're too cute together I can't handle
This is one of favorite videos ever. You are an amazing couple and it's great that you don't take it for granted. I will definitely show this video to my partner, as we are trying to have a child too, after ten years together. Thank you so much ❤️🙏🏻
Relationship goal!! What a beautiful and loving family <3
Jen!!!! This video is gold. Having my daughter and how stressful and painful it was for me and my husband during the first year. I could relate in so many levels to everything you discussed. Thanks Ben for sharing your side too! :)
OH my goodness this is such an amazing video!! Thank you for posting the mans side of things. That’s is so thoughtful and true! Of course the moms go through something very life changing but the dads as well and I appreciate you posting this
Such a sweet, genuine couple. So nice to see this on youtube :)
Thank you so much for this video <3
<3 your relationships. I can't stand being around my SO too long. Lol
awwwww sooooo lovely! aria is the perfect(and much better) mix of you two! so lovely couple
I love this series!!keep it coming please.
Did not expect to cry this much watching this video, but it is really awesome to also hearing the father's side of everything, which is definitely not talked about as much. Thank you for doing this. This makes me look forward to having a family in the future.
This is one of my favorite video.  So touched and cried too :(  I am definitely going to ask my husband to watch this video when we will be pregnant.. ❤️
So nice to hear from Ben,  he should be in videos more 💁🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🙋🏼‍♂️
Such a sweet couple. Congratulations!
Awwww seeing little Aria was so cute! Thank you Jen & Ben for sharing your story! I think I cried like a baby 😭 so sweet how you both recognized each other's sacrifices and love each other even more than you thought before!💕
Such a wonderful family you have. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The way Aria admires her papa 19:48 is SO precious!! <3
Family goals ❤ You all were made for each other. Really interesting to hear the father's perspective.
If it makes you guys feel any better, I sobbed right the way through this video lmao
This made me tear up a little. I appreciate your honesty telling your story 💓
Oh gosh I cried. I love you guys so much! Great job Ben!! ❤️
Ben is a good husband 👍🏻👍🏻
I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months. It's not all rainbows when a baby comes into the world, so thank you for being honest with these videos to show people the truth.
After Aria entered the screen, she was all my eyes stated at hahaha. Sorry Jen and Ben, I ignored you both for the last part of the video 😌 She looks like a little elf with those pointy ears, so adorable!!
Ben is such a sweet considerate husband😭😍 Its so true! you always hear the moms side of the story but truthfully its hard for both side. Im currently pregnant with my 2nd child and this time around i could feel how heavy my husband's shoulders are trying to take of the family in every aspects. Big thumbs up to dads out there too! They got alot of responsibility too! I also heard dads can grt post-partum depression too. love your  mommyhood videos!! ♥️
Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.
Omg you have the cutest family! I love how relatable you two are! It's so refreshing!
Ben is such a gentle, understanding soul <3
HE IS SO PERFECT WTF DONT LEAVE HIM EVER

You are only *just now* making an effort to keep people from using Velcro as a generic word? Probably a little too late.
Hook and loop - 3 syllables\nVelcro - 2 syllables\n\nSorry, sticking with what's easier to say.
Funny video but I'm still gonna call it velcro lmfao
I didn't even know Velcro was an actual brand till now.
This video is clearly meant to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Nobody at Velcro thinks this video is going to change people's vocabulary.
yeah good luck with that.  talk to Xerox
I'm still going to call it Velcro. And if that makes you cry, grab a Kleenex.\n\nNow where did I put my Vaseline...?
It's funny I haven't seen Hoover make sarcastic youtube videos.
This is hilarious. I had to check to be sure, but I'll tell my customers we sell Velcro brand hook & loop. Or just Velcro for short.
The sneaker heads will be like\nAhhh he got the hook and loop\n\nSorry guys. Doesn't work.
Apparently people on YouTube are very bad at recognizing joke videos and picking up on when messages are tongue-in-cheek. How can you watch this and think Velcro is doing it in earnest?!
velcro sounds better
lol this marketing is actually pretty good, it's just a hit or miss thing, next time just get a few bots to get that initial positive reaction so the community follows. or u know, hire me.\nanyway, peace.
How to backfire, John Oliver Style.

Get better at marketing then??
I love VELCRO® Brand hook and loop.
Not sure why everyone is so butt hurt. This is a clever and creative video with a hilarious message. I dig it.
Not only will I continue to call it velcro, but this song has further persuaded me to purchase non Velcro branded velcro.
My Velcro didn't hold up now I have to get some Kleenex and Clorox to clean the spill and probably use some Germ X after.
It's too late. Velcro is already common parlance for that type of fastener. Just like band-aid, and kleenex are common parlance now. Give it up. And no one cares if your trademark goes away.
I'm calling it velcro anyway just out of spite. That way, your trademark with dissipate as it becomes common name. Just like  all band aids are band aids, so now the brand has to call it band aid brand.
this was actually fun
This is like trying to tell me Plato isn't a planet.
No worries guys, nobody even heard of you in Poland, there won't be any infringement.
I wanna work there
Brilliant song, very catchy, well made point, very funny, and yet... it's still fucking velcro. The difference between Velcro (R) and velcro is the logo and the (R). If you didn't like it you shouldn't have waited 60 years to address the problem.
I actually love this! and the song is so catchy!
This is one of the best things I have seen all week. I will try very hard not to call it &*^!@# and share this to anyone who will watch it on ... that social media site.
Comments are full of idiots who don't understand satire.
Guts, it's obviously a joke, calm down
should call it ssrrcccctttccchhhh one word and its the sound it makes
Hook and loop? Nah, velcro.
overly expensive - generic velcro far more economical.
That's just glorious. Thanks for the link, Reddit.
I suppose they want us to stop calling shirts with collars polos, referring to mopeds as vespas, and assuming all pregnancy pills are plan B also.
What if lawyers from companies all over just tried to get trademark laws changed to reflect the way that information spreads and adapts in a society with social media?\nThink it was bad before the internet?
Whatever the hell they were trying to do with this video, they failed.  Also, this message is at least 30 years too late to change how people talk.  Probably more.
Can you guys just become a company that manufacturers music videos of interacial lawyers singing.
Redditor and legal enthusiast here (I once beat Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney). These lawyers are right, it's wrong to use VELCRO® as if it were a common word. Social Justice has taught me that cultural appropriation is very real and harms creators of that culture. Therefore, we are appropriating the company culture of Velcro Brand Companies when we use VELCRO® outside of its intended legal context. Please refrain from velcroing this video with your ignorance.\n~Bertie Gallagher, moderator of r/legaladvice and r/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, IQ of 172
I'm going to find some off-brand velcro, and just stick it to things. I may the Hoover up the mess, when that fails, i'll go Google the way to do it properly. We don't get to decide how the world uses words, stop being a cuck about it.
Internet and people's mind 101: I don't tell people what you don't want them to do. Cause it's gonna be worst
Inb4 video is deleted.  \n\nThis company that makes velcro has goofed up.
Do people actually call bleach products Clorox? I've not heard it personally as common for bleach. The others? Sure
Velcro shoes is using it as an adjective, not a noun or verb. Editorial my friends, editorial.
Honestly you should called yourselves Hook and Loop so that you won't have to worry about that stuff
Saying, velcro shoes places the word velcro as an adjective. It describes the type of shoes as a noun modifier.
It is and always will be velcro, no one would even know what I'm talking about if I said hook and loop get outta here.
I think I've just been velcroed...
from the same people who brought you the yo yo and the slinky
Ok so wtf is up with this INSANE 90s NOSTALGIA CRAZE and NO ONE has brought back blading or even talked about it? MAKE AMERICA SKATE AGAIN
Ok i got go now lemme get my velcro shoes and my velcro wallet and my velcro socks and my velcro car and my velcro jacket
Tell that to Hoover. :-)
Working as an aircraft mechanic, EVERYONE in the industry will call it Velcro, so it a WAY to late to change the naming
Okay okay I won't say it anymore!
Sorry, no one is ever going to call it hook and loop. Thats just reality
ok i wont, do I get a cookie
I found this hilarious lol\nUnsuccessful.... but still very funny
It is like Band-Aid too
0% chance of hook and loop taking off, but a damn catchy song nonetheless.
ok this was hilarious well done, from now on if i see it i'm saying  that fucking hook and loop
lol why are so many people getting butthurt about this video. yall a bunch of virgins. thumbs up for pissin off reddit nerds.
They are my velcro to the other velcro part....
kys
Self-qualified lawyer here. I absolutely *adore* this video, for it reinforces the belief that we should protect the very best of our society, including multi-billion dollar corporations. It's sickening knowing that people are appropriating VELCRO®, knowing fully they are diminishing the real brand. As an upstanding Redditor, I'll upboat this video for visibility, so reap karma VELCRO®, you deserve it.
Velcro.
omg ha
Velcro\n\nTrademark (TM) 2017 Velcro R company.
velcro
Velcro right?
Velcro for president
Dang. Velcro Lawyers harmonizing something fierce at 1:44
*Velcro.*
I'll stick to velcro..
Velcro.
VELCRO!
Maybe it would be cheaper to just give up the trademark.
No.
no
this is bad
If you own or work for Velcro you are making bank. This is how corporations control you. Slowly and surely.
Marketing: We make bags, straps and bookends now. TIME FOR A REBRAND!
And if you make a mess using Hook and loop remember to hoover it all up.
justin mercado wasted the first comment, then edited it, then wasted second comment and edited that one too, then ten minutes later he came back and wasted third comment. Now I'm sitting here getting 5th when I should have 3rd.
I just took time out from hoovering the inside of my JCB to google that. I was so distracted I walked straight into a dumpster, and  now I need a band-aid for the cut on my arm. I wiped some of it with a kleenex, and smeared some vaseline over it.
for doing this dumb video,  I will always call it velcro and I hope you lose your trademark
I didn't waste my time watching the whole vid , or reading all the comments, but didn't you 'lawyers' steal this song?
This video straight up made me cry for some reason. Like this is a hook and loop kicked in and I sobbed.
sorry but your annoying bleep filled song isnt going to work. Its Velcro. Deal with it.
I don't care. It's called velcro no matter who makes it, just like band aids, roller blades, kleenex and myriads of other things.\n\nI will not let some corporate stooge tell me what nouns I should be using.
This video gives exactly the reason why to call it velcro in the first place. Trademarks are stupid. Nobody wants to make lawyers richer. As soon as you have an idea and share it, it should belong to the people. Making money off of an idea is wrong
Generocide is a thing layers.
Velcro
Can I replaced all my nouns with VELCRO®?
This is amazing! More name brands need to be like this!
Hook and loop? Maybe if you had a shorter, catchier name for it we wouldn't have been calling it velcro to begin with. I'm not going to call it hook and loop.
I was with you until the censored swearing.  I would have shown my kids, so they could learn the right way, but you had to make it dirty.
I can't tell if this is supposed to be funny. But with so much going on in the world, and the local all-news station deeming this important enough to mention, all I can say is: Boo-Hoo! What problems we rich folks have to contend with.
Thanks for bringing him on great guest. I loved Home Improvement!
what a fuckin crybaby, partially redeemed by the blow talk at the end
i can see all of tim allens face\n\nwhat sorcery is this
so basically this guy is a dick
3:35 the look Kathy Griffin gives you when she says Im wet
I fucking love this man, just pure awesome and real
It bothers me what Adam doesn’t know about Chaplin’s mustache and movies in general
Nothing like watching aged white men bellyache about being chastised for harmful & obsolete views
I know that philosophy major.
Who's the fat douchebag? I'd like to punch him right in the fucking face .
Get Alex Jones on
This interview gives the impression that Tim Allen might be a little dim, at least in certain areas.  Not focused or rational.  Not a truly deep thinker.  I'm neither fan nor detractor.  I like GALAXY QUEST and TOY STORY.  But Mr. Allen seems either bored or limited during much of this episode.
Holy lord, this Tim Allen guy has a mighty high opinion of himself!
This was why I love this show. Another classic.
Who is Adam Eget? Every time this happens on the show I actually feel for the guy a little more.
I have yet to hear an Atheist say It's all an accident \nMagic man done it!
I think Norm's A bird's not covered till 26 was lost on a lot of ppl xD LOL
Egret would like to sing Blue Velvet
Congratulations to Adam Eget for improving. I actually laughed a few times at stuff he's said. It all seemed not on purpose, but maybe it was, I'll give it to him. Tim Allen was an ok guest. Absolutely love Steve O'Donnell. Did they ever explain what he was doing in front of the cameras though?
Last man standing is a good show & it's a shame it was cancelled!!!
tim allen's a bit of a dick
Where can I buy Adam's Blue Velvet shirt!?
trump is a white supremacist and so are his supporters
There has to be a Russell's teapot for Tim Allen to not believe in.
Hey Norm using union labor for your set? That table bouncing around is so annoying and I am not even sitting at it.
I wish Randy Savage had lived long enough to be on this show.  Would have been fascinating.
For info, last man standing discussion starts at 34:45 :-)
I'm wondering what the hell happened before the last break. Seems like they pointed out the yawning thing and things got tense. Seemed like he really wanted to leave and Norm attacked him for it. Then the Candy Man stuff. Then Tim Allen retaliates with the small cameras comment.
Has anyone explained why I'm sitting here? Steve O'Donnell looking a bit befuddled @ 56:52
plz c if u can get dick van dyke ! He is a forefather.  Maybe not a stand-up,But a comedian nunthaless. If u can give us bruce jenner barf ! U owe us that. 🎥
Norm's still got it.
I've been a Norm MacDonald fan for many years. Had the pleasure of seeing him live in the Tempe Improv. I suppose Adam Egret was working there back then.\n\nTim Allen has never once made me laugh.
What an enormously and profoundly stupid fellow (Tim Allen, that is)
One of your worst interviews Norm.
SHE WAS A HOOKAH!!
Bring back Otto and George.
Amy Schumer steals her jokes and gets rich is that FAIR?
34:15 THE santa clause holy shit what a blast from the past
Too much joke analysis, brother. Just read em, like everyone else. Trust us...we get Norms humor.
Staring at 1:00:13 Adam Eget makes a joke that was three years in the making
Had no idea Tim Allen was this funny and witty
Another fantastic show. The joke section is back and it's great!
Tim Allen looks like a 50 year old Dave Faustino
six-hundred and fifty grams of ideas
Once in a while I catch Norm burping on the podcasts. Cracks me the fuck up! https://youtu.be/WYkil1tblt8?t=2780
What in all of hell has happened to Mr. Norm ? Please dear Lord bring back politically incorrect Norm  ! Please .
man i love every episode but the best are when jokes is the guest actually having fun.  or norm having fun.  this time was both.  great discussion and awesome end.\n\nalso laughed my ass off that tim answered where do you get your ideas and they skipped like 2 or 3 break attempts
Tim Allen:  Who is Adam Egert?  -  haha, truer words were never spoken
Tim is a J dude for sure...
Tim allen is in great shape, fair dinkum
You guys are brilliant, BUT...Sen. Joseph McCarthy had nothing to do with any\nhearings on Communism in Hollywood. His was a completely separate Senate\ninvestigation into Communist subversion of the State Department and the\nArmy in the 1950s.
All great comedy hosts have the laughing jack ass side kick \nAlthough they all don’t jerk off punks underneath the bridge like eget
Dat blue velvet t-shirt.Nice adam.
Yay, all the butthurt snowflakes who cried cried cried over Sarah Silverman and Caitlyn Jenner can finally fucking relax.
Red Wings hat? Seriously? You douchebag, traitor, wet-back mutha fuker! lmao\nGreat show fellla!
The Mr. Rogers story would have been badass
I want to hear that drunk carpenter joke. That's twice it's been burnt.
Tim Allen = worst joke reader of all time errrrr?????
Archie Bunker loved his daughter and wife and grew to care about his son-in-\nlaw. But the writers had him give his opinions about women, homosexuals, race,\netc., in a stupid way so we could laugh at it in a joke he wasn't in on.  He\nwasn't right about everything.  Someone tell Norm.\n  Why aren't I surprised Tim is a Trump supporter?\n  I've liked either for humor but judgment isn't their strong suit.
You can tell that Tim is a well season pot head and he smoked right before this interview. Hot off the press obv
Adams, where do you get your ideas from joke got taken seriously
easily the best episode since Sarah Silverman....
Holy Shit
who's Adam Eget?
Tim is an unfunny hacky comedian
Adam Eget looks more and more like shit with each passing episode.
LOL, there's not a chance in hell Tim Allen was ever paying a 50% overall tax rate as a nightclub comic. He's funny but also a goddamn moron.
finally a good one
Aw man, what happened to the super zoom independent French cinematographer?
This was a great episode. Tim Allen is a better guest than a lot of the others recently.
mate this is a classic..............well done....
I'm so glad there's a joke segment!
Great interview & my first Norm Macdonald Live. Norm was great on SNL, especially with the Weekend update. I will be watching more interviews in the future.
Please get Martin Short.
Buuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrp[
H3 Podcast unintentionally brought me here
Caulk not Chaulk.
Go Wings!
Allen was/is an underrated standup
Hey Mr. Candyman.... my nose is empty!\n\nLOL!!!!
Charlie Chaplin AKA Funny Hitler
*slowly turns into a roast..
The frisbee joke; genius.
24:56 from Super Dave
Does Norm have cancer?
cool podcast!
Does Norm like Hitler, or does he find him to be a bit of a jerk?
Gods will is an invitation each day to do the right thing.  He doesnt intervene in the affairs of men. YOU have to enjoy and fill your own self with the benefits of Gods will.  Going to bed at night with nothing of drama waiting for you in the morning.  Wow.  Feel that.
Lost me on the religious BS
Norm has had a lot of great guests since he started this, but none better than Adam Eget. Actually, Gilbert Gottfried  and Tim Allen about the best. Gottfried was totally unexpected and Tim Allen was to be expected. As I write this, I can think of about 5-6 more great guests he's had. However, it all comes back to Adam Eget. Love the guy.
The longer I watch this show, the more I realize Norm and Adam are way funnier than any guest
I never thought Tim Allen was dumb. Guess I was wrong. He said what has government done for me?! 😮
I used to hate Tim Allen, cause his comedy was blain, but now he looks better as he ages and he stopped giving a fuck what the public thinks of you. which is the best comedy
Norm's silly little internet talk show is providing yet another shining example of why mainstream network television doesn't get it, sucks ass and needs to die. This was brilliant. Good guest, great laughs as usual. Norm is a natural in this setting. Interesting topics. Why isn't this on a network? Glad it's on Youtube for free anyhow. Buy some flowers yah fuckin' cunts.
A few years back, an accretion of calcium formed in one of my kidneys and eventually made it's way through my urethra and out the end of my knob. That experience was not as painful as these 2 guys playing mental ping-pong over atheism, a subject they clearly do not understand.
Thank you, Norm, for having the great Tim Allen on your show. Very refreshing that you took a break from the progressive fruitcakes, transgender queens and bull dyke lesbians.
So Hugh Hefner gets to hell, and the devil says to him:\nThere isn't much room for new people in hell, so you'll have to replace one of these three baddies as he gestures to three closed doors.\nThe devil then shows him through the doors one by one.  Behind the first door is Mao Zedong.  Hef notices that he is getting a hand job from a Playboy bunny.\nThat looks ok. says Hef.\nThe devil holds up a finger sharply. Not so fast, you haven't seen the other two.\nThey leave and go to the next door where they find Stalin who is getting a blow job from a completely new Playboy bunny.\nI like this one even better! he says.\nThe devil smirks and raises his hand in a just-hold-your-horses gesture.  They come to the third door and find inside Idi Amin pounding violently into a very cute Playboy bunny from behind.\nNo need to think this one over. Hef says. I'm going with door number three!\nVery good. says the devil, who claps his hands and loudly proclaims.  Playmate Vicky, you are released from hell.  We have your replacement.
Gotta remember these guys like Tim Allen needed a lotta cash to keep up his homes, cars (and a hell-ova lot of em!) I mean who that was born say in the 1990's ever really heard of Tim?Example: In 25 whos ever going to really remember Sandler? And thats fuckin sad! Robin-Will, dying the way he did and a perfect example of what I'm tryin to say! Prob. couldn't perform or even go on stage without the drugs?? Don't really know but my fav of all time comedy/drama/ or dramedy; the f-in best out there in my opinion!
Norm road that hey candy man joke a bit too long.
Love Tim Allen and this episode, but In order for you to be an atheist there has to be a God is some pretty stupid logic.
That blonde lady wants some of 50 for sure..that body language and flushed face 😷😷😷😷
Whoopi looks good
what's the song playing when he's coming out?
Anyone know the name of this song?
What's the intro song called
This was a great segment with 50 and the ladies!
OMG you are good hugger. What a compliment...
Trump did everything in his power to lose and still won ... Kinda like driving down the street and a dog darts out and you swerve to miss it but still end up hitting em , ... It was an accident !!!!!!
50 your a sell out what happened to I love trump
You're a good hugger AKA I need the D!
What song played when he came out?
Anyone know the name of the intro strong for 50?
Bumb. Praise one son and condemns another.
Dammm 50 selling out
Come long way from doorags
What the song called
why don't you talk to a veteran's family that lost a loved one and see what they think oh and what these guys put out is not music it is noise just like listening to to lady's cluck cluck cluck shut up already who cares about any of you and your opinion good luck I don't think after seeing this pilot show you will make it
His suit game is always good
Country music legend Charlie Daniels slammed the NFL anthem protests, stating in a radio interview, “I will not stand by and see America insulted and belittled.”  http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/28/charlie-daniels-on-nfl-protests-i-will-not-stand-by-and-see-america-insulted-video/
you're a good huger who says that?
He always nails his interviews 50 Central
What song is that
50 wasn't about to say what cologne he had on cause he ain't with free advertising! Smart business man....
I wonder how the ladies would react to this man, if they had him on their show:  https://youtu.be/4i-6u_ZCKSY
I swear 50 ain't no fly guy.  But when he puts on clothes------
If you ask someone what their opinion in on a subject let them answer before pushing your own pathetic narrative lady. You're clearly one of those people who aren't accepting of other peoples view points.
@the view. You should have Brandon Tatum on your show... maybe get some common sense on your show. Whoopi i have always liked you...sister act and Ghost two of my favourite movies growing up but its sad to see how you are selling out our race. Democrats only care about black people to get our vote. The states that have the worst crime rates among blacks are Democratic states...Obama made things 10 times worse. You pushing the liberal agenda is not helping your community at all...trying to destroy trump is only destabilizing our country and driving everyone farther apart
Will he teach his son to IGNORE entirely the verb to be and mis-conjugate almost every word in the English language? He gonna do that?
i wonder if the white lady husband be hatin on guest like 50 cent
According to her career, Whoopi is the BUM.
Trump is Not anything by accident, he's a DEPLOYABLE by chose he was put in the WH with Vladimer Putin help NOT by accident ! Putin knew what he was doing and so did TRUMP! He was grinning from ear to hear all the time, he knew he didn't have a chance, toward the end you could see when he changed I guess he got word his buddy was going to help. He really started bullying folks in the public square, lying about Hilary Clinton, ripping her hard worked, hard earned lifetime reputation to bits with Putin's help! I hope it's provened what he's done with Putin's help and he's chased off the face of this Earth! Putin will continue to be Putin but there should NOT be room for Vladimer Putin or his partner in CRIME DONALD JUNE TRUMP in The USA!
Curtis James Jackson III is super amazing.. He's such a charismatic man! Sweat suits, hoodie, two piece with shoes, braces, No braces.. Yo, this brother is fine! Always the best to him and his family! Whoopi, go head mama!!
i like 50 but he probaly loves trump.. cant say it
It's Fiddy!
Whoopi 'it's not rape rape' goldburg
50 Cent has shot people before but never killed anyone. He was one of the biggest drug King Pins in Queens, NY at the age of 19 and had the whole hood where he’s from working for him.  And this is who black people look up to for 'fatherhood'.
haterssss
Those are not dreads , there just really tight Shirley temple curls!
Am I the only one who realized that they did not talk about 50's other son/children?
50 cent still looks the same after these years
50 cent was one of all time best rappers. from the 00s. one of my favorites.
Blondie wants that BBC.  Peep the body language 👀 🍫 🍆 her panties filled with lust 💦💦 #forbiddenfruit
Does anybody know what kind of training watch Sarah has on?
What song is at the beginning?
HEY WHOOPI I HEARD A GREAT MINISTER FROM MOBILE ALABAMA CALL HIM #45...THAT WAY WE ALL CAN CALL HIM HOW WE FEEL ABOUT HIM ..AFTER 45 COMES 46👊👊👊
did you catch the shade from Whoopi,..........you hear that ABC
why are you and other MSM outlets NOT reporting on this      https://youtu.be/FEbtrlYQuzk
This got me thinking: Are there things that I don’t like about America? Yes. Quite a few, in fact. Violence against the unborn, the highest violent crime rate in the industrialized world, sordid social agendas, the destruction of the family, high taxes and a creeping socialism are all high on my list. With these things in mind, perhaps I should take a knee, too? Maybe you have your own list of things you don’t like about America. Shall we all kneel and stick it to the man, as they say?No.The national anthem is about unity, not division. Think on the words. They tell of a perilous night through which a battle raged. Our nation was on the brink of extinction. When dawn finally came, the sun shone brightly on our tattered flag, giving proof to the fact that we had, indeed, survived as a nation. The story appeals to our better selves by reminding us that we are a people who unite and persevere through troubled times.By contrast, not only does Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem do nothing to advance the cause he advocates, it further divides an already deeply divided nation by unnecessarily offending and alienating people who are in no way guilty of the offenses he decries.
why did   the fat  one  wearing  the  blue   assume  he has  couple  of kids he  only  has  1
What's name of song he walk out on
You are more likely to be killed by aspirin then cops. Just saying. What a waste of energy
U Made It My Man......LOL
Addicted to POWER!! what a fucking good serie!! Well done!!
0:16 New 50 dropping soon 🔥 🔥 🔥
This guy supports Trump. You can feel it.
*50 can smash all them on stage even whoopi Goldberg lol*
I love Tiffany and 50’s face at the end of this clip is gold lol
If Trump is so sensitive about the Flag:\n\n--Why does Trump not show his tax returns of he is so devoted to the flag and America?  I mean he loves the flag and the country that deeply,  why not be open with the American public like all former Presidents did.\n\n--Why did Trump insult so many people under the American Flag, including veterans? \n\n--Why are so many in the Trump cabinet associated with Russia, if he loves the Flag and the country that much?\n\n--Why did Trump defend the KKK and neo-Nazi who he called  very fine people, while  they killed a woman and attacked clergies, the folks who defended the confederacy (traitors to America) and the confederacy flag (a flag appose to the American flag)? Yet, at the same time he was outraged about Anti Fascists (abolitionists). And he doubled down on them!\n\n--Why is Trump so concerned with a entertainment game?  And not with the 900.000 false arrested black lives that were made between 2007 and 2015 by NYPD? Or the 50% of exonerated black lives, because of false incarceration? Or the almost 90% of clearances of black lives in FBI stats? \n\nAll this happens under the American Flag. \n\n--Why is he not as concerned with the 3 million Americans at Puerto Rico who are without water and electricity, but instead spends his weekend tweeting about athletes who exercise their right???
Come on, Sunny!  What was the point of your question about Power, other than spoiling a major plot point from the finale?  That was a really dumb question that was super unnecessary.  I understand that the season ended a couple weeks ago, but there is a way to ask a question like that without naming the character or at least ask something interesting like how will that impact the characters and have you already starting working on the scripts for next season instead of asking if your going to bring the character back from the dead.  You're smarter than that girl!
gross
**Curtis RATSON!!!**
Lol. Dumb.
50 😍
50 a legend
Sunny ☀️ wants that BBC.
I
Love whoopi from iran
White Woman Love 50
No doubt.
I love 50. xoxo
Where's Ja?
Niggas
Making those forehead gains
the king
That's zaddy
https://youtu.be/TKZ2N8Hj-2c
This is such a stupid protest i swear to God what is wrong with you people?
Wait a minute,why they blocked out the conversation about Raina???
Trump is WEALTHIER then any of you will ever be, and The Worst President will ALWAYS be OBAMA the trader you all voted for JUST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK!!
The players that take a knee shouldn't be played - the NFL ratings have gone down - over 700 black people were killed last year by other black people however only 16 unarmed black people were killed by cops
I got here from watching NFL anthem protesters . Fuk these feminist hos especial the racist red head .
That black guy is dumber than a box of rocks...50 cent isnt very bright either.
Well here is a Great Look at FEMINISM, all of these rich women that hate and cant keep a man.
You liberals we gotta get rid of him lol 😂 stupid
This group has no Idea what the American flag stands for.\n www.youtube.com/edit?video_referrer=watch&video_id=fDDESRkAQlo
The Hollywood left, The MSM, College millennials, The NFL, ANTIFA, BLM, and the 65 million who voted for Hillary are echo chambers of themselves. They are heading down a path of self-destruction that they are too blind to see. If given good sound advice they just laugh in mockery. Their minds are too far deluded.
Just goes to show you, you can be a billionaire and a president and YET still be a big fat BUM!
So now the view has only one view....they call the President a bum....but we couldn't even mention anything about Obama.....that would have been racist, but when a black woman says things like Wooppie does it OK and not racist.....really ?
50 shouldn't be talking bout father hood when he not a father to his oldest
Did you know there are 1.8 billion Muslims in the world! Now that's a lot of pubey beards and crusty sandals!
you mean he is reproducing!   God help us!
The bum. in chief,  sounds great,lol
I think we should get rid of poopie Goldberg and 0 cents.
Did she say Bum in chief?
50 aint got no eyebrows
What an absolute wanker
What was the name of the Cologne 50 was wearing???
Why l dont like blacks
I'm a bit disappointed, he seemed bashful and out of place. I wanted to hear more from him. I wanted to hear him speak on serious issues, to know how intellectual he is...or isn't. I already know of his degree in pettiness and attacking trolls and other celebs on social media. Intellect is very attractive, not looks and smell good alone.
Ask an ape a serious question, and you get an ape level answer.
Hey Estee, I’m a 27 YO guy (probably not your usual demographic) and I randomly discovered one of your vlogs maybe 5 years ago during a break up. It was a rough patch for me, it really sucked. Your videos helped and they were a great distraction. When the pain of the break up finally passed, the love of your videos remained! You, Aslan and Reggie became a part of my morning routine. I feel like I’ve seen you and your channels grow, and I’ve grown up with you too. I’ve travelled so much the last few years and I think your travelling videos are to thank for it, keeping me motivated to see as much of the world as I can. I even introduced my new girlfriend to your videos and we watch them together as often as you upload haha! I’ve just listened to your first podcast and I love this new direction. I wish you all the best and good luck. Anyway, just wanted to pass on some love!
It is great to understand what happens in the background & who is working (which roles) in order to get a podcast. Thanks!
I was smiling so hard watching this!! So nice to see how it's like behind the scenes :D wishing you lots of success! Excited for the Mum episode!
sooo proud of you estee!!! can't wait to see you grow even more!
Hey Estee, I love your podcasts and your more serious side! Don't get me wrong, makeup and beauty are awesome but it's great to know there's so much more to you. And the podcasts are really well produced as well (shoutout to the team), I SO look forward to hearing more! Subscribed already, keep it up!
YES GIRL! x
So awesome! you look so happy!
No! You weren't lucky to win! You won because you were the best. Girls! Don't be afraid of your own success!
The recording room definitely makes a difference!! Totally heard the quality change once you walked into the room and at the outro. I’ve never been a big podcast listener but I listen to a lot of NPR so I feel like I’m properly prepped to delve into yours! 💕
Love it!! 💕
Hi Estée this is great!!!!! Also I'm drunk and I love yooooooUUU

Thank you for using your platform in a meaningful way, Estee! It's been incredible to watch you evolve from makeup tutorial and clothing haul videos to this beautiful podcast!

All women sound studio? Sooooo cool, congrats, estee, good choice!

Congratulations on the new podcast! I already love what you and Aslan are doing with the current affairs videos, so I'm really looking forward to diving into this. It's very exciting to see how you and your content are evolving. I've been watching you and other lifestyle YouTubers for years and honestly, these days, my subscription list is looking stale/repetitive (not another PR unboxing!). Thank you for being so brave and pushing yourself to create new kinds of content as you and your viewers mature. Sending my love from Singapore!

The team looks amazing and you've definitely done really good job with the first two episodes.

Almost thought you were being PUNKED! Lol Wow what a great product.
im not okay... she is my favorite
tj max has some makeup you should do a tryout on their products
Hi so I'm new to makeup and I was wondering if you could a video about what to have in your make up bag. Or like the necessary brushes and palettes one should always have when doing makeup. Thanks in advance!!
can you do the eye look you did for the fenty review i know it's so simple but i want to know exactly how you did it !!❤️
YASS girl but about the brush you ended up using? Inquiring minds want to know!
if u don't want the dark one can i have it?
I loved it when you spoke German 😅 wunderschön 😍
hiii dear im new subscriber  your channel....im watching your videos and i love it....you are awesome....like a doll im big fan of yours...love you👍❤😊
I feel like this product was meant to be used in a way to feign natural brow hair and draw short strokes as if you are drawing on individual hair rather than outlining and filling the area in like with a powder product
Awe. I thought it was so sweet when you were talking about PatrickStarrr. 🤗
I've been staring at your lipgloss!
I don’t understand why everyone love this product because I hate it , it totally doesn’t work
Your top 😍😍😍 where is that from omg *heavy breathing*

PLEASE DO THE INVERTED MAKEUP CHALLENGE!!!!❤️❤️❤️

Shook. Just. Shook
I NEED THIS PRODUCT NOOOWWW!!!!!!!!!!
What a blessing
i’m shooketh
Let's get me to 100subs
When Nikki Said Where Was This During High School For P.E. I Died 😂👏🏻 I Was Like That Too. I Always Hated When My Brows Was Gone After P.E. and I Had P.E. In a The Morning. Nikki I Feel You 😜🤤
Wunderschön😂❤
Loved the video on the brows !! You are so animated 😂😂
I play soccer and do wrestling, I use Elf eyebrow gel and like the powder duo, I swear and while my face and they literally stay on
I love how many times she went back in to remove because she couldn’t believe it 😂😂😂😂😂
what brush do you use to apply highlighter?
this really freaked me out because my mom sells the wunderbrow on HSN and i showed her this video today and right when i showed her this you went on hsn selling your lip and highlighter products!!!!
she literally DRENCHED that spray on her😂😂
😉 Amazing! I need this for my full and sparse brows!
I want to know how you remove the product 😂🙈
u make me cringe HARD
aids shot. 2nd time tonight that scatch puuk noise
GURRRRRRRLLLL YOU ARE TOOOO CUTE...Glad you were in my reccomendations!!!!😄😍🤗🤗
I'm not a fan of drawing brows on, it seems super unnatural to me but I have to say I really dig your videos and I'm laughing here :D Love your style. And of course, you have talent. I can't even do my liner.
Been using it for a year, and has never done me wrong
his would be beautiful as a more natural brow. i mean these kind of brows are okay but i’m really tired of these instagram makeup looks.
I've been using this for about 6 months, it's amazing isn't It!❤
Thank You so much for talking German, You are wunderschön 💕
I genuinely thought you were gonna cry at one point 😂😂
What is on your lips. I need to know.
i love wunderbrow, i'm a college kid with early morning classes and any step i can take to make getting ready in the morning a bit faster is so helpful. i just use wunderbrow every few days and wake up with perfect brows every morning
I I need a minute i'm not ok ahahahahaha awesome
You gotta do a full face of mac lipsticks!! 😍
@NikkieTutorials Why don't you get them microblade?! It's more natural looking than filling in. I did it and I'm obsessed. So great to wake up in the morning with a brow. You can still in to make darker if you want.
I personally hated this product. Took a long time to get used to applying it and using it has destroyed my eyebrows. Removal pulls the hair out. But I cried with laughter watching this video.
This was a fun video, great job.💜
My mom found that on Facebook and made me order it for her for like half a year then CVS started selling those! Now she has them microbladed so..🤣🤙🏻nice people are noticing it
Have these product for some month now and I freaking love it!!!! You have to use an oil-based makeup remover to take it off. The brand also came out with a maxy fully coverage foundation. I’m dying for you to test it out! It seems soooooo freaking good!!!!! Bisous de France!!!! 😽
😂😂😂 Your facial expressions when nothing comes off!\nI've been using Wunderbrow for over a year now and LOVE IT! Takes a bit getting used to because it's kind of a liquidy formula but it works like magic!\nYou should try their Wunder Extensions mascara (black and silver tube), it will blow your mind! 🙄💖
hey nikki u should try LMD makeup
❤️
Just be natural ffs
Oh my god wow
I hate mine lol
Hey, Tom, you know what really gets numbers on YouTube? Videos about financial minutiae. (Prof. Rouwenhorst is spectacularly overqualified for this interview; he's one of the world's leading experts on finance and financial history, and I'm really grateful he was able to take the time to talk about the original bond!)
They did default by devaluing the currency. Wasn't the currency backed by gold or silver? How much should the payments be today?
Does the Yale university have Yale locks ?
Awesome!! Can someone provide a link to the Water Board that is the issuer of the bond? I can't seem to find it on Google Search.
How to spot a Dutch person: they pronounce full as fool
That's pretty cool, i wonder who owns the bonds to all of America's debts..
This is really neat but its a bit of a waste honestly but neat non the less
Damn that's something I might not have known, cool.
Talk about a raw deal.
In only 500 years, someone might find the United States national debt interesting.
I thought this was Edd China's channel.
This is the sort of stuff i like to see trending on YouTube.
Britain has been sending a bill to the U.S. every year since 1773 for the tea that we threw into the harbor. Every year we disregard it and don’t pay it off
It may be the epitome of boredom to watch paint dry, but perhaps it would be less boring if it were drying for over 350 years.
Ok can we do this with national debt but forever?
Tom, you are close to 1,000,000 subscribers. With videos like this, you deserve every single one. Well done, Tom. Keep the great videos coming.
These are the things I'd be willing to pay for. That's just funny.
Dutch water authority goes to the bank We need a loan Have you taken out any loans in the past Well let me tell you a story...
I saw the 12th of January and thought ooh my birthday time to click 😂.
hey guys does anybody knows what is the video where tom talks about trumps winning elections (he said something about talking the elephant in the room i think)
If I saw Tom I would hug him so hardly <3
Will they cash in the bond?
All the old timers talk about inflation this, inflation that:  back in my day a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread cost me 5 cents So why did this bearer bond/perpetual bond never rise according to inflation?
When are they next paying. I wanna go. Let's have a party.
Yale has never had a problem propagating fraudulent legal contracts. It's the only way the truly useless in our society can feel as if they are contributing.
Why didn't they pay it all off ages ago, surely it's a lot more expensive to keep paying interest off forever?
The name is bond, James bond.
I love videos like this
I was expecting the bond to be worth millions 😂
Why was the interest payment lowered? Was it by the payer or the payee who decided that?
Is it still possible to trick someone into signing a perpetual bond?
While in New Haven, I hope you were able to take advantage of timing to learn about the City's green.  I sent you an email on it a while back.  Intriguing ownership and management of a public space. - and a neat place for a park bench episode.
Idk who this guy is but he looks like Jenna marbles on the thumbnail
plot twist. they pay interest for a Jew Banker
Does anyone reckon Tom Scott is obsessed with himself? Just go onto his YouTube channel page and count how many times you can see his face. Its actually quite disturbing.
I counted the singular or plural version of the word 'bond' 21 times in 3 minutes and 57 seconds.
Why won't the US government define that this paper doesn't have relevance anymore and the debt is considered paid already?
What was the interest payment value when it was issued?  1000 Euro equivalent?  367 years.  Now that's mind-blowing.
No Thames bond but there is a British consol (perpetual bond) that was issued to pay for war expenses during WWI and also some from the South Sea Bubble of 1720 that still pay regular interest. They are often mentioned in finance classes as they are a special case of present value calculations. When I was at MSU in the 1970's one of my Finance professors had a French Consol that had been issued to help Napoleon pay for his wars. Not sure if it was still paying interest or not.
This is why in the Abrahamic religion God forbade interest because it is an evil practice. The Jews came changed that all around and now it so wide spread in all its evil corrupt glory.
Perpetual interests are a sin.
i was like this guy is either Dutch or from Philly/P.burgh
paper itself is worth more than the amount in interest.
Things that make you go hmm? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the errors in the subtitles are funny.   levee is not the same as a levy.
I wish I could get as excited about anything as this guy is about financial history
I hate the idea of any debt so much I made some hard choices and sold some things and no longer have debt myself.
Laughing all the way to the levee.
Keeping the books straight and accounts up to date. That's how I like it.
Wow. How mind numbingly boring. I guess this is why accountants never get invited to parties. Except parties hosted by other accountants.
Did the Prof say what the history premium on the bond is?
But hang in dint these get adjusted for inflation aswell?
Awesome. What a piece of history!
1€ per month? That ain't too shabby for the money needed to build that dike thing!\nHypothetical scenario: Water authority says screw this, I want to keep my 12€. Yale (like he said, against all odds), sues them for the 12€ of interest.\nThey get laughed out of court.\n\nNos respice ad futurum.
€11 a year?? Might as well stick that up your arse.
Wish house loans were like this.  You'd have more generations of families living in the same home..
Me and my student loans
Sadly, had the bond been cashed in coin, the coins would be worth orders of magnitude more than the inflated paper you would get today.
3:20 but isn't suing someone america's favourite pastime?
Tom Scott, fab video really enjoyed it.
another channel that has a percentage of the followers it should have...
This just reminds me of Brady Haran's ridiculous £2 house payment.
Ahh, I love stuff like this! I've never watched a Tom Scott video and found it boring! Just wish there were more!
Technically the Euro is not the successor of the guilder but the replacement. The guilder is still governed by the Dutch Central Bank while the Euro is governed by the European Central Bank. Those currencies  have a fixed exchange rate of EUR 1 = NLG 2,20371. So there was not a lowering of the interest.\n\nAlso it seems the holder is responsible for collecting and that's only possible by showing the bond on sight. Which explains why their is not interest on back interest. (If it's booked off every year the waterboard might even collect a little interests. Which means Yale should pay the flight costs the Netherlands. Or more likely sent the bond with a professor on a congress or holiday in the Netherlands.\n\nAnd the Dutch Water Boards or Waterschappen are one of the oldest still working democratic government-institutions in the world. The central and provincial governments have had plans to take over their roles. But a 'living' document like this actually gives the Water Boards a legitimacy by seniority. And a lot of financial students in Yale will become acquainted with the Water Boards.
Why didn't I know you were coming to Yale! I go to school here!
You just didn't bother with trying to pronounce it correctly, did you?
So my dutch tax money goes partially to yale...\nHmmmm.... not to fond of that
It's very bizarre really, youd think the water board would buy the bond themselves and in effect nullify it. Whilst €13 euros isn't a lot, it's still taxpayers money, bare in mind the arrangements for preparing and paying invoices often outstrip the debts themselves - sometimes as much as €50. In this instance it's $1000s of dollars on plane flights and hospitality at the other end.. And if yale are paying that themselves, doesn't it do the paying students a discredit?
If youve got a social security or personal pin number, your born into the debt of your country.
Guilders already was obsolete currency. So isnt that mean this bond was already void???...
What...default the debt...dude they only pay like €11 a year....geez
Tom, you have the funnest videos
Are you still in debt for to your old hairdresser? That might explain why your sporting a hairstyle from the 90s!
I know one debt that still keeps paying. \n\nColonialism.
I am disappointed Tom Scott neglected to explicitly mention a pregnant point: governments that control their own currency can inflate their way out of debt. That is not financial minutia. It is a power that many in governments in Lisbon, Madrid, Dublin, and Athens likely miss dearly.
I wonder how long until they give up on that lettering system (aaaaaaa, bbbbbbb, ...) and just switch to spreadsheet-style lettering (fa, fb, ..., ga, ..., ).
Skyrim ledgers ?
How did i end up here? Hey, a topic about a place I can walk to. I pay this 'company' the interest of this bond a month.
People are awesome!
Trump's wall?
James Bond.
English invaders.
capitalism boys
lannisters always pay their debts
really cool
Tyler Durden dislike this
Hey Tom
Cool
Did he say lecduck beuvendams?
Hahahah Why is the so awesome?
Amazing!!
Very smile worthy history
Top quality Tom Scott.
Student loan joke! Ha! I'm orignal!
(((juice)))
Nice history.
A Lekdijk always pays his debts!
I love his voice.. it sounds like a young pre-puberty virgin boys voice which is so innocent to listen too...
also, did you know that people from phoenix are called phoenicians?

Galatasaray lı olarak helal olsun Beşiktaş iyi sokmussunuz xd
yalnız spiker ilk golü ıkınarak söyledi... donu dolmuş olabilir..
2-0 'dan sonra spikerin bu iş bitti demesi çok hatalı. Maç bitmeden büyük konuşmamak lazım.
hakem çok iyiydi adam gibi bir hakem görmeyeli çok olmuştu

Monaco yu da yen beşiktaş
bu galibiyet orospu cimbomlu ile çocuğu fenerliye girsin en çok
yine beşiktaş yine ışıkların kapatılması ve yine beşiktaş ın galibiyeti güzel taktik bravo trafocular
Besiktasin rakiplerini turkiyenin herhangi takimi da yenebilir sansli besiktas \n.
Kazandilar da futbolu zevk vermiyor. Coban gibi top yere inmedi, akilli bir atak yapamiyorlar, topu tepip durdular. Biraz daha iyi takim gelse dagticak bunlari. Mesela Galatasaray UEFA kazandigi zaman futbol oyniyorlardi, uc pasla kaleye gidiyorlardi

Radio City seats secured!!!
he is baaaaack!!!
Chulada...!
God forbid an artist tries to explore something new, or do you want that same old song again and again every single time.
Ripping stuff off for a change 🙄
Just bought my ticket for his Belfast gig! Can't wait to see Noel again!
he escuchado ésto unas 30 veces... me muero por escucharlo.
Un poco de todo:\n·) Las imágenes me recuerdan a la portada Dig Out your Soul y eso está genial..!\n·) ¿Por qué la gente todavía intenta encontrar el sonido de Oasis en su proyecto solitario? No sean tercos!\n.) Es sólo un adelanto de todo lo que se viene en el nuevo álbum! No es una canción oficial. Acaso no notan que es un remix de canciones que se están por venir e incluye los respectivos títulos de las canciones. Cada vez falta menos...
Suddenly I'm aligned, refreshed, healed, living my best life. Thanks Noel! I knew I needed somethin!
I imagine after the you gotta get yourself together we get a whooooooo built the moon.
got some sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band vibe
HOLY SH***************T!!!!!!! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME!!!!! SO THE NEW ALBUM CAME TRUE!!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR SUCH GREAT MUSIC!!!!!!!! IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT YOU RELEASE NEW ALBUM, I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT!!!!!!
It this Noel Gallagher HFB Feat Brandon Flowers? Bc at 1:20 the voice sound like Brandon. lol
If you're not doing something different, then you're not doing anything at all. That quote, said by the man who started the career of about 10 rock n roll legends should be heard by the Lennon tribute artist formerly known as Liam Gallagher.
WTF is this!!! ... come on Noel stick to some awesome ROCK N ROLL .... Too many years in London ... come back to Manchester and learn your roots and where you came from!!!
sounds different.. looking forward to it..sounds like a rock/electronica mix.....hints of primal scream..
Any idea when the first single will be on the radio?
When you dropping a single or two
1:00-1:05 sounds like All I Can Think About Is You by Coldplay....
Been hanging around with Damon too much rkid
Sounds like a really bad Super Furry Animals cover band.
Good Christ! noel's had a fucking relapse
I'm not overly impressed but I could never click dislike on anything done by NG. 👎🏻
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN ON THE LSD TABS!!!
started off a bit cotton eye joe then went tame impala echo bunnymen jesus mary chain
0:58 is giving me psychedelic Eleanor Rigby/I am the walrus vibes
Name of the first song, please???
I guess this is what happens when you start hanging out with Damon Albarn.
good sounding spacey tunes, Noel's back-up vocals are good.  Can't wait to hear the final cuts with Liam's awesome lead vox!
Hope that fucking alarm clock doesn't make it on to the record.
gonna have to pull 1 out the bag \nto beat Liams For What its worth
sounds like blonde, u2,chemical brother's, etc,Original? sounds like a dance band with noel singing, could he sing it live?
This is fucking amazing.\n\nIs this the chemical brothers back in with noel again??
PISH
as you werent AHRE
tame impala
What's this shit?!? Omg...
Failed Moby multi add campaign !!\nOh lawdy !!
just fucking terrible, like soda pop commercials, just crap
OMG
Wtf
KD OS BR?
This is mega!!! It sounds even better than last two great albums and it's fuckin unique
Where is the single?!
Holy shit Noel, these sound good so far!
Being a huge fucking oasis fan, this won’t even compare to his previous albums. If the album follows this theme, could be a disappointment. However it could be a Piece of genius, we are yet to find out
finally leaving his safe place and I love it.
Really dig where Noel's taken his music! Oasis was the paradigm shift in my taste in music, it's what made it improve haha..and things haven't been the same since. Can't wait to see you live in NYC!!
YEAH-ah! I always wanted this Bloody fucking good day-!
Ok. Stop the world. We need Liam and Noel together again! We need ROCK again!
Omg I didn't like that I am gutted 😭😭😭😭
Zโครตเจ๋งเลยผลงานของสองพี่น้อง มีอะไรแปลกๆตลอดไม่เรยหยุดนิ่ง
Cannot fookin wait.
HES HAVING A BEADY EYE MOMENT FOR FUCKS SAKE
Twice ive watched this with headphones  and twice i looked up thinking a plane was about to bomb us 😅.. searching the sky an everything ... took me a few seconds to realise it was the first 30 seconds of this vid 🤔 thick \n\nSounds great !
Love both Liam and Noel (they're best together), but I'm pretty sure that Noel will release a much better album than Liam in terms of musical quality and durability. \n\nNoel is the musician of the two, and that is so very obvious in everything that they have released since Oasis split. Noel writes songs that growes on you and lasts for years. He has written the soundtrack of a generation. \n\nLiam clearly does'nt have this capability. Instead his songs tend to be those kind of songs you play a couple of times, and then forget. You might get amused there and then, but it isn't enough there to make you wanna come back and play the album over and over to discover elements you failed to notice the first two spins. The songs are short lived, and this is Liam's biggest problem. The lack of this song writing abilities is the main reason why Liam never will make an album that you pick up in 20 years and remember as the soundtrack of your best times. \n\nLiam is the performer, and a damn good one. But he needs Noel's songs. A proper rock n' roll star should sing the best anthems, not mediocer and forgetable fillers.
The Chief has returned,cannot wait for this to be released.\n\nAs to who built the moon...it was Keith Richards. He made everything.
Liam vs Noel
I came from the Liam Gallagher - Greedy Soul Live At Air Studios song and now i'm listening this and shit... both are fucking amazing :O
Cannot wait!
Potato vs goat
드디어 치프께서 앨범을 내신다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Todo lo que haga Noel está bién! Me gusta suena bién
Oh dear me.
Biblical?
Can I downlaod now?
NOEL GODLLAGHER IS BACK
Psychedelic as fuck! Pink Floyd influence?
Esa tipografía como de Bob Esponja tho
EVERYBODY JUST FUCKING CALM DOWN
Sounds Immense!
GENIAAAAAAAAAAL !!!!!! \nGREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤👏
Pinche Liam ni las manos va a meter !!! Qué culo Noel te hubieras esperado 6 meses mínimo
love you
Tremendo! Parece que va a tener mucha psychodelia y post punk. Hay mucho de The Charlatans, Happy Mondays, New Order. Genial le tengo fe
Well done NG. A change is good. I don’t understand why people want him to keep churning out middle of the road shite.
Very promising. He needed something different after all these years, this sounds great.
Greedy Soul viewed 152k times in two days, plus 62k more on Jools. This struggles with 234k views in five days.Do the math kids. Noel's nervous, coz Liam's going toe to toe@!!@
Love Noel Gallagher, but that sounded absolutely terrible.
The Gallaghers went full pop.
I’ve not doubt this will be classic Noel but I’m looking forward to Liams more. Lyrically its as if Noel wrote Liams and Liams wrote this: \n\nWe got to get ourselves together. x10
I built the Moon!
Just got a feeling it's gonna be one of those annoying albums after a while 😂
I'm a huge fan of Noel, but this sounds terrible.  Is this a 70s dance pop record!?  An admirable but mistaken attempt.
I hope amorphous androgynous sue the shit out of Noel for this
To be quite honest with you Noel, I'd wish nobody buy your solo's career albums, first of all 'cos they're $hi%, sound like a big pile of $hi% and second 'cos if ppl still buy those album there will be no oasis reunion at all 'cos you don't really need any money nowaydays aren't ya. I like a few songs from your solo career but not as much I do like the entire oasis discography. Music taste is subjetive, you don't give a ##uck what ppl think... as long as they buy your music of course =)
A shit
verybeige
U2 Zooropa with Hooky on Bass..................\n\nOh & guess what......Paul Wellers on it too...........Fuckin Surprise, Surprise Eh????\n\nNoel Gallagher????.................As you Fuckin Weren't.................
Shite
This sounds wrong.
Well no wonder liam does want anything to do with this crap hope that’s not the best track think big brother need liam
I think of all the plaid blazers #2 is best!\nI'm a big believer in waiting for the right piece though, so if you don't LOVE any of them, return them and wait for the one 😊\nThat black coat is LOVELY though!\nLove your channel ❤️
Literally all youtubers and Instagrammers look the exact same now: check blazer, slogan tee, the same necklace, same haircut.
The black coat suits you perfectly and paired with the plaid scarf 👌🏻, but the plaid blazers are a no, they doesnt fit nice so why keep them?
Challenge idea - no shopping for home wear and clothes for a MONTH!
I actually gasped when I saw you in the floral print midi dress! You looked so beautiful and pairing it with the black boots was such a great choice. 💓
Dont like any of the blazers! They dont sit right
Not sure if you made your decision yet but I think none of the blazers and jackets looked good on you EXCEPT for the long black coat. The blazers hide your shape and looks too big on you.

❤️💋 I create makeup looks ➡️ https://www.instagram.com/beauty_by_mia/ 🙏🌸✨ \nTake a look and we can talk about all things makeup and beauty. We can share our passion for makeup 💋
I really love the black jacket you got! It's something different but still very elegant and classic-looking. The boots are also super pretty!
The lace jumper is sold out :(  - it's lovely!
loooove your lipstick, the color is so dreamy 😍
YOU ARE SOOOO PRETTY.
The jackets are horrible!! Terribly unflattering too
I love Zara. It is affordable and very nice. Great video x
Zara has been awesome lately.
That's not houndstooth.. that's plaid.
Lovely haul!! ❤️❤️ Xx
😍😍😍😍😍more hauls pls
I got the black coat... love it x
This is the first video I've seen from you and I immediately clicked the subscribe button. Love the way you talk, great video, cute dog, and you're so beautiful as well. Just love your channel overall ❤️💃🏻
Plaid is already being so overdone! Everyone and their mum has one now, keep it more classic and less heavily trend based and keep the coat, return the blazers.
Great; you and practically every other Youtuber will look the same.  You are all buying the same clothes, talking about the same outfits you will wear.
That's not houndstooth. It's glen plaid. I love everything in your haul especially the embellished shoes.
It is a prince of wales tweed print, not houndstooth :)
Haha yesterday I tried on the same 3 checked blazers!! What a coincidence. I bought the last one you tried on, the longer one, I think It was the most flattering one. And also this bag: 8065/204, a bit expensive but is gooorgeous
I like the first blazer much more, it looks so high quality
I hope you mention the sizes of each item for reference.😩
KEEP FIRST BLAZER AND BLACK COAT
i cant find the houndstooth scarf!! ITS SO NICE :(
I just love Fall everything!🍁🎃💕 Just a thought if you like the first plaid jacket, you could see a tailor to ask if the shoulder pads could be removed. I really loved the red accent in the plaid.
The shoes would look great with a plaid blazer and jeans :)
Black coat with the plaid scarf gets my vote!
Love the black One! Return the plaid ones :)
The photo set is really beautiful!🦄
Keep the longer brown plaid blazer/coat!
Love the black coat and the second blazer is the best, but it doesn't fit perfectly so I would look for another one elsewhere.
The first brownish blazer fits you more!! Keep it.
I am obsessed with houndstooth and check prints too. My fave fit is the 2nd of the two blazers. They do seem to have quite a bit of material at the front though but I still love it xx
Very nice! I'd love to see more styling/outfit videos! I really like your style and how you wear pieces together! Some autumn/winter outfit inspiration please! ❤️
I prefer the second blazer
I love your ankle boots! I've been on the hunt for a new pair for a while now, they're the only thing I wear in Autumn x
I think your right about the first blazer.  The second short blazer is much better!
I´ve actually tried the second blazer you showed in the store and I loved it! It's definitely on my wishlist (along with a million other things of course!) I say keep that one and return the other ones, I assume you don't need all of them as they are so similar.
Oooh Zara is 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 this AW. Loving the dress on you, all the knitwear you bought (and the jumper you’re wearing!) and the Black coat looks amazing on you ❤️
Does she live with her bf?
Love the boots! I tried the exact ones in my shopping video in zara on my channel Check it out if interested!
I love Zara at this time of year! xxx
It's really difficult to tell the fit without the jackets/coats buttoned properly. But going from them hanging open, I vote to keep the black coat and send the rest back. If, however, the black coat pulls or bunches anywhere when properly buttoned, send it back too!
I think the favorite piece has to be those shoes !!
Ditch all the plaid coats :( They look dumpy and frumpy, which is so not you. The black coat is heaven on you though-- you look beautiful in it, long and lean. The plaid scarf and embellished loafers are lovely, too.
Alix, that black coat is gorgeous on you! And I actually really like the second checkered blazer that you tried on. Didn't notice the double breasted excess fabric situation until you did, but it seems like a nice updated-vintage trend piece. Decisions, decisions!
Maybe return all the plaid blazers and buy another on that fits better. I saw a long plaid trench from Topshop.
The black coat is stunning on you. Love it, x
I don't enjoy winter but everytime I watch your videos O want the weather to be cold because all your room looks so cozy and your sweaters 💓
If you like the first blazer better but don't care for the shoulder pads....you can just remove them.  It's very easy to do.
The black coat is perfect on you! Love all the plaid blazers but for some reason the cut is not right. Love all the shoes. Picture those studded loafers with jeans and a black high neck sweater!!! Fabulous!!!!\nKellie
The shoulder pads can be removed~it looks great on you.
Obsessed with the checked blazer keep it. Return the striped jumper
i fid it so hard to relate to a lot of youtubers but you are so  lovely, so pretty and got a really good figure!! have a wonderful week! xo
The dress is absolutely stunning on you!!
Can you please link the brown coat from Zara?
Every time you do a clothing haul I buy something 😆
Fall officially started on September 22nd! So technically it's here!
What are you wearing on your lips Alix? LOVE the colour!
It's still 90 something where I am and just seeing her wear the sweater make me feel hotter😂
I prefer the first plaid blazer
Ahh I love all of the knits and the blazers! Sound quality is fab btw 👌🏻
I like the idea of the first blazer, but just think the fit  makes it look a bit masculine and not in the cool boyfriend fit way! You look great in blazers in general but I think that bold prints/colours look the best on you! 💕
Your makeup is always on point in every video 😍
I'm for the first blazer! I think it's gorgeous and fits you well. Remember you can always cut out the shoulder pads - I've done that before and had quite a good wear out of the items ;)
I love both double breasted jackets! Definitely keep them xox
I remember that you have tried The first line top in your last Vlogs video right? \nAt that time ,I thought it was pretty good in your body. Lol\n\nAnd one question, do you roll your hair everyday?
Hi Alix, weird question - how did you fit your tripod into the space between the chair you're sitting on and the bed? I noticed in the try on clips and wondered as I've been struggling to film in my small bedroom. Thanks so much💕
I prefer the last plaid coat on you! with black jeans, boots and a nice scarf it would work really well.\nZara has so many gorgeous pieces this season! and that long black coat is a winner!!
I love the lipstick your wearing, what is it? 💕
Hi Alix,  where are your sock boots from? looked really chick.
I haven't been to Zara in a while but know I need to do this pronto ! Would love if you could check out my Disney world channel xxx
Not feeling the blazers love
You look frumpy and bigger with those plaid/houndstooth blazers. Return them ASAP, they just don't suit you. Love the black coat though!
Please please please can someone tell me where those sock boots are from!!
Can we talk about how much she looks like Leighton Meester?
I'd recommend just buying a pair of Docs and then you're covered for several winters! I live in mine all year round.
The black coaaat!! Did not fall.in love.with none of the plaid coats/blazers. You will definitely find something.better within the season
The midi dress would look so good during the thanksgiving season 😍
That silver studded shoes is just so bold and i think it’s a perfect statement piece. Ps: all the stuffs you got are so fall ready and i think i need to go to zara soon ;’)
That dress looks absolutely gorgeous, I'm obsessed. X
The slightly  oversized Blazers are everywhere. Classic black, a good investment.
gosh! watching these videos shows me how bad I am at shopping and choosing clothes!! for example if I saw that dress i would never have picked it up or tried it on ... i wouldn't even cast a second glance at it, but now that I actually see how it looks like on ....I'm dying over it. I actually think I'm gonna go pick one up tomorrow.
Blazer nr 2 and the black coat 👌🏼
The midi dress makes you look like Adele 😍😍
Not a fan of any of the plaid. Otherwise, really nice picks (the dress was gorgeous on and the black coat looked great like - perfect winter staple as you said).
Didn't you just clear out your wardrobe very recently? LOL \nAnyway, the 1st plaid blazer and the plaid coat don't look very good. The 2nd blazer is cute. Love the pattern. The black coat is amazing.\nThe 2nd pair of shoes looks horrible to me 😂
Where is that third part of the makeup declutter 😄 I cant wait
Stop looking down at your screen!
Not sure when this was filmed but it is autumn 😳
The shoes, I wanna cuddle with them 💖
Am I the only one that hated everything ? The chelsea boots are ok but I would've waited for the sale.
IT'S NOT HOUNDSTOOTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's plaid. Different types of plaid.
Plaid? Tartan is the word you're looking for.
*Incredible*

If only harambe was here to see this amazing masterpiece.. :(
🐍❤️
If you can make a friend with a snake then you can make a friend with anyone. He must be a really nice and humble person.
I wonder how many people saw this and tried to friend a wild snake and got bitten ?
That's the old man from Scooby Doo.
Not fond of snakes, but charming video.
He sounds like Herbert the pervert on Family guy. Lol
Don't blame the person fishing there if they kill the thing from freaking out once the snake pulls up to eat their bait.
I am traumatized for life I need a therapy dog after seeing this I mean a snake crawling over my pants that would be the worst nightmare ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!
What!!!! How in the world did he even get a wild snake to do that. I can't even get squirrels to come near me.
Why on earth would anyone dislike this? Other to than to be a full time useless internet troll
O wow, you are one brave fella, that is awesome.
What a kind man. Salute! 💕
That's not a perch, cool though
Its fun but still give a goosebumps
Im suprised the gravitational pull from the the size of his testicles did not cause mass flooding throughout the area
do I still need to tape up my britches if I already have a big snake in there
love videos like this. Gives me hope that animals can still forgive us and love is still between man and animal . It also proves how highly intelligent these animals are .
Old people on phones be like “I hope I got that” 😂😬
The mans accent made me explode in cuteness
Sir thank you for not being a typical human and thinking the only good snake is a dead snake.
I always felt that I would die from fright if I saw a snake up front, but this sweet guy makes me a little less afraid (only if I knew it wasn't venomous)😊
when he turns the camera around, chris from family guy is tied down with his ass up
Dude, your balls are way bigger than mine!!! Right on!!! I think that snakes in love!!!
The snake just saw a big heat source. She probably realized who he was after she sented the air
The way this gentlemen is able to bridge the gap and interact with a wild snake is so cool. He seems like such a sweet man and the snake was just as friendly as can be.
What an IDIOT! !!! When animals are shy towards humans, There's less of a chance for them to attack us!!! But, when they lose that fear, then that's when they become dangerous! !!!
Amazing to be the same at 79
Is that a Diamond back/banded water snake?? We have those all over our pond in Texas. Very docile snakes. It seems people do get these mixed up with cotton mouths and end up killing them:( Anyways loved the video!!
Thats just creepy ,not fan if snakes and csnt understand why folk kerp them as  pets .
I normally am terrified of snakes. But this snake peeked its head up like Hey, who are- Hey it's you! Long time no see!
Thanks for helping the snakes man
LOL both the man and snake are cute
a man make it to 79 years old to upload the best video on the internet, congrats
He prob from Texas like me
Wow! That trust with wild mammals is surprising. From reptiles... miraculous?
I love snakes but I would be scared if my mom caught me fucking my pillows at night while I drink a red bull
Normally I'm smiling at the cute animals and marveling at their intelligence, or their level of compassion, but here, not only am I smiling at both of those at once, but at that happy old man just enjoying life with the animals. Reminds me so much of my great grandmother and her dog Scooter, it brings tears to my eyes.
Not all people will be so friendly....
Awww, the snake trusted you and be good friends. I love your story, thanks to share it . :-D
Wise as a serpent,\nGentle as a dove
snakes' lives matter.  that is cool!!!
poor old nice man, the only friend he has is a water snake.....
I can honestly say that's pretty awesome for you. Although I wouldn't have the guts to let one crawl up me. They freak me out. Haha. I'm a wuss around snakes. Haha
I don't want one of them up in my britches!
I like that this guy was careful n respectful. I hope the rest of the snakes he sees are nice too 🐍 🐍 🐍
Cool!!!! You are a very kind person!!!! I am glad that I got to see this video. Thank you for sharing.
Give a snek a feesh and she'll be full for one day. Teach a snek to feesh and she'll be full her entire life. :3
Sir.. I just gotta say,  you're awsome!!
I love his accent
Aww, he sounds like such a sweetheart. I'm glad he enjoyed his day.
I already have one in my britches and don't need another.
Great video ! ..but i still hate snakes.
The world needs more people like this man.
I love this channel for it promotes love for animals from all kinds ....but fish are animals too and they deserve to live as much as we and other animals do
He sounds so sweet and pure.
I like this it’s very good
I rescued a baby garter snake from the neighbour's cat yesterday ... non- venomous snakes are great ....... not so crazy about the venomous ones though !
NO NO NO NO NO, you people got it wrong. This particular snake is a Diamondback Water snake -- not to be confused with the Diamondback Rattlesnake. Water snakes are incredibly ballsy, especially when you have fish. Plenty of fishing stories of water snakes coming right on shore to steal a freshly caught fish.
Snake is a snake...like the story says, after biten, the snake replies...you knew I was a snake.
wow! that was amazing.🐍  what a sweet man 💞😊😊😊😊
That was very cool
My snake's already in my breeches!
Did u named the snake yet??
this was so nice to see.......man comuning with nature, instead of trying to kill it!!!  you are awesome!!!!!!!!!
Is that Tim Jones???? I know him!
You sir are a legend mate\n:D
He has more Balls than me, people would of mistaken me for a screaming lady in need of help.
Better you than me 😬
Honestly.... I don't care what kind of creature it is as long as a good attitude is there...
Hahaha awesome video.
Heart warming
u r nuts
That. Was. Horrible.
Awesome!
Snake scuad where u at
Braver man then i
This guy's awesome
00:49 We love you Grandpa!

Never trust a serpent
Sounds like Herbert The Pervert
Wow what a wild  rare pet hehe.

Gay is not okay

,cc!
wow.. huge balls
That's crazy !!
Adorable old timer and snake good video
thanksssssss
Should not laugh but oh boy it's so funny. On a serious note though, the teacher was wrong to sit on the car's bonnet.
Teacher should not have sat on bonnet.. but thats not an excuse to  drive through him!..  He should have been reported not transported!!!..
Teacher acting unprofessional by sitting on someone's property = frustration and retaliation= a sore arse !!
Sitting on the bonnet of someone's car is just asking for trouble. A quick reverse would have had the same effect. But we don't think straight when we see red do we!
My sympathy was for the Teacher, but when I saw that he sat on the bonnet, that sympathy diminished, no need to be that arrogant.
Teacher isn’t going to do that again, lesson learnt !
The driver should have quickly reversed instead.
Teacher got what he deserved
Ive  just seen this on the news! Have they pressed charges against the teacher yet? This is an act of aggression. If he got out and pushed him he would be in the wrong! Try sitting on a police car and see what happens!
Teacher was in Passive Mode (  Noob )
Haha stupid cunt of a teacher. Arrogant cunt got what he deserved.
Those two kids witnessed a crime lmao hope the driver of that Volkswagen loses his licence
Hahaha that’s funny!!! But why did the so-called responsible teacher sit on the mans bonnet??? Surely he knew that would only exacerbate the situation.
Hahaha, id have done the same if he'd sat on my car. Prick.
Why you sitting on someone's bonnet if I am the driver I do the same
He is my science teacher and he did that because your not allowed to park in there
Mr McCarthy in the Winston school he is a sciance teacher
guys u may not belive me but he is my physics teacher and i am not even lying. He didnt sit on the car, the car went forward a bit and then he drove off. he is my gcse physics teacher belive me
There are thousands of arseholes on youtube blaming the teacher.\n\nTry watching the video in a full screen.  The car is rolling forward.  The teacher falls onto the bonnet.  His feet leave the ground for less than a second.  Insufficient time to take his hands out of his pockets and regain his balance, before the criminal accelerates and causes GBH.\n\nEvery action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Explain to me the effect of a one and a half tonnes car rolling in to you?????  Would you fall on to the bonnet?????  How long would it take for you to get off?????\n\nPersonally I have less faith in drivers.  I would not stand in front of an irate driver and turn my back on them.  Is the naive teacher in the wrong?  ABSOLUTELY NOT
Lmao that's my teach Mr.McCarthy XD\nAs you can see, Winston is a great school. That's why I wish I moved from the USA to England sooner :D
stop attacking the teacher- the driver could've killed him whether he sat or not- also, if he just stood there, the driver would've ran him over, so sitting on it made it less painful for him.\nalso, at least sympathise with the teacher, his mum died in the same week as this event and recently his dad did too- do you have no love??
He shudda reversed and made him fall flat on arse
I was more concerned about the two kids on their bikes who nearly got ran over by that ass hole
Hi Mate could you give Me a lift to the bottom on the drive!!!!! Yeah Mate SIT on my bonnet an I'll take you there, Just wait a min................. WHAYHAY what a ride OR was that just me with that VID??????? LMFAO BUT that said he did wrong and poss hurt the children
Fair enough that the teacher won´t allow him to pass. But you sit on my car and I will fuck you up. It´s as simple as that.
Move please?!\nBugger off!\nWhy?!\nDo you know who I am?!\nWho the hell are you?!\nI'm Ronnie Pickering !!\nWho??\nRonnie Pickering!!\nWho?!\nRONNIE PICKERING!!
Holy shit everyone in the comments is so serious, lighten up I found this funny as shit
Hilarious! The best laff I've had in ages!!!!!!!
Funniest thing ever imagine being one of them kids on the bikes  😂😂😂😂
Whether the teacher sat on the bonnet of the car or not is totally irrelevant, the driver was trying to drive through the staff car park as he was too bloody bone idle to use public roads to turn around. So wants to speed through a car park where children are walking. A total danger to society, 22 and in prison. I suspect he will be returning there often throughout his life.
If the teacher had the audacity to sit on my bonnet id fucking give him a test drive too..
Good they shud have reversed and drove over the twat
Doesn't take long for clips to be stolen does it
If the car park is off limits, why not just put a gate on, rather than just having ferris bueler's teacher guarding like some kind of traffic control cunt?
Teacher is a cunt. \nKid that watches then gets on his bike and fucks off is cool 😎😎
Serve the jobs worth right😂😂
Humans are garbage. This video is the proof.
Stupid fucking teacher, he looked like a right wolly car surfing
Don't sit on his fucking car then! Cheeky twat deserved it.
For those people denying the fact that the teacher didn't deliberately sit on the car (which it clearly shows in the footage) but the car nudged him on the bonnet. You are delusional fucks that deny the truth and have never owned a fucking car
He'd have gotten the same if he sat on my car's bonnet
Should’ve driven straight into a wall.
He sat on the mans hood .fuk id have .thrown him off my car too then stopped and whipped his stupid ass.
Both are to blame, but the teacher should never have done that in the first place. Should have just let the car in the car park, then ask them to leave once off the main road and not obstructing traffic. Trying to be clever has cost him, could have had a nasty accident if he fell the wrong way too!
the description on this video is very inaccurate... The teacher actually sat on the bonnet of the car, Which in no doubt would have angered any motorist. Serves the teacher right for trying to be really cocky!!
This is my school😂
If the driver waited for traffic to pass and reversed, the teacher would of slid off his bonnet and landed on his ass, especially as he had his hands in his pockets. Not a very good teacher sitting on someone else's car. The car had no insurance or mot and if he did that, I doubt the car driver would of been arrested and jailed.
LOOOL
✔
LOL
guys look slowly the car is going slowly and sir loses balance so he sits on it and a school policy is not to let cars in otherwise there would be thousands of cars and if a kid gets hit the school would be deemed unponsable and closed so look over this one more time 😉
Absolutely hilarious that!
Dramatic footage\nFuck off will yah
I have no problem with the teacher sitting on the bonnet of the car, too many people think they can park and drive anywhere they like. I see this on a daily basis outside our child's school, drivers who don't give a shit and will park anywhere. The teacher obviously told them they could not access this area and they basically refused to move. I personally would not have sat on the car just incase it decided to move, but to have a go at the teacher because he did is ridiculous, what that person did was reckless especially with those 2 kids on bikes being so close to being hit as well. What the teacher did was nothing compared to that driver, yet majority on here complaining about the teachers actions rather than concentrating on the driver. So sad.
why his pride would not let him park where he should and not where he wants .\nDriver decides its ok to risk kids and teachers safety by driving like a prat.\nany one who thinks this was/is ok is a complete and utter arse hole .
TEACHER WHOLLY TO BLAME!!
hermateige Rd
Why on earth does science teacher McCarthy sit down on the bonnet of a car? He must know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction! Head of the school Zoe Johnson-Walker seems very keen to completely overlook this - perhaps she has not seen the footage properly......(doubt it). Cynics might say that there is an attempt to manage or conceal any contributory negligence from the school. I do not condone or congratulate the driver. McCarthy seems to have made both himself and his school appear very amateurish.
Nonsense the car gave the old man a ride to school totally innocent
The amount of people defending what the bloke did shows that there are more complete and utter twats using the internet than ever before.  And all you fuckin' morons saying 'I'd have done the same if he sat on my car' are just spouting the usual kind of bollocks that your type always mouth off when your gob is bigger than your balls!
The teacher didn’t sit on the car bonnet cos I saw as I was the kid on the bike (on the right)
Cheap car cheap driver
has to be a woman driving ...benefit mum had no dick last night ...Jeremy kyle fcking ppl
He didn't sit on the bonnet - he was forced on to the bonnet when the driver deliberately ran into him. The driver is a lunatic and should have his licence revoked.
it's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, a half pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.\nHit it!\n\n74' Dodge Monaco with a 440!
We all know the Top Gear car chase was the best ever
Love your videos donut media <3 keep up the good work!
I hate semi's. Especially when the car you drive is small in comparison. People who take on semi's on the free way are stupid.
I love this! with real chases not like today in the fast and Furious thing
NO ONE does a car chase scene quite like good old USA!
Great choices. Now do the 70s: Bullitt, The driver...
Play the game Driver San Francisco. There is 4 or 5 car chase sequences right out of some of the best car chase movies. Its fantastic.
kick ass list. you should use a soundbooth next time tho. the echo of your voice is annoying.
Oh, you started narrating your videos! Good for you!
It came out in May of 1990 so it fell just shy of an 80's movie but I've have always LOVED this car chase from the movie Short Time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWRrSufx5kw
On this episode of watch mojo...
That chase from Cobra is, easily, the most absurd car chase I've ever seen in a theater.  I mean, really.  Here's Stallone, in a wildly modded and totally sweet custom Mercury...with nitrous injection, a stonking motor, the whole shebang.  He can't catch a stock Dodge Aspen.  I mean, those guys are driving what you'd pick up at Alamo as a rental in 1985.  They outrun him.  I remember howling at the screen, as Stallone flails.   He struggles to keep up.  And then he crashes.  They escape.  In their Dodge Aspen. That's the chase.  Some action hero.  Cobra?  Hah.  More like...um...Slow-bra.
I think you should've added Dirty Harry - The Dead Pool.  Awesome car chase with a remote control car that has a bomb in the streets of SF
The Blues Brothers, number 4?!?!?! Come on....
No Man's Land (1987) - Charlie Sheen and DB Sweeney are car thieves, more specifically Porsche thieves. The chase scene with the 911 Turbo and the rival car thieves is epic.
If you like old truck movies I suggest Maximum Overdrive or even better Duel
The Semi Truck thing?\n\nIt's not just a phobia, there are some serious physics involved with that kind of mass! \ncare must be taken driving around them! <3 all
now do top 10 from the 90s and 00s!
2:33 “favouritist ” isn’t a word
KNIGHT RIDER - like every episode with turbo boooooost?!
Good entries on the list. I got some others for you to check out. Take a look at the last Steve McQueen movie The Hunter. There is some good car stunts in there. Even a chase with farm equipment chasing a Trans Am. Also, even though the movies are not as liked as the first. Smokey and the Bandit part 2 and even 3 were 80s flicks with good car scenes.
Nice to see the Junkman getting some love!
That first clip features a Ferrari 308 GTS not 308 GT (no such thing). GTS in Ferrari terms refers to the Targa Top
The 80's must have been fucking epic
Lets see if you bastards can do 90
You also missed Smokey and the Bandit
My boss worked on the opening chase of mad Max 1
Good collections.
Ronin has an awesome car chase, I think that's 90s though?
Donut Media can you make a list of the top 10 American supercars?\nthank you
You should do one for the 1990s 2000s 1970s and 1960s!
The Blues Brothers\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue's Clues
I was hoping to see Blues Brothers. This video did not disappoint.
I know how you feel with the semi truck thing. I'm not afraid of them personally but my girlfriend is TERRIFIED. Even when she's not in the car I still have to floor it past them out of havit
Great video! Mine has always been the chase in Cobra. I remember seeing it when I was about 10 and it was the greatest thing in the world! That Mercury is so bad ass!
I came here basically to see The Blues Brothers on the list.\nI ended up with a couple another movies I should watch :P \nThanks! :D
Duel, it was made in 71 so I see it not making the list.  As far as car chase by sketchy semi, that's the whole movie.
great car scene from the movie Ronin!
Make a video on the S2000
A dumb little fact, but the Santa Fe Diesel engine at 5:28 is actually still in service for the Big Trees and Pacific. And you can still see the Santa Fe livery  if you look hard enough. It also wears the same no. 2600 as it did in the film.
YOU CALLED THE MONACO A JALOPY? BLASPHEMY!!!!!
Smokey and the bandit but thats not 80s
so glad mad max made it on here
Future hall of famer... The opening scene in Baby Driver.
very good countdown. on the other hand, the echo is distracting, you guys should really record the voiceover in a soundproof room.
Why not a Greatest car chase scenes of all time?
I'd be curious to see your list of the best chases from each decade. This formula works well since it's too hard to make a top 10 of all time list without EVERYONE's list being practically the same group of the most famous chases. They end up overlooking the lesser-known gems like some of the films in this video.
*Every battle from Initial-D with eurobeat intensifies*
Mad Max 2 is in my opinion the ultimate car guy movie, and also my favorite movie ever made.
4:35 Does he honestly think they were actually going over 100.
The whole time, I was thinking of Baby Driver...
What about the Chase from the opening scene of The Incredibles... I mean... it probably took place in the 80s...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJk .... it was probably the 90s
I think Beyond Thunderdome should have been included.  Cars, motorcycles, planes, a train, and a fucking hand cart.
Beverly Hills Cop. Hands fucking down... or the Blues Brothers. Anyone else is just a pussy
You guys should do Top 10 car chases from the 70's next and Smokey and the Bandit better be in there lol.
My favorite car chase from 1980's \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TF8z7h1lhQ
Glad to see 007 represented, but the car chase from For Your Eyes Only (with a Citreon 2CV) was also worthy of inclusion.
Are we going to get one for the 70s?
Lol for real tho I stay as far as possible from semi-trucks. I either stay 5 car lengths behind them, get over to the opposite end of them or try to get in ahead of them. Idc if I miss my exit I'm staying away from them because of movies like the ones mentioned. Also Great video.
your mic has an echo or the room your in
Don't have a phobia of semi trucks per say, but I do have reoccurring dreams of getting t-boned by one while going through an intersection.
How many times he said Semi Truck ?
Everything should go back to strickly trains for shipping, get Semi's off the road
Interview: why do you want to be a stunt driver? Fearless Candidate: I got nothing to lose but my laifu...interviewer: you're hire!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evA3_NV7cPM
1970's Gone in 60 Seconds. (1974). Eleanor
The original gone in 60 seconds is the best
Where's Smokey and the bandit 2 with old Buford and his posse of Gaylord and Reggie in the desert... Classic !!
What about the car chase in the james bond movie For your eyes only?
bullitt
the living daylights?
The Blues Bros. got robbed
0:56 that poor Plymouth Duster RIP
The wraith
Awesome list.
Semi trucks are scary
Bullshit how was blues brothers was better then cobra fuckwit bullshit video
i love Semi Trucks !
Movie cops are fucking stupid af
Very nice congrats
im a stunt driver m8
The general lee

fuck semi trunks man i feel you homie
I cringed intensely when that big rig crushed that Duster
I like semi trucks
0:21 shoob
The Wraith, Charly Sheen and the Dodge Turbo Interceptor
awesome list!
1:13. Those are fruits!
rápido y furioso no es nada .. ala par de estas películas
Please Up to speed: Subaru WRX
Hers 3 moves for you : Smoky and the bandit. Gone in 60 sec. Vanishing point. 😊🖒
Gone in 60 seconds!!!
Gone in 60 seconds.........i know its not from 80's but come on
Ken Block would be an awesome stunt driver, don't you think!?
I would have included CONVOY, and Steven Spielbergs DUEL, i mean cone on both of these films are basically a huge semi-truck chase
And where was Duel? That film was just a chase scene >.<
You guys forgot about Smokey and the bandit
wish you would be in canada this week with us man!! Miss you!! Killer footage as usual!
Ben. I love your positive attitude, your amazing eye for photos, your badass editing skills, and the fact that you share bits of your life with us! Nicole is fantastic and Cam seems cool too. Watching your vlogs just feels good!
your videos make me want to quit my job and explore the world
Cinematogography is another level. Killing it, Ben. Ever since the Arctic vlogs, I always celebrate when you upload. 🙌🏼\nThe subtitles on the boat though. 😂😆
sick
Fantastic vlog Ben! Thanks for sharing this trip with us! Keep uploading!!!!! Cheers!!!!
You should try driving with both hands on the wheel. You'll be amazed
Amazing photography, loved the intro, watched it as an outro too!
First minute was a visual vibe dude\nGreetings from Germany :)
Got my prints ♥️ but wanted a tee shirt too!
might be time to update the youtube profile pic haha
probably my favourite vlog so far!! I can't wait for the Visual Vibes the quality of this trip's footage is just INCREDIBLE!
What’s the song at 13:40?
These vlogs are awesome, just a shame they are so spaced out
You are fortunate you did not catch the grass on fire. Sometimes with that high grass gets into the exhaust system and starts a fire.
He always seems to have the best jams during car rides
Really wish Ben would daily vlogs again he was one of the best at it loved his contents and quite upsetting to say he’s gone from daily uploading to hardly ever uploading I’ve been watching him since he was on around 150k subs and he would be well over a million subs already if he still daily vlogged
Lovely intro, good episode. Amazed by your work. PLZ HIRE ME.
You and Nicole are brother and sister goals!!
Love the subtitles. Honestly, if you keep up the snapchat or insta stores up, I think most fans will be content with those as vlogs!
that was so incredible Ben! Now all I want is to go on a roadtrip and explore the nature <3
Ha! I just got that same headlamp. Aren't all those settings confusing? Love the visuals in the beginning Ben.
4:45 Oh... that's a real place, I thought you were Joking! ... haha looks nice!
LIke before watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome Ben! I'm a photographer living in Zimbabwe, check out my instagram! @harry.randell
i must say... i'm having a bit of a crush on cam.... ><\nwish the video was in 4k for the intro bit the visuals are SO BEAUTIFUL!
The wait is so worth it! So glad that you take your time to put these incredible images together. Great job on the colors. The croc in the beginning is a killer. :)
Best way for us to live that trip again.\nHow did you get passed the column of ants? Did you drive through it?
What was that animal at 00:50 ??
In Argentina when in 2009 they introduced the bus ticket machines / dispensers on buses, they would only accept coins so of course, the shortage of coins began. People would queue in banks to change notes / bills into coins to pay for the bus fare. Some banks would reach their quota of how many coins they would give out a day so you'd have to go to stands around the city to get change and in some of those places in order to get 10 one peso coins they would ask for 12 pesos or even more and many had no choice if they couldn't wait in banks for a 10 for 10 exchange.  Then in 2011 they brought in the SUBE card to pay for transport fares; you put money in your SUBE card and then pay your fare using that. \n\nIt's sad when some people take advantage like that because in my eyes it's the same as stealing and the people who suffer the most are those who are struggling in the first place because if you're loaded, you're probably carrying the cash on you so you can avoid being ripped off or you know a guy who knows a guy who can cut you a deal. \n\nWe have a saying Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa, meaning as soon as there's a law or a rule for something, someone is going to come up with a smart way to break it for their own profit. I think in English you say Every law has a loophole.
Thumbs up just because of flume
Dope shots in the intro! You are the best and I really want to visit Africa after I've seen your videos :D
be careful with parasites in african rivers, discovery channel made me paranoid with that. lol
I love Hyppo and you just get awesome shots of them. In my mind I am already thinking how to do a similar road trip than you guys!
Who else liked the video before even watching it?
utube should really promote such channels. Good stuff Ben! Keep em coming
What lens did you use for that intro? It was sick
Amazing visuals like always! Cheers Ben. Crazy to say but your T-shirt that I purchased from you I haven’t worn it once.
I’m from Zim! This vlog makes me miss it so much
Hey Ben, another great video! Was wondering how all these lodges in the middle of nowhere power themselves?
I honestly don't know how you haven't reached 1 million subscribers, quality video as always ⚡️⚡️
You're visiting my home Country ... You need to see Matopos National Park, about 50km outside Bulawayo
such good vibes bro!!! Your the best!
I would have been nervous on an overgrown road like that...  as w found out, it means people don't use that road.  Amazing that it actually did end up going somewhere!  Cool croc and hippo shots!
Looking forward to tomorrow's vlog. aka 3/4weeks. :) Keep up the amazing work Mr. Brown!
Beautiful and wonderful as always :)
Yohhhhhhhhh!!!! Ben this is incredible and I cannot wait for the Kenya film. It's going to be another level. Don't let people pressure you into editing the vlogs in their time. This is a special trip and the fact we can even see/be apart of it is special.
Hahaha the captions when the mic wasn‘t plugged in xD I love your videos Ben, you’re the biggest inspiration for me! Made it to 640 Followers so far 💪😊
This is what YouTube was made for. Not some crappy diss tracks or boring videos. Thx for being you Ben and always producing quality and beautiful content
Can we just get some appreciation for the depth of field in those first shots, sharp shooting B.B \nAwesome work 👌🏽👌🏽
Wow the quality of the footage is amazing!!!
i feel bad those days and seeing that video made me feel peaceful for a bit thx
Great video Ben. Need a defender in my life
Rockin that old school music by KAASI from your old vlogs hehe. Great video as always Ben, cheers.
Thanks for visiting where I come from
Karibu Kenya ☀ cant wait for the visual vibes of the trip
classic KAASI song :) it reminds me of your old vlogs
Ben you're the OG! Love your work and cant wait to watch another visual vibes
When the visual vibes coming out
Nice one bro , cheers for showing our home Zim in a positive way.
Love the vibes on the intro and always love seeing you post a video. Just curious how behind are the vlogs right now? Because I know you aren't in Africa anymore. No biggy love the vids!
Hey Ben! I think there is way more potential for the `Kenia expedition` Pumba logo type of thing! I bet there´s someone out there that can make you a animated intro, which in my opinion would fit the professionality of you videos in general better than just a fade/in fade/out logo. Please consider this if you wanted to use it in your Visual Vibes. Keep killing it :)
Can you please bring back your old outro's I miss not being told to work hard, be nice to people, and try not to get lost or killed.
Sik intro, Ben! Keep em coming 👍🏼
Please watch my videos i have no friends :(
Very very good video man keep going \nI love your channel sooo much 😍😍
Got that Isaiah Rashad blasting. I see you!
Yes ben! the intro looks like a little visual vibes!
Whoop whoop whoop what I've been waiting for a vlog can not wait for the Visual vibes 😀💯🔥👍🏿
Amazing intro. Can watch it over and over again, it’s hypnotizing.
This is amazing content Ben. I appreciate you sharing your vision to the world.
I love my country man! Hopefully things will change soon.
You really need to see the south of botswana in the deep kalahari instead of just going to maun and the north keep up the good vids anyway though ⚡️
Savage Pumba!!!  🔥🔥🔥
My home country!I miss it so much!Thank you for showing us the beauty of Africa!
Great Vlog, beautiful footage. Cya everyone until next month. :):(
loved it!
The Zim cash crisis isn't Mugabe's fault, at least not this time. He's too old to even function which is why his wife is running the country now and she's so much worse! She's the reason Zimbabwe's going through another cash crisis right now just like they did back in 2008.\n\nIn other news, This vlog is siiiiick! Man literally cannot wait for the Visual Vibes to drop!
So good to see you happy
Hope you guys had fun, Steve and Wendy are family friends. I know they really enjoyed having you guys there
Aww u didnt take picks of the kaffers...

Yes, bro!
Really enjoyed this one mah bouyuyyyyy

Luv your stuff!
the focus and depth of field at the start is pure sex fml
The cash situation is not all that bad for the general people.  Illegal activity is conducted in cash.  The more the general population conducts its business electronically the better.

I stay Up to 3am Singapore Time Just To watch GMBN Videos When They Get Released
i cant even do a 2 foot gap
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE DJ THAT WAS PLAYING THAT DAY?!
How many times did he say sweet spot
WOW!! Huge drops, and massive gaps!!   I watched the Hardline the other day, epic track!!!
Cmon blake you could pin those!!!  Make sure gmbn has good insurance for ya though b4 u hit it!  Lol
I think Blake is trying to copy Finn Iles hair..?
its insane they have berms right after the huge jumps!
I do 40ft gap jumps rather often. but these hardline jumps are not only long, they are technical, in the way that they boost the riders up, and the run in's are crazy rough
Would love to see Blake and The Don take on this mega-beast of a course! Problem is, could GMBN afford the insurance?!
I wanna see you ride it.
I want to see Blake riding THIS! :-D
c'mon we all want to see Blake clearing those obstacles...
incredible! \nthanks for the numbers. i know that most of the real life look of things is lost over film so hearing just how big the features are makes it just that much more crazy
I could listen to Blake saying trajectory all day.
It's by far the most gnarliest
Leogang DH course had longer jump in the bottom, until Remi Thirion heavily crashed
Dan Atherton. You are a nutter.
All the talk of sweets makes me hungry
Blake's hair is looking SICK!! You crack me up every video Blake, keep up the rad work. \n\nGAGA WHOOOSH!! 👌
I was wondering whether Blake ever tried the track himself. And if not would he ever see himself actually trying this?
Yeah you really need to get your tradektry right for that road jump.
This video is like the Wasp Factory.
You need courage to ride there.  Thanks for the video.
Can Blake ride this stuff.
I like the way he says here.
Where's the sweet spot 😂
Blake looks a bit like Charlie Hunnam in this video. That course is insane.
Wow, even bigger then I imagined!  Blake needs to hit that
please forgive my ignorance but what exactly is red bull hardline? is it like red bull rampage?
That's insane! I love videos like this
I went 45mph on my road bike, and when I became conscious of just how fast I was going, and really felt the way my bike was controlling, I felt my stomach drop and became hyperaware of everything.  To think that I would hit a 45ft gap after obtaining that kind of speed makes my knees shake just thinking about it.
Yeah! Was looking forward to this video from GMBN!
Gwin did not have an invite eh?
He said big 10 times, and he said huge 5 times
Is Blake gonna send it?
Wow you should do more like This it was very interesting to watch
a few extra feet could be added to the measurements to account for the arch of most of the jumps too
Do a video like this at Rampage!
40 MPH on an MTB. What the heck!? Insane.
Come give our edits a watch any constructive criticism would be really appreciated, want to hear what we can do to make our stuff better!!
Would any of you GMBN guys have the bottle to hit any of those features?
Excellent edit! And thank you for the metric values!
*Rob Warner voice*WHAT 2 GMBN VIDEOS ARE ON TRENDING OH MY GOD
Bike vault photo in the making at 6:19, love it
wow... im humbled ... i dont think i could hit ANY of that!
Nope... Nope and more Nope.  The fact that so few riders even make final due to injury on the course shows how hard it is.   Anyone who gets down in one piece - especially given it was wet this year - is a bloody hero IMO.
And Adam Brayton rips a tear-off off his goggles mid-air into dirty ferns\n\nThat is even more impressive!
and this kids, is when you need math to know how far the landing is, simple pythagoras.... 5:10
Remember back in the day doing 8' drops and thinking we were champs! This is just mad!
Awe where was my shout out for making you a brew at the top?!!!
you need someone at rampage this year
Another great video. Now Blake should shred it!!!!!!!
#askgmbn I want to ride megavalance next year but I'm not sure if i should ride with flat or clipless pedals
Getting a ton of merch for Christmas
Blake, are you going to do a claudio caluori of the track in your next vid? lol
You should have done this in LooseFest, where the jumps are +25 meters long :P
Speed gun and tape measure at redbull rampage
#20 on trending how many more videos can you get on trending
Red Bull Hardline 2018 Blake?
Your R sound is coming along nicely, dude.\nLol, such a chiller, love this guy.
4:45 thank me later
But could/would you ride it blake/scott/Neil ?
This is trending ?
Hey Blake do you think you could survive it? Just curious
would be interesting to see how the WC tracks measure up to this beast...
Where  can I get one of those coats
It's a very funny thing when you watching POV from this and it looks so easy... and then you looking at this pack of numbers... . Confusing :D
Thank you
Make your separate channel navyata
A sink plunger works wonders doncha know.
Wow. Thanks bruh. This helped me in _so_ many ways. I’ve _never_ watched a dark circle video like this one on YouTube before. Really. _Thanks_
hi
Great thing my club have done thank u Klopp
You all probably do not know that Spartak did not play half of the composition because of injuries, it would have been a game of attack from Spartak, but due to the number of injuries I had to play from the defense, so do not think that Spartak is so weak
Klopp is the best! 🙂\nRESPECT TO LOYD AND TO KLOPP\n*GO LIVERPOOL!*\n#RedOrDead
I bet Gini's hug made you smile yes I'm talking to you
Nice humanity video .. Very Kind Man Klopp and Loyd ... Favorite Player Salah ... My private Wish to visit Liverpool City and Liverpool LFC
I love that guy his friendly , you would really enjoy his company I bet
Klopp after listen you never walk alone. Oh my goddddd. ❤
such an emotional video.. thank you very much.. love it so much...
I was smiling and I didn't even know
So Beautiful!!!  Warms my heart to see such kindness!
Respect from Manchester United fan
Well done Mr Klopp and Liverpool. Good luck this season from a Millwall man.
Loyd is probably the real incarnation of the spirit of this club. so devoted, and never giving up!
That Gini bit brought a tear to my eye
You have no heart if you dislike this
Now I hope all the idiots that haven't got Klopps back get behind a genuine manager who cares. He will end our drought but, you can't undo 27 years in 2 years
I love make a wish just because they give 'disabled people' {sorry i dont know another  word} a lovely oppertunity to meet someone or to  go somewhere.
Now I don't get emotional over videos but I have to say I nearly started to cry.Fair play to make a wish and to Lloyd for going through all of that and still standing tall
Wijnaldum might be by favourite player now. What a man.
Brought a tear to my eye. Makes me put life into perspective.
Made me tear. Tq make a wish
KEEP SHAKING THAT INSTRUMENT LOYD 🤗🤗🤗🤗🙂
I love what kindness Klopp, Solanke, and Gini gave to him, this is a great treasure in life. This has really made my day, #YNWA
How could someone watch that and dislike!!! Also new found love for Gini that smile and embrace 👌
Arsenal fan here, just wanna say what an absolute geezer Klopp is! Much respect.
Absolutely amazing love this so much he is an inspiration ❤️❤️
what a great lad c:
Im an arsenal fan but that is great of jurgen to do this!
God I love Gini so much
i smiled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor all the wrong reasons
I love Jurgen klopp, he is just so humble and nice\n\n- Chelsea fan
who disliked this?
Jurgen klopp 💛
Wow! great and very touching video. It made me cry,  this is why I love Liverpool fc so much. Love the vid. Liverpool fc supporter here from the Philippines.
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Makes me happy to see people get a wish no matter how small the wish it's just amazing to see
Enough of the charm offensive, Klopp is a dreadful manager, top 4 perhaps and no cups.  We dream HIGHER.
Klopp is so nice
I am a man in Thailand. I love Liverpool because of this.
Who the fuck disliked this video?
He brought smiles and onions with him.
United fan coming in! Klopp seems like an outstanding person. You are very lucky to have him as your manager.
This is just amazing !!
That was a  overwhelming so nice doing things lika that  makes him happy and smiley  interact with him man makes me happy too 👍😀
Every time i was close to to a tear klopp would make me laugh.great video. Hope the club offered him tickets for a game.
He likes Salah for some reason ..? why didn't he choose Coutinho?
thumbs down to those who didnt smile after watching this......
Lovely young lad and very kind of Liverpool.
Class act from Klopp, this coming from a United fan.
4:00 You`ll never walk alone kid <3 x
9YNWA6
fair play Jurgen lad, fucking boss
Who could dislike such a nice video
Loyd also had a wish that Liverpool could score more than one goal with 80 shots on target
Love the way Klopp talks to him like he's a normal human! Some people feel they need to speak to disabled and mentally slower people like children which must be so patronising! Klopp spoke to this lad in the same time he speaks to everyone which is brilliant!
This kid is probably a better keeper than fucking loris precarious karius
God praise loyd
lmfao Jurgen has such a infectious laugh xD
*Jürgen Klopp* 👏👌👍
This is what football is about respect. Klopp your a true gentleman. Well done to Liverpool F.C. #YNWA
Im a united fan but youtube bought me here ... fab video, great stuff from klopp, a very genuine hug from gini and what a brilliant charity
This has genuinely warmed my heart! Can not believe that there are people out there who have disliked this video!!
Make my wish come through and stop wasting chances to score. Fucking head wreckers to watch
i wish klopp would have a shave and brush his teeth...
*Get that kid a free season ticket in the kop end this is the kind support we need in the stadium not the mumbling cunts*
I'm not crying. You're crying
كلوب 😍❤
Brilliant
Magnificent
fucking cute
Gini <3
When Gini hugged him:)
Wow
Class act from Klopp 👌
Top class that.
Sweet
Beautiful!
Nothing is guaranteed.
I'm so sad for the kid when klop get the sack 🤧
O my god when he sang YNWA that was amazing
Liverpool=Greatness
Klopp,You amazing man
👊❤❤❤👊YNWA👊❤❤❤👊
Good stuff
The best Coach
It Puts things into perspective, Cmon yer Reds!
Klopp seems a lovely bloke
Fantastic video
God bless....
What a good lad Klopp...
Beautiful, good man Klopp!
Never sack Jurgen !!!
Awwwwwww just the best LOYD YNWA 👊🔥💥
Lovely video!
Klopp what a guy
Loyds a red. Ynwa lad.
That wijnaldum hug 😭😭 so genuine ♥️♥️
is this our new centre back?
I'm not a Liverpool fan who is gini that people are commenting about
I'm a United fan but this is really heartwarming. Massive respect to Klopp for making eye contact with Lloyd when answering questions. He showed genuine interest in the questions and in Lloyd. This is what football is all about, lads.
About Time, such a good movie...\nMargot and Domhnall were both in that.\nhe's very underrated...
Domhnall Gleeson is absolutely hilarious, he should be in more comedies!
Domhnall Gleeson is such a ray of sunshine
Honestly, BBC, can I just say that you've struck gold with Ali Plumb. Absolute gold. He is fantastic.
Domnhall Gleeson is such a treasure
Why the fuck is she so fuckin' beautiful?!?
Margot robbie what a babe.....classy and sexy ....
Margot robbie is such a witty and classy woman💗
Aw, and they were in About Time together too
Be right back guy! (:\nI love Black Mirror.
Omg this is the dead husband from Black Mirror

Wonderful interview with great actors and a charming host!
Can we just appreciate those accents!
shes so fucking hot
Love Domhnall so much!
Domhnall is adorable 😍
HES IRISH?!?!
I just clicked because I saw the dead husband from black mirror  that episode was one of my favorites
Two excellent actors. Also Margot Robbie is the most attractive woman on the planet.
I love Domhall Gleeson so much, he's so lovely. And so is Margot.\nGreat casting
I gotta pretend to be a grown up, 😂😂😂
ok thanks for this cause I was nearly dying for the armpit farts xD
she is cute but WTF is she wearing
Domhnall is such an amazing young talent! But Margot...... smh
Awww  I love her laugh
beautiful
Rachel McAdams was in it's about Time people
In love with Margot since she played Domhnall's crush in About Time. OMG
I see Margot Robbie, i click it
Sorry but Domhnall Gleeson is forever a robot to me
So glad to see them back together after About Time.
She is hot a hell!

Wow. Like fine wine.
Margot robbie beaut
La puta que te parió, colorado mufa.
margot robbie my crush
Domhnall is magnificent 💜
No! Go for more armpit farts! Listening to Margot laugh is heavenly!
God, I love Domhnall's Irish accent!
i like that they pitch this interview for a drama by showing their 2 roles in non drama movies.....shouldn't they have gone Robbie in Wolf Of Wallstreet and Gleeson in Ex Machina
This interviewer is too geeky it's a bit much
Irish and Australian and they never are when they act
****Racist cunt****
Margot Robbie looks so sexy tho
She is turning into a Vixen.
Only seen the title heading. Disgusting & disgusted, unsubscribing.
Top finish. Love the dive from the keeper!
Arsene Wenger reportedly interested in signing him
A beastly finish from Payet's big brother
The keeper trying to save it made it even more special for him. Look how emotional he gets It's like he's just won the world cup! I bet the keeper is so pissed for conceding a goal 😂😂😂
Love how the keeper still tried for it
Better than Benzema
What a fucking finish lad!
Arsenal wenger:I almost signed him
Well down you man this is real fan :)
What a finish bottom corner😂
Not all heroes wear capes
How is this on the trending page and there's only 9 comments??
Candidate for puskas award.
We've all thought about it..
I don't think the goal Keeper was ready for it...
The man is living the dream, what a legend
Hulk has let himself go
Nigga really made the most out of this moment
on his way to liverpool
Lol only the keeper tried
Wasn't that an own goal?
My friend:if you go and score I will give you a pie\n\nMe: hold my beer
That's one off the bucket list 😝
Yellow card for the celebration hahaa
Puskas award winner
Keeper is horrible
Quality finish hahaha
Why is this trending
What a goal 😂😂😂
Lol

0:12 did he smell his own sweaty armpits or something what's that face for lol.
Take notes Messi
Why did the keeper try to save it
what a boring sport
A friend of mine was drunk crying about dying alone at a bar in France and a Scottish guy jokingly proposed to her,  two years later he proposed again on a beach in France and now they have two kids together... some serious RomCom vibes!
Girls, it's humanly possible to travel solo and be in a relationship. I've done it several times and I've met other people who have done it as well. You make it seem like it's cheat bait or something, as if you have to stay at home or break up if you want to travel somewhere and your partner is busy with work/study. It's not rocket science.
The actual content of this video was very disappointing. It did not contain travel advice, or even romance advice for how to optimize your chances to meet people while traveling? Or suggested activities or travel groups? Or even conversely, how to travel by yourself (single) and not fall into the trap of feeling lonely.\n\nThe general tone of this video was quite negative, even though it was said in an upbeat/girls on tour tone. \n\nI love Hannah and Christie seems like she's a fun, engaging personality -- but the content and vibe just wasn't what I was expecting this time. Sorry Hannah.
I mean people can go travelling solo whilst in a relationship and not cheat, we're not all mindless animals. I feel like that part of the video kind of normalises cheating which is bullshit because that should NEVER be considered normal or just a thing that happens. Imo if you cheat on someone then you don't really respect them or give a shit about them in the first place, that shouldn't be normal in a relationship lmao. But I loved the first part about associating happy memories with the person you're with, it's so true!
I don't really agree with a lot you said in this video. Firstly I have been in a relationship for a couple of months now with someone I met whilst traveling and it's going fabulous. Also the thing about traveling solo and not being in a relationship is absolut bullshit. If you're not a completely shitty person and you like the person you're in a relationship with cheating is not gonna happen. I feel like this video and what you said in it wasn't as well thought through as your videos usually are.
I met a guy on holiday over 5 years ago. Went long distance for four years and now we live together. It can work!
My mum hooked up with a tour guide back in the 80's... they've been married for 27 years haha
travelling is not bait to cheat. that's unfortunate that was sort of something laughable in the video. you travel, to travel, not sleep with strangers.
I am still in my holiday relationship, we have been together for 4 years now and I am perfectly happy ❤️. Next to that, I have lived in Norway for my studies, away from my partner, for a semester and even then I have never felt like it was hard to maintain my relationship. I don't feel like I should be seen as an exception..
6 years ago me and 2 mates were travelling Europe, we met a Belgian girl at our hostel in Venice. One of my friends made out with her one night but that was all. Best part of a year later they met up in London for a weekend together and that was them basically a couple since then. After 4 years living together they're now engaged and getting married in Venice next year. They owe me a lot as I chose the hostel =P
This was depressing... :/\nNormalizing cheating is super ...blegh
Why so negative? I don't know why you would always have to hook up when you are traveling. If you value your relationship I think it's totally possible to go traveling on your own and make it work. Love your video's though! I just don't fully agree with this one.\n- love from The Netherlands :)
I feel like this video made it seem like cheating is this inevitable thing to happen when you're away from your partner and that's pretty fucked up. You won't automatically cheat on a solo holiday. People should have self control.
I'm going to go traveling without my boyfriend because he won't get time to take off work but he won't hold me back, we do lots of things separately and it works but I never throw my self at strangers
My boyfriend travelled to New Zealand without me. We have been together ever since for about 3 years.
This was surprisingly disappointing, I was expecting the usual helpful advice you give but this was basically just a rant about how you need to manage your expectations if you're travelling solo :/
Hooking up is an inevitable part of travelling ... what?! Maybe if you're an extroverted attractive person, yeah (or just a really charming and smooth talking extroverted person). But it's definitely not a regular part of traveling for any guys I know... myself included. That's not to say I wouldn't like it to be, it's just not that easy of an option to be like oh yeah I'm going to Los Angeles next month, it's just a fact I already know I'm gonna hook up with at least one person there lol like no that's not a thing I've ever heard of from someone who's not an attractive (and at least partially outgoing) woman. Whether you're single or not
My parents met on a plane travelling to Indonesia, did long distance for a year and have been happily married 22 years, it can work out!! My mum said she valued the time they had together.
My only experience of a holiday-like romance is when I fell in love with a boy from the other end of sweden at a scout camp. I think he liked me too but we didn't even hold hands. Then I went home, like 1000 kilometres away.
idk maybe me and my partner are just the exception but i highly doubt it. When you're in a relationship and you've decided that you're going to keep being in a relationship whilst traveling solo you commit to that decision. I was away from my partner for 4 months and neither of us cheated or even doubted the relationship. YES I met loads of cute guys, YES HE met loads of cute girls, we both partied with people of the other sex but c'mon, you respect your partner and your relationship enough to resist any temptations.
you are Beautiful, Hannah, I like you! tell me more....I like your voice, I wanted to know if I decide to travel overseas, can I meet you and we can go to the restaurants in London, are there Malls, Cinemas, scooters, are there very pretty English girls in London? thanks! Remember my name DINESH, just in case I knock on your door! have a lovely wonderful, week ahead, and a super- weekend!!! thanks!
You may lose the chose one if you just fool around all the time
I met my boyfriend while studying abroad. We've been long distance for 3 months, and he's coming to visit me in another three. It's all going well so far!
I agree with the general opinion that this video was quite Go single or you're inevitably gonna cheat!, But it also helped me with making the decision of not doing my semester abroad next year but instead go backpacking with my boyfriend a year later.
I had a holiday romance when I was 14. It was during one summer and two months after that. We met in Greece and they were my first ever serious partner. I'm really a person who immediately goes all in with any starting relationship. Plus puberty hormones plus experiencing so much for the first time plus all the stress of how we would handle the distance. After three months they broke up with me via email, and it left me absolutely heartbroken. However, it was such a beautiful experience. I had my first kiss ever on an empty beach in Greece, that's pretty perfect :). Never regretted anything about it.
100% get that putting your happiness onto the person you're with!  its like you're looking at things through rose tinted glasses and then you get home and it slowly fades. my issue was that i went to visit an online friend in her country and we ended up hooking up and then because we're such good friends we ofc kept talking after! but something just.. felt odd? there was just this air of what are we supposed to do abt that thing we did every time we spoke when really we should have accepted it as a holiday thing and like you say manage your expectations!
Story Time: When i was 21, I went to Madrid to meet a guy i met online (i'm very ashamed to say we met on chatroulette but it was 8 years ago,  cut me some slack) and it was a BIG disappointment (, I drop the guy the day after I arrive. I got some contact from a friend ofa friend who did an erasmus there the year before. So i met a groupe of cool people and we went out and I immediately saw that one guy was my type. He played the guitar like a god and we hooked up for a magical week!! I was a bit sad at the end but mainly grateful to have crossed his path :) Like you said, we both know it was for a short period of time!\nI also dated 2 guys and we were kinda long-distance (Paris vs south of France, between 4 and 6 hours of train) and it didn't work out but i can't really tell if it was the distance or just that they weren't great for me?\n<3
I watched this video while getting ready, and when finished, returned to my room to my sleeping Australian boyfriend who I met while abroad who took a $1500 22hr flight to visit me for the first time since I left. We've been together a few months and are INCREDIBLY happy 😄 normally I love your content Hannah, but I feel like you just invalidated many of your viewers' relationships by insisting that long distance relationships starting with a vacation are laughable, or that a partner will cheat while traveling. Sorry Hannah, but this one wasn't for me.
Couples when travelling also seemed to be the ones more respectful around others, it was the holiday romances that used to be inappropriate in dorm rooms
Hannah you are fabulous but given the content and some of the statements in the video, just look down below at people's reactions / comments —\n\nnext time make sure to think through your messaging and what the video should actually discuss (i.e how to holiday fling, pro tips, not normalising cheating). \n\nLook forward to your next video :')
My uncle met his wife while working at a backpackers that she was visiting and now they’re married with two kids
My mum and dad met on holiday! And they're together 27 years later 😂
I'm happily divorced from my holiday romance :)
I can't even get a fling at home  never mind on holiday
The holiday fling thing is interesting to me as my sister met her v long term boyfriend on a party holiday in Zante and he lives like 6 hours away from us but they make it work really well! They did have about 6 months where they weren't officially dating or planning on dating tho... In regards to travelling solo whilst in a relationship I wouldn't really agree, I think it's about knowing yourself and what you want more than anything... Like for me I am very much an individual who can go ages without seeing my partner and stay v committed as long as I know they're there and we care about one another and had real trust, plus I'm not having sex until I'm married anyway so that temptation is easily avoided for myself at least. I'd say a bigger concern would be the amount I'd change/grow as a person whilst travelling and ensuring that the relationship was on either the same or a stronger path and dynamic when I got back !
Two summers ago, I met an American girl in Milan. I was just enjoying the city and she was there for work as a fashion blogger. We hung out most days for three weeks, went to dinner, museums, even her work events sometimes, and we hooked up a bunch of times. It was lovely and we made plans to stay in touch and possibly try a long distance thing, and she invited me to stay with her when I come to New York. She even went to the airport  with me to say goodbye. I was daydreaming about her the whole flight back. The moment I landed and had a normal internet connection again, I saw that she had blocked me on all social media. Fun.
I went travelling and teaching in Asia solo in a relationship and it was totally fine-- he joined me at the end of my travels. The following year we went backpacking around South America together and it was wonderful and we made good friends along the way too. I think it depends on your own level of commitment.
I traveled abroad for two months whilst in a relationship, and I was never even tempted to cheat. I know my partner wouldn't be either. Honestly, i think the people who cheat are the people who go into it expecting to cheat, or whose relationships are already in trouble, or not very serious. If you go into it with a good foundation and being very committed to each other, you should be able to make it work.
When I was in Egypt I had a proposal of marriage from a guy who worked in the Jewellery shop on the cruise shop lol ive heard about scams so would not have done this but im not attracted to guys anyway lol. Ive also been attracted to people who ive met on holiday but just remain friends with them cus they have usually been straight lol
Did you ever remember the name for the feeling people get when they associate good feelings, which can be confused as love, with someone they travel with? I'm looking to write something about it, and would like to know if you know the name or have a study you can point me toward. Thanks! Lauren
Enjoyed your video. Brought back memories. So much love and sadness at the same time. Reminds me of this song: Wake Up by Coheed & Cambria.
HahahahHAHAA. I met my boyfriend of 1 year and 1 month while away for the week. It does work.
I went travelling for about half a year and was never even tempted into cheating with the man I am currently engaged to now. This is just my experience, but I made many friends and I'm sure there were nothing but opportunities but the thought genuinely never crossed my mind. I wasn't travelling to hook up with someone, I wanted to see the world, I had a very good relationship back at home and I wasn't keen on ruining that for a quick fuck. That's just my opinion and my experience, though! But I'm happy I travelled, it gave me a newfound independence, lots of experience, and I'm also happy I didn't throw away a perfectly good man on a whim. I think sometimes people get too comfortable with the idea that people are expendable, and I don't believe this to be true. I enjoyed the video though and seeing what your guys take on everything was.
I recently went travelling for 4 months and I debated whether to stay with my boyfriend of 3 years because of all the things you mention in this video, which are pessimistic but sometimes true. However I'm soo glad I didn't watch this video before I went, because it would've pushed me into ending the relationship! We managed to stay together (with modern tech it was actually quite easy) and if anything it made us stronger. Now we're doing long distance at uni and I feel like we are very prepared, so if anyone feels pressured into ending a relationship because they are going travelling, I strongly urge you not to if you feel the person is worth it
I don't think this is how everybody travels... Some of us don't even want to meet anyone whilst travelling, let alone hook up with them.
I went to an island 11000 km away from my home for a school exchange when I was 15 and met my boyfriend there who was also 15 at the time. We kept contact for a year then I went back, then a year after that he moved to France and again a year after that I moved from Germany to France and we have been living together for the past 4 years 🤗 I have lived in other places (Birmingham! 😍) on my own in those years for Erasmus and internship but I would not go traveling without him just because I think that I wouldn't enjoy the time fully while missing him and because I would rather have amazing experiences with him... But yeah I know that our case was a bit crazy especially in the beginning but now that it has worked out I like to think that it was meant to be :D (also our goodbyes after only a week together and not even having hooked up were heartbreaking so that was maybe the first sign :D)
Very disappointed by the tone of this video.  You can absolutely be in a relationship and solo travel.. I enjoy/follow both Hannah's and Christie's channels but the overall feel of this video was very immature. :/ Please stop normalizing cheating.
I've never had a holiday fling, but I also don't travel that much.
For anyone interested this is possibly what Hannah was hinting at 5min in;\nMisattribution of arousal is a term in psychology which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel aroused...An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress (Wikipedia).
I disagree that if you're going solo traveling, you have to be single. It might be because I'm non-monogamous. But if both partners agree that that's something that could happen, and are okay with it, then all's well. I always say that traveling changes you so if your partner is going traveling, you have to expect that you'll be meeting a different person when they come back. That's cool!
When I was 16 I went to work in a summer camp for kids for a week, met a guy, sparks flew instantly, we were inseparable, but then the week ended and we had to go home to different cities (different countries technically) and we basically never got to see each other. We kept talking loads and loads over Facebook, and slowly but surely I realised that the more I spoke to him the more the rose-tinted glasses and butterflies in my stomach wore off and I realised I just didn't particularly like/respect him as a person - he ended up saying some absolutely dickish, horrible stuff to me over Facebook (he apologised later but it was too late and I had seen his true colours) and I basically haven't spoken to him since. I still remember that week though where everything was shiny and fun and exciting so fondly though! I guess the moral is, be aware that you won't get to know people too well during short intensive periods of time, so enjoy the butterflies but be cautious about staying committed/invested after you've parted ways! You could realise down the road that they're just not that great!
Hannah Witton: The New Queen of Jump Cuts XD
Way back when, I met a girl while travelling in the north country, we really only snogged, but she gave me her contact info.  We wrote for awhile (this is pre-Net), then I flew for a visit to her city for Xmas - my mistake was expecting things to go a certain way (young and dumb at the time), and it never did, which was frustrating; she had a medical issue I wasn't fully aware of, so it was more flat mates, and nothing else.. Got more awkward as we spent the holiday with her family etc #majorderp  As well, the most awkward goodbye o.0\n\nSo remember kids, don't flirt and fly or something... What Hannah said lol
hi amazing and beautiful Hannah. with love from australia
I also went interrailing with my friends for 3 weeks in a relationship and my boyfriend went on a lads holiday to Cyprus. We are still together and totally great. Trust and respect guys!!! If you truly love someone it's okay to go without them. You should realise how much they mean to you, not how someone else is more interesting ❤
Was on a family vacation in Mexico (just me without my brother or sister) and ended up going out to a club (the pub is more of my scene in general haha) with this guy from a university field trip (a university from the province next to mine in Canada AND his mom was one of the chaperones of the group). We ended up making out on the beach, on the golf cart taxi back to the resort, and then in his hotel room..with a bit of under-the-clothes action...against a wall. It all felt very passionate and movie-esque at the time haha. He looked a lot like Miles Teller, who I have a crush on to this day, but I'm so glad the hookup ended where it did because seeing him the next day on the beach and awkwardly eyeing each other while our parents chatted (they had hit it off at a bar the night we went out and basically pushed me to go hang out with people your own age! which had never happened before). Thankfully, he was leaving the day after...because as much as I would have liked to keep that fling going while on vacation, there is NO WAY I could flirt with a guy in front of my parents.
Met my bf in a hostel in France, traveled Europe together for almost 2 months after that. We worked out that we had been in the same city on the same day, 1 month prior, just 3 minutes apart as we had the same photo with the time stamp on our phones. I went to his country for 3 months and stayed with him as a proper couple, and it worked. I'm moving to his county soon (after all most a year long distance because he wasn't employed and didn't have his own place), and I'm super excited, been learning his language since just before we met. Been together for over a year now.
I am currently travelling in Thailand with my friend and I'm in a happy and healthy relationship. However my boyfriend is at university so we are used to long distance anyway. Depends on circumstances in each relationship xxx
It's a fun video, but you talk like everyone is the same and being committed is the exception.
THE FRINGE WAS A GOOD IDEA. LOVE IT!
Ahhhhhh I met the PERFECT guy totally by accident while I was in Paris and we agreed to just live in the moment and make memories for the remaining week or so that I was there...and we were really good together 😭 but now we are still in touch talking everyday despite the fact that I'm on another continent, and he's gonna come visit in winter!!! Just gonna see where it goes...
Man, I have to move to England... >.>
Hi Hannah! I've actually just got back from Menorca myself and had the ideal summer romance. BUT she lives in Scotland and I'm from the U.S. and we're in the midst of figuring out what we are (though as you said, shitstorm IS an accurate word). Do you think we should be having this conversation or should we both accept that such a long distance would complicate things way too much???
not quite the same as travelling but I've lived through two university freshers fortnights, met a whole host of new people and never felt the need to cheat on my long distance boyfriend. just because you're in a new place experiencing new things with new people doesn't mean you have to hook up with randomers to have fun. really didn't like the message on this video
My friends met at summer camp and have been dating for a year now. They live across the world from each other.
Aw I've watched the both of you for ages and so glad you're making a video together!! :)
I am totally 'That girl' who hooks up with the tour guide and gets her heart broken - however I have been with my 'tour guide' boyfriend for almost 2 years now and am super happy so just sometimes there is a happy ending! ha ha
Do people not understand what a fling is? Especially in this context.
Hannah your bangs are looking so good!!!!
I would just like to say, I think this video reflects a much healthier _mental_ attitude toward sex and sexuality.  Carrying contraception does _not_ mean being on the _prowl_ for sexual _opportunity._  It means recognizing one's nature as a sexual _being_ among sexual _beings,_ with sexual _instincts._
I got with my boyfriend literally the day before going on an Erasmus year on the other side of the globe. It worked super well for 2 reasons:\n1. we knew the date of my return flight at the end of that year (+ i was coming home for xmas)\n2. it was the very beginning of our relationship and we were super in love, super cheesy, we got to know each other very well, we would skype and all, and it was all fluff and love, it was amazing. i was so into him that i had only eyes for him anyway ^^\n\nthe 2nd year we were visiting each other every other weekend, worked super well, super in love.\nbut the 3rd year, he went on an Erasmus year, and it got super tough. \n1. we still knew his return date, and we saw each other every other month\n2. but we got super tired of this long distance relationship thing. Also i craved flirting and physical touch, not a good mix, it was really frustrating and sad. \nEventually we agreed to try an open relationship so i could get the physical tenderness i was longing for. Now we're settled together and everything works super well, i'm super glad we had that long-distance thing, but now i'm done with it ^^
I went on a semester abroad and met a boy who I fell completely head over heels for after ending a relationship back home just before I left. I went into the new fling telling myself it wasn't serious, and it ended when we came home. But we stayed in touch and now we're in a happy (albeit long-distance) relationship seeing each other when we can, and I can easily say I've never been happier.
okay, this video might be of use to me in the future, but at the moment i got nothing out of it, which miight be because im a virgin and have a crippling fear of opening up to one significant other both in the litteral ang figurative sense, so i think i need more of the how to be brave and confident and stop giving a crap about making an ass of yourself and how to not run away screaming in the opposite direction when feeling feelings...
Any advice for traveling with a partner?
I went backpacking for 9 months, my bf and i stayed together but agreed on an open relationship physically, talking probs once a week or so and in contact via messaging. Certainly when i got back it was a readjustment but it all worked out and having that freedom was exactly what i needed
I'm 14........I have no interest in a holiday romance but I love these two so much
Hannah! The audio in this is great! When I started the video it seemed so crisp and clear that you could have been in the room x
Then there's a people who would like to hook up when they've been traveling but haven't met anyone....  :/
Hannah you are really a amazing YouTuber
Omg that attachment theory blew my mind. And explains a lot of feelings I've had about past flings!
boyfriends of two years is on a gap year and saving up to go travelling with a few mates next year for a couple months. love you hannah but this didn't make me feel the best about life😂😂😭
Love you both!! :) Fun video. -Ash
not quite a holiday, but i went on a study abroad to london (i'm american) and my roommate there (also american) met a guy on tinder whom she started seriously dating almost immediately - she ended up getting a job in switzerland for the following summer and they met up somewhere in europe every single weekend - now she's back in the states and they're still dating long distance - literally the dream
This reminds me of Call Me By Your Name which is an amazing book and the film comes out next month and it really explores the lasting effects of holiday romance
That moment when your girlfriend literally lives in Germany. I haven't seen her for three years. If I travel I'm probably traveling TO her 😂😂😂😂
I've traveled alone while in a relationship and while single. I never hooked up (even though I had nothing against it while single). It's fascinating to me to hear about people who do hook up. :)
this could not have come at a more appropriate time .... me and my attached heart are feelin VERY attacked hahahahaha
My exception story in a nutshell: I searched Rome for him just to have a DTR and 2 years later we're engaged!
I just don't see the point of a holiday fling. Why enter into it in the first place if there's no possibility of a relationship after the holiday? Sounds like an utter waste of a holiday to me!
loving the hair :D you look tanned though, did you got anywhere ?
My aunt married her holiday romance. So they can work, it's just not very likely and a rare occurrence.

Oh hi, guest services.
love hannah yellow cushion.
bad vid imo,sorry hannah i usually love ya vids!
yeeee I love the bangs
Golly. People's life experiences are just... just so different, you know? May I say with some sarcasm, I dunno what it is about being an introverted, overweight (trying to be less so!) white dude with horn-rimmed glasses and a scruffy beard, but hookups are not things that happen to me, whatsoever. I've had actual long-term relationships, and I'm not a dysfunctional loser -- I know how to be funny and chatty and charming -- but the thought of having sex with me does not seem to occur to the ladies 'round me. Nor the lads, nor the sheep neither, truth be told. Count yourselves lucky, folks...!
Look at those amazing dimples!
Haha I fucking loved this video
It hurts that you scratched both watches :(
Hey jerry i am a big fan of your channel plzzz plzzz make a durability test on nokia 8
This fucking watch costs more than the iPhone X!!!!!!!!
Apple is always looking for ways to stole your money and this is another example. Thanks for this test.
Classic Apple
Nice video, but could you STOP SCRATCHING WATCHES!!!
Apple has turned into yet another purveyor of overpriced, over hyped junk err I mean products. The cult of Mac is a powerful drug. The first computer I used was an Apple II in grade school in the late 70's, this is NOT the same company in any way, shape or form, sad.
ill go for an android smartwatch or one that is compatible with my samsung
If it is scratching at 7, it's the same as glass. Then, it's a useless sapphire, better don't mention that.
he was pressing harder on apple watch
Jerry, I enjoy you making apple fans look more and more like fools each video you make 😀. 1300 bucks for an over price hipster gadget! When you can get the samething for 300! When will people learn?
How it is possible for you to unbox it and scratch it in the next minute?
But the Apple Watch is touchscreen... I'm no expert but surely that makes a huge difference in the materials required?
That tissot looks so much like my wenger..
I think that Apple now understands that almost all of their fan base consists of retards...That's why they are now giving *low* quality products for such a high price..!!!!! Apple sucks and it doesn't matter what you say, Apple sucks big time..
WHY ARE PEOPLE SO UNGRATEFUL THESE DAYS I DONT EVEN HAVE 200$!!!!
Even if I had an extra $1300 to spend on a watch, I could never justify purchasing something like this.
That's how much apple charges for a fucking watch???  I'm so happy I switched to android. Fuck, apple is such a massive ripoff.
For 1300 dollars it would seem Apple could have made a true genuine sapphire watch with no impunity even a genuine diamond coating with pure sapphire underneath just saying and I love apple but come on guys
What I know is that apple sells shit to customers at a premium $1300 price tag. That watch shouldn't cost that much. It's what Trump does with his name. He knows his name is worth more than what he sells. Apple has become the same thing.
The rubber seems to be legit tho! XD
For 1300 dollars I’d better get a diamond screen
Meanwhile, my 130 euro Rodania of 10 years with sapphire glass still has zero scratches. Been wearing this for every day, also during rough work. Didn't mather.
wow, am i the only one cringing at those scratching sounds? youch
Apple is stealing money... Earning more than they deserve...!!
And what about the back glass with sensors ?
You look like johnny sin.. my phone has scratches..fuck me right
Man I have to say, saw this on /r/videos and I'm not really your target demographic, I rarely remember to leave likes on videos even if I love them, but watching you scratch that Tissot and knowing your pain reminded me to like and subscribe.
The sapphire on the Tissot might get no damage. But the case sure as hell does because you can't keep the damn tool from contacting it. Talk about being spastic.
What's a common level 6 that my watch will come into day-to-day?\n\nCar keys?\nConcrete Wall I might brush against?
if you paid 1300 for this yer a fuckin clown.
I really like that watch, where do I find it? I really love that orange.
Please make nokia durability test and drop test
I can probly afford the tissot but not the $1500 Apple watch
But will it blend?
Get an TISSOT and Paste The apple logo... ;) LOL
This is why I watch your channel....TRUST. I trust all of your testings and greatly appreciate you educating all of us to save our hard earned money. Thank you my friend.
It’s very satisfying to see that abomination getting scratched.
hey, i have that Tissot!
I don't like that RED dot.
The issue with using pure sapphire on the Apple Watch screen is getting the corners of the screen to curve back like that. It can be done, but it’s a lot harder to do it with pure sapphire
GODDAMIT YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT THING TO ME
I havent watched all of the video yet.\n\n\nPlease don't scratch the Tissot watch :(\n\nEdit: NOOOOOOOO
Its an apple product, im not surprised a swiss made watch beat it hands down.
omg apple\nyou really are a genius
just goes to show you how shitty Apple products actually are. they're made to look nice, not actually be nice, they're literally made to break down after a year
fuck apple lmao u dont even get what the tell u..
Personally i dont really care for apple products and i think apple as a company can be a bit scummy with their products and prices but im not gonna get all pissy about it because hey its your money so i wont tell you how to spend it
Apple is capitalis they want u money
Steve Jobs is turning in his grave
I feel sorry to the tissot :(
I love how chill his voice
Apple did not come up with the first telephone watch .\nThe Chinese made the first telephone watch. \nThis video just show you how Apple is overcharging consumers for a inferior products.
All the Android users watch this video to shit on Apple when they are poor losers who don’t understand the company and why certain versions cost so much.
how about a drop test to see if these sapphire are shatter resistant?
What Tissot watch was used on the video?
This hurts to watch
First, that's no innovation at all. Way behind on the watch as they are on the phone. Very expensive usual products, sold as premium, which I think is only in the heads of the less educated. There is NO premium, as this type of classification is truly different for each individual.\nAs we aknowledge beauty and good taste differently, the same way we take premium under consideration. So just taking those Apple products as premium, just because they say so, it's only a sign a premature brain leaking :) .
Think I could get that scratched Apple Watch? Very good video!!! Thank you.
Nice to see the scratch test on the ceramic! How does the black chrome fare?
*The* *bed* *is* *lava* *like* *this* *if* *you* *died*
Fucking piece of shit apple. All apple is a rip off and all people that buy apple are morons.
I almost saw deja vu when Kyocera beat Apple by miles with the Kyocera Brigadier, while all the rumors of sapphire on the IPhone 6 happened to be false. This is almost similar, only with the [Verizon Wireless] Kyocera Duraforce Pro being the latest one. Speaking of which that sapphire equipped phone will ace that sapphire test as well!!
hurts to see the Tissot getting scratched :(\n\nno one cares about the apple watch
Even OnePlus managed o put pure sapphire on their budget smartphone last year (on the OnePlus 3T) and Apple is cheap enough to not put it on their extremely expensive watch. Congrats, Apple!
Appe is saying a lot of lies like this apple watch real sapphire glass
Apple are scum. How can they get away with this shit?
Literally the bare minimum amount of Sapphire needed for Apple to be able to say it’s Sapphire
please make. a video for mi a1
Clearly Apple continues to sell overpriced and overhyped bs. Oh and BTW, that Tissot watch is absolutely amazing. Thanks for your great videos!
It was hurtful to watch someone scratching that beaut Tissot watch
Does anyone know what model is that Tissot watch? I wanna buy it
The Swiss government wants you for crimes against wristwatches
The dislikes are from butthurt Apple fan boys.
Tim Cook and the rest of the Apple team is really mad at Jerry right now 😂😂😂
They should have just called it flame fusion crystal  just like Invicta does to make bull shit sound fancy LOL! Dude.. congratulations, you literally stopped me from making an impulsive 700 dollar purchase today on a fucking piece of bullshit when it's not even complete sapphire. Thank god for people like you. I'd like to hire you to work for me lol!
i hate you, the fact you have the money to buy an $1300 watch and all that equipment to scratch it. Fuck. You.
Swiss watches are dope! 🇨🇭
1300$ Wtf
Brave man .
Fuck apple
Apple out here finesseing
poor quality Sapphire?
SCRATCHING THE 130,789$ Apple Air
.................. why????????
Zak please moisturise

iScam
Watch the whole fucking video android dickheads
An ugly expensive watch
Box = 1000$ Watch=300 XD
I love this
Hello from Japan 🇯🇵
cheap tricks by apple
Ok, excuse my rant but you know what really grinds my gears? Why the fuck would ANYONE buy a $1300 watch? And not only that, but pay $84 To unlock fast charge ???? Stupid as fuck.
Or, save an additional 300 bucks and don't buy an apple watch at all 😊 it's just an extension of your phone anyway 😊
don’t you think your only scratching the oleophobic coating that protects the glass?

You look like Juni from spy kids 3d
On a good day, Popcorn chicken from Popeyes is like no other. Their BBQ sauce to to with it it stands alone.
So, Young Sheldon looks different to how I imagined
I travelled 25 miles to the nearest Popeyes after seeing this review.
You are like Sheldon from the Big Bang theory but actually funny.
That peak lapel suit is ace my friend.
Holly crap Reviewbrah is awake in the afternoon.
let me take you suit shopping and find a suit that dosent make your head shrunken ...lol your great though really enjoy your reviews
*Reminds me of a young Christopher Hitchens, no?*
anytime he throws shade at KFC i like to think all the higher ups are watching this in an office somewhere and realize that the end is soon for them
I thought Popeye liked spinach.  You don't get any with the meal?
I really wish some of your merch said Goin' In
How is this guy still skinny????
Yo I like this guy
M E A T C R A F T
If you don't upload I don't sleep or shower.
Hey ReviewBrah, I'm not sure if you will see my comment or not but do you think you would ever consider doing a live show? I know that's a strange question considering you do food reviews but I would totally pay to see that! well I hope you are well and thanks for another awesome video
Glad to be able to take a moment to sit down and watch review brah videos ! Thanks for uploading !
3:18 You know you're having some bomb chicken when you can hear that crunch from a distance lol
I can watch his videos all day. I absolutely love him; he's so freaking adorable!!
Reviewbrah when I get paid next wed I'll patreon you some money this channel is a gift to humanity
You should start doing workout videos and record your progress and maybe review different pre and post workout meals for optimal gainz. Thatd be a cool twist
This man is the hero we need.
I'm not a huge fan of fast food, or big companies...but gosh, I love Reviewbrah.
Please review the McDonalds chicken tenders
he looks like Franky from skins if Franky was a guy.
I’m a Popeyes general manager at buffalo new York I feel weird watching this 😂
One shot, no mistakes. Reviewbrah is the realest youtuber. Professionalism at its best 👌
Naked egg taco please!!!! Naked egg taco from taco bell! You're the beez kneez!!!
your videos always make my day 😊💞
You need to come to Texas and review Whataburger!!!
I don't live in America, so I don't have a Popeyes anywhere near me. Hell, I don't even like watching review channels. I can't stop watching this guys' vids though, they're so damn interesting. Anyone else?
Bought some merch. Would have bought a phone case but I didn't see any fro Samsung phones.
T h i s\ni s\nr u n n i n g\no n\ne m p t y\nf o o d\nr e v i e w
How the hell did this guy get 445k subscribers unbelievable!
ReviewBrah, are you okay? You look sort of tired.
Well damn I guess I'm spending $4 on lunch tomorrow
his hands remind me of Sid
Found this Gem of a Channel because of a Meme about St Patrick's Day Donuts on Facebook. Truly how reviews should be done.
will u ever return to end of the internet
Can I be your girlfriend?
I really want to see an hour long video in which you just talk about random stuff. Like a rambling video, because I just watched your 20 minute video about cups of water and I enjoyed the whole damn thing.
ReviewBrah is literally the sweetest and most humble person I've ever watched on YouTube! This wonderful young man doesn't deserve all the shit YouTube has given him and it breaks my heart that no matter how much he knows this affects him, he still wakes up, puts on those fly as hell suits & makes the most enjoyable videos for us to watch. My birthday in next month and I'm going to treat myself to this wonderful man's merch! Thank you ReviewBrah for making me and the rest of your followers so happy💙
You da man.  Fuck Joey's World Tour.  You're bringing class to the game.
Only 10 minutes?! Church is suppose to be an hour long!
Greetings, TheReportOfTheWeek! I have a serious business inquiry, and it would be a blessing if you could respond when your very busy schedule allows it. I have typed out my proposition below.\n\nWhat type of porn do you please yourself to?
Review brah you should do a review on the Hostess limited edition snowball ice cream that just came out :)
Hey there ReviewBrah, glad to know your back in business. I was just wondering if the IPhone case on your website fits the IPhone 6? Thanks
Can we get a video of your tie collection please?
I watched this un-ironically and now I'm hungry
I bought 300$ headphones just so I could hear that crunch
Can you review the crispy buttermilk tenders at mcdonalds
You should throw a pool party upload when you get to 500k subs
when did god decide to live amongst us.
That suit of yours looks i bit over sized on the arms and shoulders, in my opinion
love you man. thanks for always being you. your reviews have gotten me through some rough days.
i thought i was lesbian but after watching reviewbrah for such a long time, i'm not sure anymore
I'll let you know what it tastes like......and...I am guessing Iguanadon? Popcorn Crocodile.
Wish I was also eating chicken  bites whilst watching this I'm so hungry
The silence is magical
I actually love this guy, I hope he becomes so famous
How is his face still so flawless when he eats fast food almost every week?
are there higher expectations of fast food in america? also it would be cool to see guest reviewers/passengers, cheers as always
I enjoy the constant chit chatter of your videos, I really do. But I must admit I find it quite awkward when it goes silent during the time you eat. Could you possibly think of something to do to cover this silence. An example of what you could do; shorten the time it takes for you to eat a certain Food item. Once again I love your videos.
I have no friends or life just give me likes for motivation
You should review KFC's Georgia Gold and Nashville Hot Chicken Little sandwiches.  It's the best way to enjoy both the Hot and Gold.
YouTube is garbage to me for taking your add revenue... Your reviews are the best ... Daymon Drops gets adds on his channel.. Why are you being singled out...? You da man, keep keeping on.. Much Peace
Im waiting for someone to run up, slap the window and scream REVIEWBRAH at the top of their lungs
Any chance you could start recording in 4K?
TheReportOftheWeek has been reported.

He always looks F sharp!
Thank you
Just gotta say LIT merch man
I was at a heavy metal concert last night in NYC, and the guy standing in front of me was watching this video. Glad to know I'm not the only metalhead who loves you.
Don't know what's worse.. the girl using the Gameboy the wrong way or the guy who doesn't know how to properly record a video.
Funny but the girl is smart...and has a sense of humor..even though it shows she has character more...funny what technology can do
I don't know what's worse what's worse the kid playing gameboy wrong or the dad recording wrong \n\nNobody likes black bars at the side
This potato is obsolete\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that I mean the little girl
Listen up parents, please stop letting your children live on ipads. It makes me sick just seeing kids on ipads 24/7.
Wow that kid is so stupid. Im 12 and know how to use a gameboy. I feel sorry for the next generation
How my younger cousins feel when I show them a video tape
Guaranteed to make you feel old tbh
I still have my old gameboy
kids today will not sit down or will not stop throwing fits unless there is a screen in front of them which I am not going to say it is making this generation stupid but it is surely not helping them get smarter.
She already knows so much about phones at such a young age, this is one of my pet peeves
This is just sad, I grew up with the game boy
The Next Generation is set up for failure 💀
If only she was born in the age of buttons not touch
I wish she knew what buttons were😂😥
Soon we will have mind-controlled games and people will be finding the headset to the iPhone X
I've replayed this more than 15 times, I still can't figure out what he is saying.
this looks like the kid who tryed to steal prince harrys popcron😂
This Generation is doomed
holy shit that is really sad
Cute...I guess.  But it's sad how glued to tech she is....Kids need to be exploring, not sitting around with games at that age :/
This is so sad.
I think it's kinda adorable.\nTo everybody talking shit about kids these days ... if, back in 1961, you gave this 8-bit handheld game console to pretty much anybody they would try to open the garage door with it.\n\nTo the guy who said kids today are worthless ... your old man just had the most hardcore de-ja-vu trip ever... dickhead!
Aww man that's so sad
When I got my first ds I had a game which only used the touch screen and I was like WHA-Why aren't the buttons working!?
This is the stuff I press on from trending
This makes me mad for some reason. I don't know why 🤷🏼‍♀️
all these people thinking its bad that she is trying to touch a gameboy are actual retardates, its called fucking evolution m8, die or get used to it
Sign of the times
The kid thinks it is a iPhone, lol
Surprised she even hold it
what is sad about it ?
Yup. This new generation is corrupted.
Modern people: I just a new phone \n\nOld people: this is a Phone?, where all the buttons?
Its sad how shes so young and is already glued to devices. She obviously has a lot of experience with touch screens. She completely ignores her dad and walks away. Shame how common autism is now days. I wasnt allowed to have a computer until i was 12 and only allowed to watch tv for an hour a day
This is why I won't buy my kid any touch screen devices before the age of 13
This is so sad. God damn millennials.
Ok i want back to 1990 Pls where is my Time Machine😐
we are no longer young
I am so fucking disappointed that kids now day don't know what buttons are
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
This generation is depressing
if i had kids, they wouldnt be that stupid to know that you need to use buttons to make it work
game boy and pokemon yellow was my child hood
Try to drive a two decade old car before you was born.
some people will feel very old seeing that 😂
I blame Apple.
Ever heard about buttons?
This makes me depressed.
Sad.
wow...cute.
Haha same with my nephew
lol, kids these days
She’s like ‘shut yo face dad!’
I completely understand that touchscreens are what she knows and what she's used to. But...the buttons are right there. How does she not see the buttons....
This is depressing
sad
Oh no a kid who hasn't been taught how to use a gameboy can't play one the human race is doomed!!!! Why oh why has she been deprived of this life saving skill that is so important to her future? What will become of her if she only knows how to utilise the skills she is taught ? I can't even watch this that poor child !!
Who gives a fuck is she doesnt know how to use it.by the time they are 30 they will be more advanced then us.
In another 20 years kids will struggle to play on a iPhone 8..,
What triggers me the most in this vid is not the kid. But the guy filming it horizontally...
Sad reacts only
*Did she not even SEE the buttons?* seriously.
Ahh a baby!!! (Basically)
Fml
BUT WHY!
lol
hahahaha soooo funnny
https://youtu.be/6qpil4sfcsI
I dunno it seems kinda fake
Ah yeah gameboy is back

This makes me sad
Sadddd🤣
Omfg I love game boys
Damn
Foolish summer child
Lol
Kms

Our next generation... Fantastic
I'm depressed.

Poor poor soul
Ouch.
Pokemon Yellow.....
HUMANITY IS DOOOMED...DOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMED
Fucking disgusting.
I was kinda cringing 😩😬
Sad...So Sad...
this is honestly so distressing
This is bullshit this shouldn’t go viral
oh no...no no no. this is end of humanity
This is actually depressing.
Gee thanks Steve jobs
SOOOOOO SAD
Am I the only one here ago doesn't understand what that thing is? -.- awkward

Vertical Recording? Oh god! why? :(

I always keep wondering if Jeremy's Mustache is real
the sketch was funny, but it kinda dragged on for too long
*Mr. Eckelstone, please report to the lobby to take care of a man licking the fish tank.*
imagine if this was real the lady at the desk\nLady at desk: guess it's just gonna be one of those days..
Lol I went to where they filmed this yesterday
That’s the doctors office I go to
this and the peeta sketch are my favorite sketches ever
This video is so funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thEY JUST YANKED HIS HAIR BACK OMG IM DEAD
I have ofishally become a fish. Sea what I did there. Ok I shell stop talking about myshellf. I might be getting a little bit shellfish. Fin I'll stop.
This is literally my favorite thing rn
I might even unsubscribe because of this.
Great writing Jeremy! Hahaha
Here you go ;) 2:07
Jeremy! Your hair!
You’ll float too
Centimeters cubed
2:08 I LITERALLY DIED 🤣🤣🤣
Hah
Is Whitney preggo again?!
Who wants Magazines!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThis is for my school fundraiser for more extracuricular activities, and every subscription counts! \nJust follow the link below!\nhttps://www.apmags.com/store/landing/3/faf8cecf-2647-498d-b410-5d2badcca8b5
Oh my god....I've been to 30 art museums. This is by far the most beautiful work of art I have seen all my life!
Omgoodness that was so Funny XDDD. I recommended this to my Spanish teacher and he showed it to us during class XDD.
Brb, gotta go study fish in case.
This has got to be one of if not the best of Jeremy's performances to date
So funny 😂
cc’s are cubic centimeters
I LOOOOOOOOOVE U STUDIO C
Aaaaaand now you are Jeremy Limpet.
Wow this is fishy :/
Holy crap Zalmuron was reincarnated as a fish
Didn't find this funny at all.
So sad :(
XD at 0:43 XD XD so funny
is witney pregnant
you havent caught picachu
Weird.
O SAW NEMO AND HIS DAD AND DORY
For the record, I HAVE caught all the pokemon. After 7 generations of pokemon stored away you feel like you can conquer the world
2:07\nI wonder how much he got paid...
Hahaha this has to be one of my new favorites. Jeremy's acting is on-point.
why do you flee? XD
I love how all the people in the office just walk by like nothing's happening.
Your an insane fish bro who’s mouth is enlarged and bleeding
Wow; can't believe they thought this was funny.  Studio C used to be so good.  This was painful.
Everyone knows the dangers of the great white,\n\nBut they neglect the treachery of the great ME!!
Every fin shall bow! :-D\n\n\n\n\nAnd every gill confess?
Love you mallory ,James,sephen,whintey, Jermy,Jason, Adam, Natalie, matt,stacy all studio c
2:12 *MAGIKARP EVOLVED TO LEVEL 2!*
I love how he says 'just keep swimming' when a Dory type of fish swims on camera
I like the framed picture on the wall in the background.
When I got my wisdom teeth out, I though I was a robot.
Oh my gosh, I absolutely adore this sketch! I've been having a really stressful day, and this video was the perfect study break. Studio C, thank you for gracing the world with your art. You never fail to put a smile on my face. ❤
Worst Studio C sketch ever. Thought if I stayed to the end it might redeem itself. But nope. Not that the acting was bad. It was the concept that fell flat for me.
Am I a notification viewer?
How can he be a beta fish if its a salt water tank?
Let me guess. The kyle fish is coming
omg good job +Jeremy Warner! this was literally so funny!!!!! i love the background music in the beginning! congrats you guys this was so hysterical
How do you do all these props? 😂😂😂you guys are amazing😂😂😂
Worst most boring Studio C video ever.
Who actually thought Cc Was close captions?
Why did he get so eloquent half way through XD
Jeremy did such a good job in this sketch though
This is really silly. 'Not well done.
Studio C has jumped the SHARK...\nI'm sorry, I just had to. But in all honesty, this isn't creative humor, just the dumb kind.
You can see Jeremy's reflection in the glass.
This should also be done with squirrels.
Why didn't he just look around and realised he was making things up?
*Public Service Announcement*\n1. Search - ROFL with Ray\n2. Prepare to Laugh\n3. Laugh\nWhy? Because a day without laughter is a day wasted...\nThat is all.
Thanks for the closed captions Studio C!
NEED TO CATCH THE POKEMONS!!
This is one of Jeremy's best sketches.
I love how when he says I guess, just keep swimming? a dory swims into the frame
He is Zalmuron, the REINCARNATED!!
wut
just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, swimmin, swimmin!
ZALMURON THE REINCARNATED
Nice
Hey , its Nemo and Dory
Rip headphone users
Lol and here I thought Jeremy was a bad actor xD great Job dude
He sounds like a retard XD
This was hilarious! 😂😂😂😂\nI want to know who the 561 who didn't like this were.
Is this the forgotten sequel to that Kevin Smith movie with the I'm a Mac guy?
Lovely requiem at the beginning
They missed one of mine. Came in and screwed up a molar. Assholes.
I KNOW THAT EXACT OFFICE I USED TO GO THERE ALL THE TIME
Please make another parody version of a band (like Led Zepplin, Queen, Eagles, or the Animals, any one of their songs, please make a funny version of it.
Is Whitney pregnant?
JEREMY NEEDS TO BE THE STAR OF MORE SKETCHES
CC is cubic centimeter just so you know,,, it's a measure of volume,,,,
TRENDING YES WE DID IT REDDIT!!!\n\n\n\n\nNo one? ... ok I will show myself out

Do not encourage comments from Man on Fire . He is a sick and dangerous racist who needs to be reported.
Woman belong in the kitchen.

Its not the 20th century, its the 21st XD Fox looking stupid while making other people look stupid, double stupidd
Listen well, Saudi Arabian women\n\nYou will not drive the car, and if you drive a car, you will drive and you are scared,\n\nSay don, O men!
Now million of Indian will lose there job as a driver
When will Saudi Arabia grant freedom of speech to other religions?
the beginning of the end for saudi arabia
Fuck no😭😭😭😥😥😥😥 I dont want no fucking woman to drive in saudi arabia im 14 years old and i drive my family in riyadh saudi arabia im saudi,and it only makes it worse if woman drive 😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥😥
Thank you you're highness, KING SALMAN OF SAUDI ARABIA 🇸🇦💚💚💚💚
What is this so interesting for.
Welcome Saudi Arabia to the 21st century. Now it’s time for USA to progress and invade other people’s countries.
These women have Barbarian Arab genetics in them, very few are kind or empathetic. Without caning and stoning to death the young ones women will be sleeping around , galloping in their black veils. I do not beliieve in FGM, but female genital mutilation is done for a reason --- that they dont ride around with their ready to burst clitori's. \nMr Trump please stop immigration of Arabs to the USA. Other than beautiful women who may or not assimilate, they have nothing to offer to your country. Most of their women are air heads.
A dream come true we've been fighting since forever
you may not know that we actually drive long from long time 😁 but not in the capital cities which is not really problem there you can get Taxi or Uber simply .
So from next year women in Saudi will be allowed to drive but only if they get a permission letter from their male guardian, for certain times of the day WITHIN their district. *clap clap
I'm a Saudi Arabian girl and it's not your fucking business America we do whatever we want whenever we want  so\nshut up!
Too much privilege for certain women spoils them mentally....based on observation. The more money you give makes them arrogant. I'm not even a Muslim...
Watch every Saudi woman pack her kids up and drive out of that shit hole country.  Thats why they cant travel without a male guardians permission is because Muslim men know these women would be gone. I hope all the Saudi  women run till they stop in a western country. Congratulations,  welcome to 2017!!!!!
Somehow, I don't trust this. It seems unlikely a strict religious based area like Saudi Arabia  would do this. I'm glad they got the right, but I can't help but feel something is up.
Now that they have been granted permission to drive, maybe the ministry will allow them to wear something that enables them to see where they are going.
Am not happy with them
That's cool they should have been done that it's 2017 kinda scary sometimes in the USA driving next to someone with a mask on their face
Any ideas on how to deal with women drivers on the road?are they good/bad drivers?i need to prepare myself for the worse
we. are. truly. FUCKED. NOW!!!!!   whatever happened. to. what. GOD. said.  about. women. driving....teaching... going. to. school....working....THINKING.... self. pleasuring?????
Women for Pity's Sake Don't Drive. Lol\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEWWTV8Xbg
about fucking time you joined the rest of the CIVILIZED world saudi arabia. now if you would stop acting like scum beating your women and covering them up like ghosts and murdering the people of yeman that would be nice as well
All this time women weren't allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia, but they were allowed to fly planes. Funny.
Imagine a car accident happening between a man and a woman, they would kill the woman for trying seduce the man and provoke sexual connections with him.
Now all Saudi guys pay a Lambo Aventador to their wives (or Bugatti Chiron)
For a transition period the husband with a flag must walk in front of the woman driver.
only if her harem leader allows it
sand ninjas are allowed to drive now?
now i know nxt year No Driving License for Expats Salaried below $800..very nice
Amazing news!! Congrats to all women in the Kingdom. You can find out more here, too: http://l.expatwoman.com/saudiwomenallowedtodrive
The accident rate will climb. How can they drive correctly when they are wearing a blanket over their heads. Add the sunglasses and all they will be able to see is forward. Turning their head will be difficult.
If they want to drive I don't care but I'll not let my family female  member drive car
Finally after all this years Thanx King
As long as they don't get the right to vote.
OH Sweet heart - now we can meet to park my car in your garage!  Change oil and filter as often as revenge!
Happy Independence day Women
Women can drive.....but beatings, stabbings, beheadings, and female genetil mutilation will continue as normal!!!!!!!!!! ( what a deplorable vile evil disgusting man controlling barbaric repugnant repulsive cult )
Well that's progress, now if they really want to show that they're evolving beyond what all other nations have, they should ban Asians from driving.
Good to see them join the 20th century.
WHOOOO...WOMEN RULE AS DRIVERS...😁😁😁....HURTING OVARIES....LOOOOL....ANY EXCUSE TO SAY TO BAN WOMEN
The Nineteenth century you idiot!\nWestern Women could drive in the Nineteenth century \nEmelia Airheart was flying fucking plans in the Twentieth century and a few in space!!\nHe loves the snippy remarks but is an idiotic thinker😎\nA bit late Saud... let's step over the next line quicker aswell
NNNNNOOOOOooooooooo!!!!!!!!\nIf they do that I'm sending them my ex-wife's insurance record to prove how wrong they are!
if women were that pathetic... then they obviously wouldn't had been soldiers or able to drive! The fact some women do become generals and able to drive means it shows you that women can do it! Men causes the most crimes then women? Does this mean we should kill all men? No lol!
great they just doubled the chances for car bombers over there...  now we're gonna start seeing twice as many attacks on tv....
That won't last long! Can they rape a car?
Well now i'll see what people have to say about saudi. Ahhh i love the gulf arab states😍😍. I hate journalism these days...so poor and unprofessional.
That's really great news to hear. It is a new positive start for every Saudi women. I hope that 2030 will lead to a new prosperous era.
Wow, this is HUGE!
Sigh... i expect sooo many car accidents
Yeah, but they're only allowed to drive to the jail to be tortured for driving.
#Trump2020
Fucking backwards pos mysogynistic culture!
Omg
really ✌️
Ooooooooo. Sooooooo progressive. They can drive to gay stoning. How fucking progressive! Eat shit, Muslims.
Who cares
السلام عليكم أنا مسلمة شقيقة ، يرجى الذهاب إلى هذا الرابط الاشتراك في القناة و وضع على موقع يوتيوب يرجى سبيل الله
على زبي  انت والويمن الي تقولها ي معرسس
Saudi government must make a separate lanes for women\nWe all know how women drive cars
big mistake Saudi........they will become whores and feminist sluts now
I thought they were camel riders??
This is normal\nbackward countries are allies of america
Before they used to say saudi women cant vote saudi arabia is a backward country then women started voting,then they said women cant drive saudi arabia is a backward country, now women cant drive whats next?
All of you you are stupid and whoever watch the fucks news is stupid. One maniac stupid person said driving effects woman ovaries 4 years ago and you go wipe all saudis with the same brush. Thats plain stupid.
CAMEL NINJAS CAN DRIVE NOW WOW
This is not freeing women!. Next send your women out to work then take of your Islamic dress and then have haram sex then go to night clubs and then they will get you to leave Islam!!! Next they going to get them to leave Islam. Dajjal
Ladies & Gentlemen,\n\nIt is time for Saudi people to be opened to the World because many countries want to invest there and also we foreigners ask to the Saudi government to have freedom of religion, speech, press, think, drive, fuck without being married and many earth things.
ALLAHU AKBAR! Allah is so Loving that he let women drive now. Now women can go shopping for husband without husband having to get up off couch and stop eat kebab flavor potato chip! FUCKING YEAH! 'RABIA
Hi there! I'm a 24 years old Saudi gentleman \nfor the ones who say welcome to the 20th century I would like to say thank u so much we wish u all the best in life as will as in the afterlife
Insurance is about to go up LOL
The first five years of Car Insurance in Saudi Arabia is a nice business opportunity.\nCan't wait for the dashcam videos to hit YouTube. \nIt will be better than the Russian car accidents.
Yeah, only problem, if they run a red light they get stoned to death.
omg please don't let  Women  drive.The Horror
Head of the religious fatwas Sheikh Saad Al Hajari SAID Women not equal to men, have OLY quarter of a brain, and don't deserve to drive.  So don't do it Saudi Arabia or ur men with full brain will be jobless & useless.. Haha....
Nice job SA! Welcome to 1926!
But please DONT let them vote!!!
hahahhahahahahahaha
You do know we have personal drivers right? And your telling me we are backwards 😂😂😂😂😂
wow..
Freaking we will regret it big time. Women are stupid as fuck when they drive LMAO. Witnessed it during my 7 years scholarship in the US.
لا نسمح بذلك\nلكي لا نصبح مثلكم \nالزنا يحدث في العلن
who want suck my dick? CNN or Fox news? one of them I will choose
Allah is gonna be pissed
my favorite way to visualize a woman driving is them locking the brakes while sliding on ice about to hit the rear of another vehicle while gripping the wheel and saying what'do i do?!? and then...BAM! so she gets out and immediately starts texting on her phone.
Glad to see Islam is reforming.
Many men now mock and say that it is impossible for their women or drive \nBUT wake up it is 21 century \nWomen drive and it is not the end of the world \nThey will learn and everything will be fine
لا ابوكم لا ابو من جمعكم اجانب عيال كلب
When we are going to see American women not used as objects in magazines and porn American movies...etc
Must be ISIS, new way to mass murder, allow women to drive.
By the way, I am from Saudi Arabia and I think that the decision is not useful because every Saudi family have their own drivers
👉 THIS IS #FakeNews!!!\n👉 NO #MUSLIM MAN WILL ALLOW THEIR WIVES, DAUGHTERS, SISTERS TO DRIVE!!!
Buckle up.

Any chance you could do an 18+ meet up? You mentioned it a while back - like cocktails perhaps for those of us who are a little bit older?
New looks amazing your hair!
I like how Dan is giving the couch a massage.
I don't want to be mean but goddamn it Louise \nI'm so hungry \nThere was food in this video so many times and now I want all \nI want doughnuts...
Louise I loved your hair when you went to visit dan and phil, when one side was pulled back slightly! Looked really nice on you :) xxx
I’m a big sister to a 6 year old and an 8 year old you’re not alone, the battles we have getting them to drink is ridiculous they have bottles of drink throughout the day but they just forget to drink, I’m nearly 20 and find it weird because I never was like this when I was younger
if she don't like water why push it?
I have 2 nieces at darcys age and what I found is that them having a bottle with times of the day w how much they have to drink and they love it always and drink it ❣
32 YEAR OLD single Mummy here. Officially my fave youtuber, she is smart, beautiful and bloody hilarious. The Richard Medley comment had me in stitches! I saw that interview and couldn't quite believe what he said, very tasteless of him but you handled it with style as usual. Just want to say that it doesn't matter how much bump grows, or how many calories you consume, sex appeal doesn't come in any particular shape or size, you either have it or you don't, and you definitely do! Ps I'm straight (just want to point that out).
Hi! I'm new! This is my first time seeing one of your videos as a friend has recommend that I start watching you! Your very sweet and very very pretty like oh my gosh I'm actually jealous. This is one the most awkward comments I've ever typed but I'm just as awkward irl so...yeah...anyways I'm for sure subscribing ^-^
Cats dont like other cats in the home. I wouldnt personally bring in another cat..
The ways I get my nieces to drink water is 1) a special cup (better with a straw because they will drink more), 2) spa waters with fruit or cucumber etc (helps if you introduce it during a 'spa night' then they think it's special 3) if all else fails, we have an ice crusher and they will eat crushed ice ANY time it's offered!
how does Darcey look so grown up 😫😫😘
So glad it has been a more positive week for you you amazing woman ❤️xxxx
I was laughing at the Richard part 😂 was nice too see Dan and phil
Would any smaller Youtubers and fellow Louise-lovers like to be friends and support each other? ☺️☺️
try sugar free squash or put some fruit in her water x
Im new... lmao
What happy valley on Netflix I'm hooked😳💜
Throw some fruit in a pitcher of water over night! She can pick which fruit and it'll flavor the water and add nutrients!
I'm new I just started watching now *^* already subbed, ur awesome
Caspar: What if it's upside down. 😂
Hiya I’m new love your vlogs 💕
5:21 let her drink water with some fruits or lemon if she likes them, or some sliced cucumber added to her bottle
26:26 made me laugh so much 😂😂 Jim: 'deary me' 😂😂
Thumbing up because I love you, but also for you taking the piss out of Arsehole Madeley! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽💖
The “bird farm” is a pen for pheasants. So they will be kept in there from young age until they are ready to be released for the shooting season ☺️
Looks like you had a blow out with your tyre!
I'm so glad you've had such a lovely week! ❤️ x
This must be so weird but I've watched Lou for six years now! I bloody love this woman even though we don't know each other in real life and it's a one sided friendship but she makes me so happy and she's one of the most genuine on YouTube today. I know I must sound so creepy writing this but she makes me so happy! Hopefully I'll be able to go to an event in the future.
Lol ...Nutella doughnut SHIT ME! Louise you're hilarious that would be my reaction too! Heaven in a doughnut
The water thing, it's ok!!! If she's thirsty, she'll drink. if she's not getting thirsty all day then she's getting enough water in her food and other drink to keep her going. \nI found that giving my kiddo some water or milk right before dinner was good, or with his snack if i wasn't sure if he was really hungry or just peckish.
The Richard Madeley bit was HILARIOUS!!!! x
Your looking really good Louise! Xx
I struggle to get the kids I work with to drink too. I have a box of curly and fun straws for the really resistant children. They're a pain to sterilise but still better than dehydration. We also give a choice between milk or water, so if a child doesn't like water, they have a choice. Putting fruit in (raspberries, lemon etc) can work too for some children.
Dan seems sooooo happy far out!! You do too Louise
This whole entire vlog was so delightful. Oh  my word
aww, i love how giddy and excited dan gets when he's with louise
I'm a new subscriber to your vlogs. I've also got the audio version of your book that I'm really enjoying so excited to pre order the sequel. Hope you are keeping well x
My sister is about to turn 18 and we still have to nag her to drink more water! :')
Does louise still have her other cats?
I'm NEW! And loving all your videos!
I am new. Lol.
my brother is exactly the same with drinking and he's 10!!!
my 5 year old son struggles to drink his water and whats worse is that he only drinks water or hot chocolate. you tell him to drink some and he will take a sip. its so hard . he comes home from school with none drunk too. 😔 x
For your tires, next time check to see if there was any bumps on the side. That can cause blow outs.
I'm currently watching Chesapeake Shores on Netflix and it's so heartwarming and good for my soul
GET THOSE APPS FOR DRINKING WATER AND IT GROWS YOUR PLANT\nI got it on my phone for my sister because she did the same thing
I’m new-ish. I watched you when I was about 12/13, stopped, and now I’m watching again as a 17-almost-18 year old. Started again bc your content has changed, it’s sort of grown with me which is cool! x
I really love the long vlogs!
It was so nice seeing you all together- reminded me of old school YouTube :')
do a rose quartz cosplay hawhaw you fit that role perfectly
You actually get a lot of liquids from foods so it's quite normal for kids who are eating a normal amount to not feel like drinking. I dranks very, very little as a child even when I was playing sports. Also the 8 cups of water a day was mostly made so important by a bottled water company if I recall correctly so that's also a thing :)
I love doughnuts but I can’t eat them 👎🏻😞 I can’t eat wheat or gluten or dairy 😭😭😭😭
Oh your living room is the exact blue I want for my new place!! Absolutely beautiful 😍😍😍 Please could tell me what colour and brand it is? xxx
My son's 8 and it's still a battle to get him to drink!! I feel your pain! We've just had a breakfast battle over a cup of water! But he loves fizzy water & will drink it endlessly!  I try and get him to eat lots of things like Celery, cucumber & melons or he could go a whole day without water!!! Xx
My foster sister (mum is a foster carer) battled with my mum for at least the first 6 months of living with us. Then my mum found a water bottle with her name on and ever since then she drinks the full bottle each day. Give that a go? X
Hey so with the water dislike, My mum used to use cordial (natural ones like lemon or pineapple ones), or we had drink bottles with diffuser's in them so we could add things like strawberries or kiwi fruits
I don't like donuts... I'm sorry they just taste so weird, especially glazed... The only donuts I really like are completely chocolate ones.
Aw, Dan was just adorable in this. He turns into a kid around Louise, I love it XD
Omggg that tyre thing happened to me on the freeway (In australia about 100kms/hr) and i ended up having a car accident its terrifying!!
When the kids don't want to drink water, I usually told them really excited omg u know what can we do, grab a lime 🍋 I cut it open and drop like 5 drops of lemon, and tell them that bc we put lemon there it's not gonna taste like water, and I'll have a glass with them, but idk 😂
Your weekly vlogs honestly make my day when I watch them😂
I am new! I think you're bloody marvellous though! X
I never comment, but I must know where your lovely necklace is from? The one with the pink stone on the middle! It's pretty! X
I never drunk water as a kid and now I drink it all the time, just put a little bit of juice in it and by the time she's older she'll learn to love it on its own
Joe not wanting to touch the baby and Marcus tickling Louise is adorable
For Darcy's water intake there's an app called plant nanny. Maybe that's something you guys can do together that will help. Basically it's the cute little app where you log your water intake throughout the day and it waters a little plant and makes it grow and keeps it alive. So maybe you could download it on your phone and she will enjoy coming to tell you when she drinks so she can water her flowers!
Hahahah weekly nail check ins are an integral part of the vlogs! And those kittens are just too cute 😍
I'm on the p.t.a now hahaha Robin?
I can't wait to see how ignorant Dan and Phil are to all this mummy business, thankfully now they have been enlightened.
Louise and Jim always have the funniest conversations
I'm new!\n\nAs in, this is one of my first videos from you!! :D
Try finding a decaf tea she likes without sugar or milk and if it's too hot for tea just ice it :)
Congrats on having a good week!👍🏻
so i dont like drinking milk but so I drank it when i was younger my mum would buy these chocolate milk straws which u can get in b&m and home bargains....there's ones for water too that might help darcey becuase it cookie flavour etc
Cracking up at the bit about Richard and Judy 😂😂😂
I work in a hair salon that does Kevin Murphy and the salon you went to is by far the most beautiful salon I’ve seen in ages!😍
Omg the shoot footage was so funny! Loved this!!
First let me say that getting involved in your child's educational life is anything but a sad mum alert'. I give you kudos and a gold star on your forehead for joining the PTA and giving of your time and talents to all the children at Darcy's school. Bravo, Louise! \n\nNext, I have to tell you how absolutely gorgeous you look with your no-makeup-makeup look. And even your out-and-about makeup looks seem to have a lighter hand and really accentuates your beauty instead of calling attention to the actual makeup. Love the less is more makeup application. Bottom line, you look absolutely beautiful. Maybe this wonderful week was creating your natural glow. Regardless of the cause, you look amazing!
Have you tried the towel trick with your cats to see if it helps them get on? You just rub the new cats with a towel then rub it on the older cat. And do it the other way. It's essentially just rubbing the scent on them, but it apparently helps them get on because they then recognise the scent so the cats then aren't just strangers ☺️
Please do another book tour for Wilde 2 as I couldn’t come to the last one xx
I'm new!!!!
DAN AND PHIL!!!!
Every time I hear you guys reference Hello World I can't help but think about the travel agency with the same name here in Australia :'D #SozNotSoz
You were at Botley Hil Farmhouse! That is so close to me!
My little brother never drank milk or ate more veggies than carrots. My mum and i sat him down to explain why he needs to drink more and eat a variety of things (not scaring him, but making him aware of the facts). If he had his 5 a day and a glass of milk everyday for 2 weeks, he was allowed £5 to spend on whatever he wanted. We continued the chart format for about 6 weeks and then we scrapped it as it just became part of his routine! Good luck with it louise!
I feel like Louise is a bit self conscious when vlogging. Maybe that's just me. You are beautiful Louise and I love you very much xxxxxxxxx
Glad to hear this week was better for you Louise x
My five year old hardly drinks, he'll only drink water if it's volvic lemon! God help us when milk stops in class because other than that I'm pretty sure he doesn't drink at school x
Dan was hyper😂
Newww
neww

omg rocket!!!! hahahah couldnt stop laughing
Who is Rocket??
Lol hiiii, I'm newww. :3

I would like to apologize to those who are deaf and/or hard of hearing.\nThe end of the video was NOT captioned, I don't know how it got past at least 3 other people in review but it did.\nI've fixed them now, so you can watch with corrected captions now.
It's difficult because the dang sugar has to be kept warm and shit. Then all the flour makes it taste weird. But it works

Now THIS is up our alley 😃 Can't wait! #StayTactical
So excited for pvp
This is gonna be sweet, can't wait for Oct 10th! :D
We have a release date! Can't wait to play this, awesome job ubisoft. I knew it was worth the wait!
I cannot fucking wait to get back into Ghost War! You guys killed it with this, I mean that in a good way just to be clear.
all I want is more ac origins vids
Add Battle royal please🙏🏻
Fist your so good at ghost recon wildlands
I love it as pvp but i don't love it as 4v4, We want it like SOCOM 8v8 and 16v16, There are some problems i will mention, When the enemy throw the gernade why it's so seen why?? It must be unseen you just hear it sound when it hits the ground only, Please don't make the gernade seen to the players, also why you can mark the enemy why?? please guys make it more reality!! You can't mark the enemy in real life! i don't like that you should make the players can't mark each other.
You got to add a battle royal/PUBG mode. it would be very popular if you do it right and the game has all the things it needs like vehicles, weapons and good map
How to tie multiplayer into the main story: 4 Ghosts went Rouge with stolen CIA files the other 4 ghosts tracked them down to a place (name of map here).
At 1:40 a bulletin goes through the wall.
Oh and take away unlimited revives. Once you're dead, you're dead. Not realistic at all.
Quit asking for 6v6, 10v10, 16v16, or Battle Royale. If you want that, go play PUBG or Fortnite (Free to download btw). Ghost War 4v4 brings in PVP to the Wildlands title and sticks with it's gameplay (4 member squads). Looking forward to October 10th and more additional campaign content after. Good job Ubisoft.
Drones were only used in Ai  coop,,,,, on the original ghost recon  not pvp,,,  let alone 4v4,, need a no drone mode! A get rid of all them icons,,, this gtav? Go back to your  ROOTS! Did the kids take over of the company?
Watchdog and watchdog 2 are the reasons why I have trust issues..hope this will not disappoint me
Make a hardcore version of it with the most realistic version that you can, no markers no noise marker and less health with realistic mag reload
this is almost like a new rainbow six siege only outdoors
I hope the start menu for class choice and loadout is different than the open beta was.
dips on the assasin ! cant wait to fck some people up with the vector lol
Beta was decent (no choice but to play seeing as how I've already paid for it) but in a way it feels it will be limited, be awesome if Ubisoft put as much effort in the game instead of these badass videos lol
I just love the customizations that you can put on your own unit.
I had so much damn fun winning and losing playing this pvp I can’t wait
I hope this is not regionally blocked again.
If this is 4/4, where's 3/4?!!!
can not be 4 vs4 because this game is so easy
This game is one of my favorite shooters for the sheer variety of ways you can approach any objective. Please keep making third person type shooters, I hate Cod clones.
Is it wrong to be sexually attracted to this? BTW, add a Hitman class, with a suppressed pistol and a drone that marks enemies and explode without being detected to make up for it's lack of firepower
Question: am I the only person who really just wants that masks the Assassin had? Yeah, pvp will be fun, but dang it Ubisoft, I want that mask
Sounds awesome can't wait to play...however I believe marking is way to easy it takes away the difficulty it also takes away the chance of players to try and lose the enemy when they are found PLS CONSIDER THIS
That assassin mask better be available in single player and co-op...
Did they add flash lights yet?
Does anyone know if the time Standalone comes out the same day as the update?
Not a lot of folks played the beta (Xbox1) they missed out. Let's hope we get a big turnout and Ubisoft stays with dedicated servers. This game will not be a sleeper.
Remove Cote to kick on rainbow six
Is this worth the 7 month WAIT? I'm very Salty about this, they are doing a peer to peer like For Honor. What a Joke UBISOFT! Plus there Isn't a Penalty for the RAGE quitters, which hangs you up in a middle of a match at-least 10 minutes for a replacement for the other team. The Beta was Sweet AZZ besides these 2 Major Issues. I'm not saying we are the best Squad out there, Team Infidels. But spending 70% of the gameplay time waiting on Q for replacements of the opposite Team, sucks Ballz Ubisoft. When released we will Share some Videos called WILDLANDS RAGE.
Rainbow Six Siege in 3RD PERSON!
They look a bit...Soft. Like when a Japanese game has female soldiers and they all look like models.
I requested the day off from work for this day under the category Personal Time Off. 😂🎮
very good game would be good each one by itself, and conquest of the same as the previous ghost recon and consider the preparation time add a little more...
Assasin and Pointman.. i'm a fcking ninja
Did you release this before releasing 3? Cause its says Class Trailer 4/4 and I only see 1,2,4 not 3 xD At least on this Channel IGN has them all xD
OH lordie lord please don't let this dlc have achievements on this I've already completed this 100% and I do not want to go back to this game.
This has become one of the GREATEST shooters of ALL time!i couldnt stop playing the Beta and now a release date,CANT WAIT!!!👍😃
well i guess its about time they release a damn pvp mode lol! looks kinda unique too lol
Okay, the only issue I have. Where is Trailer 3? It jumps from 2 to 4
Can’t wait! It’s been a hot min but ready to go ghost lol
invisible drone is a bad idea
Can the assassin climb roofs, leap into bales of hay, and kill people with hidden blades though?
Still not better then Rainbow six siege 😏
You dont grecee
Ghost Recon Is Back In Business !
Release date Finally! So excited for the full launch
I am erect.
Meh...
Я один тут русский?
Iam hard
Segundo comentario
Ah sí cheeeee...
I think all the classes in the game are well balanced. Drones need to be limited and they need to fix the marking.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Niceeee
yesssssss
7th comment
3rd comment
Yeesssss
bruh
#ChildOfLight2
omg omg so excited!!!!
🥇
Did somebody said assassin?
Assassin = OP
Enforcer for life
Nice job.
Das Spiel ist schiesse
Awesomeness.
Hyypppee
Is free updateeeee
Really
The assassin is my favorite class of all time
Amazing mode
Oh
What happened to the third trailer?
Wouldn't want that sniper on my team.
How about a rebel ops PVP game mode where one team in the building protects the radio from the other team who raids the building... \n👍👍👍
While I liked the beta I do hope is more modes to keep us playing a bigger map with say a 30min time limit most kills wins.
Can u tell me the release of the pvp?
Do i agree ? That everyone here loves a big booty ?😏
Everybody comment their favorite classes
Hello UBISOFT! i saw some problems that ruins the game, First the gernade is so weak and it's seen to the all players so this is so bad for the players it doesn't give excitement to the game, If you make the gernade like SOMCOM no one sees the gernade only you hear it sound when it hits the ground and then you die lol it will be really exciting and great for the players. Second problem is when you see your enemy and start firing the enemy gets marked so this is really bad because the enemy was my victim if the enemy got marked all my team would start firing. I love the game but i hope you fix these problems i mentioned, Make it real make it like SOCOM, Trust me if you did! all the people would play this game.
That mask on the assassin looks cool, wish we actually had that as a customization option.
That drone seems cheap allrdy lol
hello ubisoft where is 3/4
DOubtful i'll drop $60 for the full game, but I'd totally pay $30 for a standalone ghost war game...
Hey ubisoft You sock at all games You make but rainbow six You need to kick all The hackers and all The gliches😡
I don't like the idea of pvp in this game.
why not 10 vs 10 ???????????????
I can not play games , cause I have no GPU.
Do you actually /need/ to get down to fewer than 16 t-shirts? Maybe you do because of limited storage, but I don't think you should put yourself through the stress of getting rid of something you love and do wear just for the sake of achieving an ideal number.
I don't think 16 shirts makes you a t-shirt hoarder at all! You love to wear them, so it makes total sense to have a few of them (and again, 16 is not like a huge amount!). For me it seems absolutely fine to keep all of them, doing some kind of rotation system, or, if you really want to reduce, keep track of wich ones you wear the least ( and if those are the ones designed by your friends, or having some other sort of emotional value, make something else out of them! Like framing one like a picture, or sewing a t-shirt-quilt (i did that, it's awesome!)) Loved the video, please keep us updated! xx
YES LUCY! This video is literally like porn for me X
A channel that you might like all about fashion, focusing particularly on capsule wardrobes is Justine Leconte Official. She's a french fashion designer and her videos are super duper helpful!!
I'm currently working on refining my wardrobe ~ I'm slowly donating or passing onto friends (my local charity shops love me 😆). Autumn is just about a big oversized orangey - maroon jumper with black skinny jeans or leggings and a black or burgandy pinafore with tights and boots for me.
I've been obsessed with these vids lately ad I'm really glad you've made one
Please do a video where you make a spread of your whole wardrobe!
hi lucy! i love your content and you're so inspiring as a person in general, thank you for doing what you do! \n\ni've always had the same problem with t shirts, so my mom has taken my old t shirts and she's starting to make a quilt out of them, even if quilting isn't your thing there's plenty of ways to make simple and cute blankets with old t shirts you don't wear anymore! it's especially nice because you can still keep them with you while bettering your wardrobe((:
With mom jeans I pick up oversized jeans from charity shops and I got a pair from a kilo sale and sew them to fit me meaning they can be as loose or tailored as I want so if you know someone that’s good on a sewing machine it’s a very good and affordable way to get mom jeans that fit perfectly
Your bullet journal is so nice!
I make all of my own clothes because that avoids the human exploitation/sweatshop element of lots of popular brands, and also makes me think carefully about what I really need. This season I'm making black jeans, a grey blazer and a colourful blazer, a nice black shirt, and some leggings for layering.
I want a denim jacket so badly, but they're so dang expensive :O
Is that real fur?
I'm also kinda trying to start a capsule wardrobe, and what really helped me was to turn the clothes hangers around so you can see what you actually wear. And I love watching your videos. You are amazing!!!
Wow that pie chart tip is actually so useful!!
yesssss! more fashion videos! I live for these, I love your fashion sense so much!
Lucy you should do some bullet journal videos!! Like monthly spreads and plan with me and stuff ✨💘
YESSS LOVE IT - capsule wardrobe planning has been such a long process for me (i started about two years ago and I'm trying to curate an all year round capsule wardrobe that works for all seasons) just because I'm super hesitant to buy things and tend to buy just a few things a year. Also in the past two years I've learnt a lot more about my style and realised that ultimately I need to dress in clothes that I feel good in not clothes that I think will impress other people, so I'm not done yet...but I'm getting there! Can't wait to see how yours turn out, I LOVE your style <3
Really like that you planned it out on the paper! I also did a capsule wardrobe video for fall. Check it out if interested :)
you should do a giveaway with your tshirts that you know 100% you won’t ever wear
I need to do this. I'm moving soon and need to cut down significantly. I have clothes in my wardrobe from 10 years ago and items I've never worn but kept just in case and about 70% don't fit me. I need even less clothing than you do as I wear a uniform to work. So I need 3-4 outfits a week and the rest of the time I'm in pjs. I'm gonna get planning
Try to consider the maintenance of pieces you want to get or pieces you already have. I find it a lot more difficult to wear certain items of clothing because they require more maintenance than some others that get worn almost regularly. \nAnd also, about the 16 t-shirts, just go through and see what really flatters your body type. That applies to all your clothing, anything that doesn’t flatter or make you comfortable should automatically go into storage, because your daily wear (even formal wear) should be 100% the most comfortable stuff ever ever for you (whether physical or mental comfort).\nCheers 💃🏼
This makes me want to go out charity shopping, which I love doing. I may use the excuse of 'needing black work trousers' to go do some soon!
I love your comments about mom jeans because I thought I was fooling myself into thinking they were just not suited to my body. Ahh I feel so much better now!!
lovely video but i'm just lowkey crying because here is Spring not autumn
Hey people, would you mind checking out @ThinkingOfThing on Twitter? My goal is just to make this dreary world a bit more positive :))\nThanks so much xx
Great advice! Shop currentandcompany.us to find high-quality, affordable pieces for your capsule wardrobe!
I started this process last night! So timely!!
i swear if i had more money/freedom i'd be drowning in socks, jumpers, skirts, sundresses, sneakers and i'd have a wide brim hat that's actually big enough for my damn head
you said scarfs at one point  - are there styles or colors that you're gravitating to there? winter is coming ;-)
I love your style! I am someone who also tries to keep my wardrobe down to versatile items but there are one pieces I own which are fancier and can only be used for nice events but I love them so I don't mind that they are less versatile! You do you, I don't think it's a bad thing to have lots of tshirts if you love them- just store them away because you might regret getting rid of them in the future☺️
Can you do another bullet journal video?
For tshirts, something that I have done (which isn't for everyone) is made them into a quilt! My friend took my shirts and made them into squares then makes the back out of fleece and for me it's the perfect mix of keeping sentimental shirts but paring down my clothes
I wear a uniform for work, and work three to four days a week. on days I work I dont do anything else (ie, no need for real people clothes on those days) so I really only need 3-4 outfits for every season. realizing that was pretty much life changing.
How do you accidentally buy something?
Love this! Planning my capsule wardrobe now😂 x
if you like capsule wardrobe and fashion channels i recommend justine leconte. She is a french designer who makes quick and concise videos about fashion and one of her series is about capsule wardrobes.
Storing some of the t-shirts sounds like a great idea. That really appeals to me because rotating them out rather than downsizing outright should help them all last longer, which has started to become an issue for me in the last couple of years. So for t-shirts, I think it makes a lot of sense...because you can wear them, preserve them, and have a streamlined everyday wardrobe, all at the same time.\n\nI definitely need to downsize my wardrobe, but most of that is things that don't fit but I really want to fit into again sometime in the future. And things that are redundant from living at uni _and_ at home.... I think this might actually help me? Which is just unexpected because I'm not a woman and I don't really buy clothes. ^^;;
Oh my gosh! WHERE is the pink coat from? ❤️❤️❤️
Have you considered making something like a quilt out if your t shirts you adore but don't necessarily want to wear constantly? Like a t shirt quilt or tapestry? Combine textures and other squares that go with your t shirts into a quilt type thing to snuggle with or hang in a room? Just a thought!
please do a lookbook once you have it organised x
Damn trending Lucy!!!! Wooooo, such a great video so highly deserved x
Could you do a video abt fuckboys part II? im living for those
It would mean the world to me if your could subscribe to my channel!! Xx 😘
Pls pls pls can I beat my brother In a bet and get 100 subs in 2 days xxx
A big mistake a lot of people make when doing capsules is that they discard items that do not fit into their capsules. If you are not feeling hot pink right now - put them away and in february, check if you are feeling them for early spring, for example. If you like an item but it does not fit into your capsule *right now*, it might in a year or 5. I bougth a pair of trousers in 2014 that fit perfectly with my FW17/18 capsule... It takes time to find what fits you so you are bound to experiment along the road.
i love this video & i don't really know why
Hi Lucy! I have a few questions :) when you build a capsule wardrobe, does it work for all seasons? or is it like okay this is my capsule wardrobe for winter and this my wardrobe for spring? I've seen people limiting themselves to a number of pieces (like 52, 30) and I don't know if shoes are counted in too. Loved the video, I'm looking forward to the next one! :)
I used to exclusively wear jeans as bottoms, but then I watched Begin Again and Keira Knighley's effortless and supercool way to pull off smarter trousers opened my eyes to a whole new world. Check it out, Lucy!
where's that gorgeous pink coat from?!😍
With the T-shirts, have a weekly or fortnightly rotation. You'll find you wear those you often don't reach to more often without having to scale the collection down!
If I have too many items that I love but they won't all fit in one wardrobe rotation, I store them then at the beginning of the next season I'll swap out the ones I really love, and if there's any I'm not keen on wearing/haven't worn at all THEN I'll donate them, that way I know I won't wear them and I feel less guilty about it :)
Who says you can't wear all black all the time? lol. \nThis is a neat idea. I'll be interested to see the final result!
i'm debating whether or not to treat myself to a new pair of doc martens next month... my current pair are over five years old and were mistreated throughout high school, so there are holes in the heels and the leather is all cracked. i'd love a new pair but i'm not sure i'll wear them enough to justify their cost, especially considering they can't function as my winter boots because it's way too cold and snowy where i live. we'll see whether or not i get them lol. i also need to go through my clothes again and be harsh in getting rid of things i don't wear and that don't fit me. i've gained like 20 pounds in the last two years so i have a lot of old jeans and shirts that don't fit at all but are still in my dresser taking up space. that'll be a task for.... whenever i have some time to kill, which lbr is a rarity for a uni student who also has a part time job
Lucy be careful of making rules for yourself. It's your wardrobe, if you want a secret 3 bright pink things, then do that. There's no rules if you think about it.
bro i couldn't get my eyes of her frickin lips i feel like a bird ~sHi~Ny~~
PLEASE do a look book
I get if you want to wear them, but you could always frame a t-shirt or two that your friends designed.
i think you're putting unnecessary pressure on yourself about the amount of things you can have. i'm the same way with my tshirts, and that's ok. if it's something that brings you joy, or you feel good in, or means something to you... keep it! and don't pack them away! you love them and you'll wear them, so they get to stay. don't worry about it so much.
i have the same problem with t-shirts! i have so many that have sentimental value to me and for that reason i'm not willing to part with them, but at the same time i don't wear them as much as a person with a ton of shirts should! i've been thinking of making a t-shirt quilt out of them, bc that way it's clearing out my closet, but i still get to keep the t-shirts around in a useful way.
If you could get someone to send them to you, I feel like you could live in these pants https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-italian-goweave-easy-pant-black?collection=womens-bottoms
This video has inspired me to do something about the explosion of clothes in my room, so thank you! haha Also I love the way you organised the whole thing starting with what you regularly do and what outfits you need for those things and going from there. Maybe I will reach that point in my organisational skills someday lol
Have you considered making a t-shirt quilt? You still get to keep the designs and the memories they bring without having them take up much room in your closet
It's 30+ degrees weather over here in Toronto dont ask me how
Not a very interesting video,
I have Nathan Zeds good enough t-shirt in the post too 😂
your style is absolutely stunning, you inspire me so much
is a jumper like a sweatshirt/sweater?
if you love them keep them! It's all about having stuff you love and will actually use, not just getting your wardrobe down to a specific number.
u should put some of th ones u dont rlly wear on depop !!!
Fab video! I feel like it would be a bit more engaging if you did some b roll of what you're talking about & the process!\nLoved the video and I hope there's more capsule ones to come xx
I would recommend to be flexible about the item number or pieces. If you really like and use tshirts you don't need to get rid of them just to fit in the capsule wardrobe standard. This is a really marvelous concept but I think one should adapt it to it's own needs and taste. Good luck!
It's so refreshing to see a practical take on reconfiguring a wardrobe/closet! I had to do this when I started my job several years ago and now I like to think shopping is a matter of plugging in holes and thinking carefully before making purchases (my impulse only seem to be things I've stalked for months or years).\n\nI also have had your problem regarding the fit of pants and jeans and learned that a good tailor completely solved the problem so am so happy you've sent some stuff off! I had the same gaping waist/sagging crotch issue and the tailor made them fit perfectly each time. It's annoying that so many pants/jeans seem to be constructed in a way that do not accommodate normal hips, but I'm grateful to have a good and decently priced tailor around. A good cobbler is also life changing for maintaining shoes and boots!
Not to give away my secrets but if you want recommendations light before dark is THE place for semi casual trousers
I love the idea of a capsule wardrobe but it seems like so much work, plus I'm at university so I have zero money for clothes. Your capsule wardrobe so so nice, you should some fashion videos once you get it all sorted. X
Since you have good music taste, what's your opinion about this good track, Lucy Moon?\nThe Midnight - Crystalline\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iLX7eWwmE
i think with your t-shirt problem you could keep them all at least for a while and even switch them up during the 3 month capsule cycle. this way it might help if you ever get the feeling you want to buy a new t-shirt. cause then you can just go the ones you already own and switch things up. even old stuff feels like new when it's been out of your sight for awhile. after awhile i'm sure you'll notice if there are ones that you never really feel like including into your capsule. and then it might be easier to get rid of those.
wow i'm such a  t-shirt hoarder as well 😩 this vid has kinda inspired me to do a t-shirt clear out this week hahah
I just love people talking about style/clothes
I got so many jumpers on new looks sale page! have a look :)
Could we switch parts of our wardrobe, I have WAY too many jumpers (around 20...) but not that many basic t-shirts.
if your looking for good quality more affordable jumpers try pull and bear x
Lucy, I tend to have the exact same problem with wanting to keep sentimental t-shirts. Sadly, because I have a shorter torso, normal shaped t-shirts look really weird on me because they are either too long or too bunchy, so I never get around to wearing them. But I still really want to preserve those memories. Ive found online that some people turn their old t-shirts into quilts! You can still enjoy all of the memories associated with them without having to actually wear them. Maybe that is a possible solution to your t-shirt problem?
Excited for the sequal of whatever this is :)
Try the pureple app, its a wardrobe app, you add photos of your clothes which helps you keep track of what you own, you can create or be suggested outfits and that helps to see what you actually wear or not, ive had this app for years and i swear by it
I'm sure someone has already said but what about making a blanket out of your excess tshirts? Pinterest will have great examples no doubt!
I've learnt about capsule wardrobing from Justine Leconte (she's an incredible fashion youtuber, definitely recommend) but I've been waiting until summer to do my capsule wardrobe for two reasons: firstly, Australia doesn't really have 4 seasons.... autumn and spring just consists of alternating summer and winter days or weeks (it's not a stable temperature), and secondly, I'll be finished with my uni semester in November so I'll have more time to do it. I also have a new wardrobe which I don't have the space for so when I start sorting through my clothes, I'll ditch my current one (and maybe my clothes rack since I have no space for it) and buy a small chest of drawers.
This has inspired me so, so much to try out a capsule wardrobe. Your tips were so helpful, Lucy. X
I've been working on the same thing! I'm the same way with t-shirts. If they're graphic tees you can hire someone to make you a t-shirt quilt. I had it made with all of my school shirts and memories and things I was holding onto. The back is lined in fleece and it's super cozy! Could be a good way to keep the memories of the shirts but turn them into something new :)
I miss your discussion videos
Want month faves back! <3
Hell yes to period slobbing clothes!
Whats your haircut called ?
Lovely video, Lucy! <3
Lucy 💕✨🌸
Hey girl! If you're shopping on the high street for mom jeans it's almost impossible to get a good fit, my tip would go vintage or second hand, the quality and fits are way better. I usually go for the men's section and get a levis 504 or 505 but it's really about finding the best shape for you, I'd also size up one or two sizes as the denim is mostly non stretch. Just thought it might be worth a mention because it can be really hard to have jeans tailored in a non obvious way, so excited for this project!!
Slippers for around the house are also the best 10 pound investment that you'll ever make
Lucy!! I want to send you a sustainable plain white button down shirt.  What address should I send it to??
If you don't watch The Anna Edit, I highly recommend it. She's got capsule wardrobe down to an art (albeit a pretty expensive one).
You guys are so great! I've been following you all for 3 years and I love watching your food adventures. Recently I found out I have adult food allergies, like last week, and all the food I love is no longer allowed (like soy, corn, rice, oats, chicken, and wheat as well as anything derived from these products). It's a dream of mine to travel abroad but I'm scared I won't be able to get around with all my allergies. Would you ever consider going to an allergies free place, if it exists? you guys rock my socks thanks!
PLEASE in the love of god is there any way you could visit the mannenji temple answere me back if it's not possible
Just got to say: isn't Martina always wishing she was eating Coco Curry?
You should do a COLLAB WITH NEKOTITABLOG!!!!
Love when you try vegan and tell us all about it! And they said you couldn’t be vegan in Japan! Would be great if you were completely vegan but appreciate your openness . ❤️🌱
If you guys tried this have you tried Ivan Orkin's place in japan?
lol Martina take back the night then later he's like come here girl
I'm super happy that you guys are open to trying vegan foods, even though some people wouldn't even try it because ohhhhh itssssd vegaaaaaannnnn
Maaaan.. No garlic,onion,chives,green onions and leeks?! In every dish I make, they are all present!\nI was going to ask you, 'Why would you even vegan?!' I'm glad you guys like it though. That man need an assistant..
I haven't watched ya guys in forever... when did Simon have that large of a head
I want to see what you guys think of Korea town in Shinokubo!
I'm still waiting patiently for the Japanese bakery video. My favorite is Gebacken in Kyoto. Love ya, Simon and Martina!
post some bad food videos! I want to see some food that aren't good in Japan for a change!
Fuck me. Im OV but didnt know about the the title. This will make it easier searching for recipes.
is there a vegetarian place tho ... give me the eggs at least AHHHHHHHH eggs please ....omg and no garlic TT
Liking this video just for the 'Simon is too big...Simon is too hot...Simon is too whiny segment 😂😂😂
why do you guys delete videos of places you don't like?? shouldn't you show the good and the bad?
Please do more vegan/ vegetarian food vids in Japan!!!
Vegan is definitely not blan or boring that was totally a misconception I had 😉 Thanks for giving vegan food a try!
There is a vegan ramen shop in melbourne called Neko Neko (Cat Cat) on Gertrude Street. The place is cute with many references to cats and the ramen is awesome!
Yes I have been there. It was freaking awesome!!!!
@sharmander @taylorr you should visit this place :)
I absolutely adore your videos! I'm glad you guys came back to make videos!!
Ate Ramen while I watched this
Post some of the footage from places you guys hated! I think that would be hilarious to see what foods you didn’t like. Throw back to old school Korean toast video XD
Vegans aren't making a difference in the world
Yummm! I've been waiting for the vegan Ramen video! So glad you finally found one that made the cut. My favorite vegan restaurant is in Winter Park, Florida and it's called Vegan Café. They have the BEST menu filled with yumminess from Summer special Bean Burritos to Hawaiian Pizza. Sooo good!!
As someone who's Fodmap AND doesn't eat pork I teared up when I saw they had OV. I never knew it was a thing over there :O Time to go back to Japan for a third time! :D
why do I watch this when I'm in a hurry and have no time to fix breakfast?!
God I want some good vegan ramen. I settle for pho, because we have a lot of Vietnamese restaurants around here. A significant lack of ramen places, though. :(
May I know what kind of phone casing is Martina using, 1:07? Is it available on Amazon?
Simon an Martinez really you guess remind me and my boyfriend of us. We also giggles in happienss when you post sweats and pastries! So those are our favorites 😊😊😊😇😇😘😍😚 I also share pain maybe not as much as you but I share that feeling of depression and other pain. I understand you don't like pitty party's I do not either they make it hard to get out of the black hole of sadness that is every day. .. So seriously you can't die not yet not by your own cute adorable hands because everyone like us who has pain. We were born for a reason that reason is to feel all life has to give us in return for the suffering.  Even if it's not a good day there will be one and seeing you strive on inspires me not to hit the K.O button on this game of life... So please push on and hope to meet you one day.  Even if I have to fly all the way to Japan to just get to meet you I will. :') I love you Mar-Mar please don't stop being Kawaii and living. And *hugs and baths* for all the bad days!.....(seriously I mean it... You inspire me)... Ugh I am a dork and this was maybe the wrong way to get in touch but I watch every upload even if it takes weeks I do.... Cause I am stuck inside most days... So yeah lol love you lots 😍
Thank you for making a video for vegans!!!! Much appreciated
Still waiting for the peach video... so I watched the ad before the video.
im suddenly reminded of that time when martina lost a game and threw simon's cupcake on the wall lol
Awesome that you don't promote places that you dont like. I think oriental vegetarian is the same as Jain vegetarian (milk is allowed strange, but no potatoes) im also pretty sure soy meat (daizuniku) is the same as TVP (textured vegetable protein)
if they dont like eggs then they should try fake eggs from china
Can you guys do an updated how to eat ramen like a pro ???
Simon is getting better at pinching food with Japanese chop-sticks and used to Japanese life style such as towel handkerchief. Also eating noodles with putting them on spoon is good manner for those who feel hesitation to slurp.
They also have vegan ramen at t's tin tin in tokyo station!
I’m so happy you did a vegan video! I have not been able to get into your videos sense going vegan!
Not on my Christian app
Vegan food is soooo good!  Glad you know it now. lol
Can you guises do more videos about OV food? Or midnight cooking the divine pickles you two love? 💜
While I'm sure it's delicious, my favorite part of ramen is the eggs, so I'll probably just stick to the non vegan version, lol but i definitely have friends i might have to recommend this to!
I'm hungry now
I hope the chef is going to move to London.
It was meant to be - I'm heading to Japan in little over 2 weeks and I've been thinking abt searching around for some ramen I could eat as I'm vegetarian - and guess what - we are freaking staying 1km away from that restuarant! ahahahahaha thank you for showing this, I will go there for sure.
who can Roman be vegan Roman it's  almost rice as it ia
Oh god this was such a great video. The sweat rag was hilarious
NO!!!! STOP RUINING FOOD VEGANS!!!!!! GO BACK AND EAT YOUR TREES!
It.Looks.Amazing! I miss ramen so much, I just moved to Miami FL from Vancouver BC and the thing I miss the most is ramen!! I have not found any ramen restaurants yet ;___:
You can tell how healthy the oil is by the colour of it.\n\nWoah.
You delete the videos of restaurants you didn't like? That used to be one of the great aspects of FAPFAP, the Korean cheese toast place was an awesome episode.
Thank you so much for uploading a video like this, now i feel hopeful to find a vegan/vegetarian place in Japan.
You guys help me to imagine the good taste of the ramen. The cold is killing my sense of taste. xD
I eat meat, yet I want to eat vegan ramen now.\n\nI'm wondering though, is it possible to make vegan ramen wrong?
Nothing vegan is good except for straight fruits and vegetables. Fuck vegans.
YAY FOR BEING VEGAN and actually caring about the world😂😂
Please try the limited edition Halloween cola secret flavor in Japan 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Vegan Ramen is AMAZING. It's my new favorite.  Try it. ;)
Martina, your fruit themed accessories are adorable!
Bwahahaha! 😂 Poor Simon.... 🤣
More veg food vids pleeeeease!
Do people cater to gluten allergies there?
yes! Please more videos like this :D love more FapFap style  videos. Gah I miss FapFaps, eat your sushi segments, WTFs and TLDRs :(
Wow the place has halal ramen too? Amaziingg
love your earrings Martina!
Burn it
Nope.
Isn't Coco curry always applicable XD
Awesome!  Do more vegan/veggy places 😄
Answer: Fuck no
Vegan Ramen 😤😐 boi just eat the fucking meat
You mean Raman noodles
your earrings are so cute martina! ✨
SO PUMPED
I love some Pye Ying!
Soy meat is delicious!!
Simonnnm, are u bald? SQUIDWAARRRRRD
Dump the ramen crap, whole grains please
u\ng\nl\n*
Actual question. Is vegan anything really good? Answer- no.
As a vegan this really raises my hopes for travels to Japan! And also I'm thrilled that Simon eats ramen the same way I do - noodles onto spoon
#40 on trending?! Whaaaat
TAKE BACK THE NIGHT!!!
what video program do you use for your youtube videos?
Martina, I remember how you have that joint inflammation/pain problem(can't remember what it's called since I watched that video such a long time ago) but I just wanted to put this idea in your head. You should research people that have the same thing as you that have switched to a whole foods plant based diet. I remember researching it and seeing so many good things reported, which happens with every disease when people make the switch. Eating whole foods most of the time and then splurging on a place like this is so doable. There are so many plantbased/vegan channels on YouTube now that any dish can be easily veganized with lots of variety on how healthy and simple or how processed you want the recipe to be. I hope you research it a little just to know if you have other options you would like to pursue. Love you guys and hope you are both doing well 😊
well I still love you no matter what you eat  I personally am against Veganism for the sake of it if it for religious reasons I can get behind it  but my point is we all eat we all consume  we are on the top of the food-chain  .. I have met some really laid back chill Vegan, and Vegetarians that are really cool people  who do  not judge me for my food choices and I have nothing but warm fuzzies for them   I just wish everybody would do that when it comes to it because food is about  community and cherishing your neighbor ... I love you guys and your message so please keep doing what you are doing
You guys make videos you don't publish? How often does it happen that you don't enjoy a restaurant that you review?
wait, you dont upload things you dont like?
i feel like I've seen this video before... have you done a sneak peek of it?
I've been suscribed for some years now it makes me really, REALLY happy when I see you guys go to vegetarian/vegan places and enjoy the food :) as I am a longtime vegetarian/recent vegan. Keep it up guys and lots of love from Mexico!
Fuck, I have to go to Japan!!!!!!! I envy my cousin since she works for a Japanese Airline 😢 but I hate airplanes 😪
Yay! Vegan things on trending videos 🌱💚
Not all Vegan Ramen are good 💁 i have a Ramen store around the corner , it belongs to a Russian guy that lived 30 years in Japan and he knows how to make really good japanese food. He also has Vegan Noodles but they are very stiff. Also his Vegan broth is tastes like Miso soup and is very boring. The normal beef/pork soup is very good even without chunks of meat so it is ~kinda vegetarian for those who dont like meat textures. However vegans will always say sth is delicious even if its hidious 😂
yay you guys are on trending! :)
Running out of topics? Ramen review....again! How come no episodes with Japanese people about differences/similarities, pop culture subjects (manga, fashion, anime, movies), onsens, talks with other expats, etc....
VEGAN FOOD IS TERRIBLE!\nVirtue signaling liars.
is there a food you dont like ??
Why ARE so many lashes named Samantha?? 😂😂😂
Please do a reacting to your old video get to know me I believe it's called!!
Omg Katy is trending YAAASS 👏🏼👏🏼❤️
“Eww It looks like you’re not even listening to me but you really are”... lol that was cute
Whats that brush you use for concealer, spot conceal idk everything i want ir
i enjoyed the shit out of this video!!!! not a fan of huda beauty but the palette is nice i cant wait to buy fenty have not been lucky @ sephora
Thank you for not messing up your lips like every other youtuber!
the fenty beauty foundation didn't have any shades that remotely match me. The light was too light and the medium is too dark. The other problem I had was that there wasn't one with an undertone for me. I was looking for more of their peach undertone ones because I typically go for the golden undertone foundations that aren't as warm, but no matter how much I tried to mix different foundation shades, nothing matched me AT ALL 😱
I have only tried a sample and the sample I got was too dark for me. However I did love the foundation. It lasted and looked good for a full 12 hours even after I mowed my lawn when it was 80+ degrees out. I can't wait to try it in the correct shade.
Love your videos so much
Anyone else notice Katy’s traps coming through?! Get it girl! 💪🏼💪🏼
That Katy sign is hot fire 🔥
You need to start zooming in your eye balls when do u ur shadow doll face.
Очень много «пиздит»
Thanks for share videos
honestly... fenty beauty has my props for their foundation ranges and how it is made for people of color.. but i've heard SO many people complain about various aspects of the foundation and matchsticks that I feel like no review is true opinions, because they are just trying to please the consumers who do love rihanna.
ou are very inspiring! Love your channel, Lets become youtube friends
I love he idea of a no make up makeup buuut hella like you said....Kinda no makeup make up! lmao
What primer would you recommend for oily skin?
That background is so cute 🍆💜🦑🍇🛰🎵🎶🔮🔯♈♉♊♋♌♍♎♏♐♑♒♓⛎⚜⚕✳⚅🌌
I'm an OG LustreLux follower, and I love your videos.  That is all. Oh! And your background is dope.
THE BACKGROUND HAS ME SHOOK THOUGH
Love your background! I hate to admit it but I only found your channel recently ( your smashbox trip introduced me to you) but i am so happy I did!!
Loved the entire look, but really loved the eye look. Different than what most have done. 😍👁😍 Have to get my hands on that palette. 😍
Katy what lash glue are you using , I have really sensitive eyes and I've tried a bunch 😩
Your background is everything 🖤
the matching stick are quite hard to work on, i didn't like it myself def going to return it :/
If u want a no makeup makeup look but your actually using products try the no makeup makeup line from perricone md! I love it!
Love this look especially the purple vibes you have going on love the @Katy sign to lol
Does anyone know what brush she uses to blend out her concealer? Pls help
love the new background!
I live for the bloopers lol
No fuego?! 🤔 no over the top?! 😭 lol 😂 \nLoved the look, I've seen plenty of looks and I def need this palette in my life 😍 you're just so pretty!!
You literally look like this emoji 🤔 when contemplating the concealer stick 😂😂😂😂like your facial expression is that exact emoji and you should talk to Kim about your face being the contemplating face for KIMOJIs
Jonye's commentary gives me life 😂😂😂
You never do basic looks, their always so different, artsy, and editorial😻🔥
You should try the First Aid beauty skin tint for the no makeup makeup!
what was the concealer brush she used when she was buffing her shape tape concealer?
THE BEST FOUNDATION FOR oily skin hands down ♡♡♡
Love the background!! i have just tested these products too and mostly loved them all! :D
giiiirl that set up in the back got me feelin some type of way i love it
What do you use on your hair? Where are all your baby hairs? Please share your tricks......😊
I loved this look!!! You look gorgeous!
I remember back in the day u ALWAYS did a nose contour...why don't u do it any more?
Her frustration when the lash box didn't focus... I feel you Katy !!! \nhaha \nLove this look!!!!
I love the moment when you are trying to decide whether you like the matte highlight stick! Hmmm hmmmm hmmmm lol
Your background gives me Bangerz vibes, I love it!
I wish you would start video bare faced , I like to be surprised with the look 😂😘 .. loving the Katy neon light 😊
I grabbed a sample of it because I'm not really huge on matte foundations and it looked really nice on the skin but after wearing it a week straight it was just ehhh for me. I feel the same way about my Dior forever foundation. If it ain't dewy I don't want it 🙅🏽 it's not bad, but it's not my fav. 🤷🏽‍♀️
THAT NAME IN THE BACK THO IM DYING
No Makeup Makeup: Extended Cut\n\nMaybe the it Cosmetics cc cream? I use that a lot. Nice for no makeup days.
@KATY

Blinking Beaute is based out of the Bay Area!
Love it! Joone needs to mic up for these videos, I live for his one liners,
It’s so funny hearing your husband in the background 😂
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Your makeup looks so good I really really love the eye look

this background is bomb🔥👀
ONCE I GOT IT WET IT GOT SO BIG LMAAOOO LOVE IT
I think the Foundation looks very very nice on you..😍😍😍😎😎😎😎
Love the Katy sign back there. Not a Huda fan since she does not promote women of color
Love this video!! What I like to do with the matchsticks is use my regular concealer that matches my skin and then I use the concealer stick to highlight a little and it works nicely on my skin. Maybe that could help?
THE KATY SIGN FROM THE UD COACHELLA HOUSE THOO! IF YOU REMEMBER THAT VLOG YOURE PROBABLY JUST AS OBSESSED WITH KATY AND DESI AS I AM 😂
What morphe brush do you use to buff out the concealer under the eye?
So if this is Katy putting hot new sh*t on her face, is this Katy getting sh*t faced? 🤔
Not even 5 minutes in but I love joons commentary
what *is* the standard primer you use?
This background is perfect!! 🦄
You should try Estée Lauder double wear nude water whatever for your no makeup but makeup look!!
Video title for no makeup vid: SOME MAKEUP MAKEUP

My goodness she looked soooo beautiful with that black dress on . I literally said WOW!  😍🖤
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE, she is hilarious like she's not even trying to be funny! lol
That faux leather jacket looked so good on you!
Walmart has clothes online and some stuff looks fishy and out of place, yet looks decent? PLEASE DO WALMART THAT WOULD BE SO INTERESTING
i love your reviews!!
Should I have a bum fanny? 😂😂😂😂
I love watching your videos always making me laugh
😚Hi Patricia new subbie here nice to meet you. Have you reviewed Amiclubwear or Fashion Effects? I would love to hear your opinion. You make your reviews so much fun to watch😂
Patricia can you please do a review on a website called PoshShop 🙏🏻🙏🏻
I love those black trousers!!!
Fantastic video as usual! Please say you filmed that look too!!
Dood I like her hair. Can you do a hair tutorial?
how do you get your skin so smooth
I rarely comment on videos, but I LOVE that you try your things on to show us the quality and look. Would you mind doing eShakti, and put in your custom measurements so we can see how good they are with the custom work?
I like your hair , how did you do it ?
girl you look cute this was a fun video thanks
Hey Patricia I really love your channel😍. Could you please do a YesStyle review
Romwe and Shein are interlaced, I think they're the same company.
How can you be so rude!? I love that!! I'm gonna say that from now on 😂
LOVED this video! Keep them coming! :)
thank you for this!
You can see the nipple at 12:54😂
Will you be doing a video on the short wet wig hairstyle? @PatriciaBright
I sometime like watching Patricia videos just for her beautiful accent/voice
am i the only one who thinks she looks like Taraji p. Henson??
i spent like 400 bucks on there too
Black Deep V-Neck wrap dress: Sold out sorry!\n\nThey have this exact same dress on Shein for $34 and it's not sold out. Can't be a coincidence.
You are a ray of sunshine!! Love the new hair too 💓
When you said jumper I thought you actually meant jumper not sweater
I broke my wrist holding this but that's a good thing...lol too much
With how many of these videos she does, she must have so much clothes, like I just wanna see her closet 😂😂😂
LOL, I watch just because I know it will be entertaining.
Get some boob tape and all your nipple to the wind problems will be solved. That shit is great. I use it for comic cons and it holds the fabric well.
Love your channel - you are hilarious!  Subscribed!
I shout when I'm excited too 😂😂😂
I live in the u.s. my packages came in 6 days and everything was as expected
Where's that black top from you're wearing with one sleeve so cute!?

When I say I am LIVING for Patricia's haul review videos. The commentary has me in tears. Literal tears of laughter

I'm the Tennesee Wonder Child.
Oh Olan, although your glorious stories are obviously at least slightly fabricated, I still enjoy them as if they were 100% genuine, and I truly appreciate your enthusiasm and dedication to storytelling.
This is the best story yet! I've missed you :(
MISSED THESE STORIES SO MUCH
I. LOVE. YOU!!! Your videos make me laugh my brains out. The upward motion when you said hang up got me every time and I literally died 19 times watching this video. I love you so much!!
I really liked this one
THIS IS THE BEST STORY EVER
I have cousins named Donovin and Trey 😂😂😂..
Unless you spell it like Tray
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I freaking 'home alone'd the guy
become trey!!
LUNCH
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
THAT ENDING PLOT TWIST WOAH
I almost fell off my chair 😂😂😂😂
When you right your name, do people think it’s dan rodgers because of the “o” and the “l” next to each other?
“And he never called back. I don’t know why. I was so friendly.” 😂😂😂
I freakin home alone the guy! Favorite quote
One of the youtubers that will sail off the edge of the world but his channel will never die. CONTENT.
Your fingers are no longer naked!!
Wether or not his stories are true they are always funny 😂😂
Similar thing happened to my sister. One day people just kept calling her and wishing her a happy birthday, when it wasn't her birthday. Someone even called her from jail to wish her a happy birthday.. One of them left a voice message singing happy birthday, in the style of Marilynn Monroe singing to the president.
Romania calls me all the time! I'm in a mid western state in the United States
You're my friend Drew Harrison's boss now! #sodaparlorvibes
I love you so much, Olan. Best YouTuber, hands down. 😊❤️ And this story is so relatable. Before I switched numbers, I got calls from hotels, insurance companies, debt collectors, scam galore, and the worst was the constant calls for some Robin Walker chick. She also owed a lot of money 😂
When I got my first phone, I kept on and kept on getting messages from people in pretty much every state asking if Paul could confirm various transactions or statements, or, a bit later, very concerned messages asking if he had gotten back from his trip yet. I was like: “Wow... I think Paul probably got fed up with his mundane, money-counting life and went on vacation to never come back. Good for you, Paul. Go see the world.”
I watched this at 10:00pm and I had to plug my nose I was laughing so hard and tears we're welling up in my eyes..  HALLARIOUS 😂 😂
I freakin' Home Aloned the guy! I'M DEAD.....
This is totally a memphis thing. I've had my 901 number for about 10 years and i get sooo many wrong number calls
Low key an ad for PayPal
These make my day. X3
I remember one time I got called by a random number and I kept telling her she had the wrong number then she said no, I got the right number I kept insisting that she didn't dial the right number, then she told me my number and asked me if that was MY number, so I freaked out, hung up, and blocked her, for some reason I kept getting calls from a bunch of people I didn't know
Oh my freakin god, Olan!!! I haven't laughed that hard in a while. This story was so hilarious that I actually started crying from the laughter. I just completely lost it at the part when you put the phone up to the TV while watching Jurassic Park. You're awesome and I always love your stories. Please don't stop telling them.
* Wheeze *
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
....I will kill you. Why tho?
XD
I LOVE YOU
This one was of my favorites...thank you so much, Olan. You never cease to make me sooo happy
This is better then my game of phones story lol
Tennessee Wonderchild, I knew you existed. TAKE THAT, AA
omg i had a wrong phone call, and this dude kept calling me. so im like no im not trayvon oyu have the wrong number sir, he says nah bruh u got the wrong phone now put trayvon on i blocked his number after that lol wrong phone like wtf
I'M THE TENNESSEE WONDER CHILD!! omg. I'm dead. So fraking funny. I love this
And then Marcus actually watches this video... xD
funniest since ghost in the stalls lol
This is amazing
I'M DEAD also you match your bed BUT I LOVE YOUR STORY
After allllll these years, his videos have stayed the same. He's never changed. Amazing YouTuber. Amazing man.
This was AMAZING You're going to be the best Dad and Grandad EVER! I always loved to hear my grandad's story's and you remind me of (a much younger version of) him :D Good luck on Final Space sir!
I started silent laughing as soon as he unmute the TV. Couldn’t breathe for a second. I’m okay now...Incase anyone was wondering 😂😭
Promise me one thing hit the text books. Haha.
I'm so happy your back
It's been so long since we've seen you! This was the first time I've laughed in over four months.
holy mother of a boiling spoonful of salt these stories are the epitome of hilarity.
This video was sponsored by PayPal
Ahhh, missed yo face O! The story was a bit of a stretch for me :/...just wasn't feeling it personally, but it's good to see/hear from you...It's been a while, yeah...it's a been while. #GITS
Oh my god this is brilliant!!!! XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD
Some random person in jail called my cell phone TWICE! Thank god I was busy and didn't answer, the automated system left me voice mails. 😲
You never cease to me make me laugh til my tummy hurts. You truly crack me up! Thank you, Olan, for sharing  your crazy life experiences with us. :)
I just want you to know... you're my hero. My girlfriend very strongly believes that you are my spirit animal. Just thought you should know.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BLOCK HIM!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
Jack Black? You look so young!
It’s about time you came out with a new story Bro!!!
I NEEDED A STORY SO BADLY TODAY. I've got an awful cold and an exam next week and crap tons of homework and I just really needed something to take my mind off it all and smile about. Thanks so much Olan!!
Straight up, my name is Donovan and I kept hearing you say my name and I sorta got super stoked. He knows me omg how do I social
did you purposely match your shirt to your bed?
How is it that despite going months between telling stories, it doesn't feel like it's been that long? There must be some sort of strange temporal distortion going on here. Are Starscream and TARDIS messing with the timeline?
You don't mess with the Tennessee Wonder Child and if you do, your name is probably Marcus
OlanRogers you are the funniest person I have ever heard. Hey and good job with the songs
I'm more glad that this man was born
I'm so glad your back! I've missed story time!!!!
It's been too dang long
I have wanted someone to call me over and over again for this very reason.
Incredible story, once again, Olan.  Thanks for the laughs
This was fantastic! It might surpass Ghost in the Stalls in my opinion but they're both so hilarious it's hard to say!
For someone's name who is Donevin myself, its very rare to hear my name anywhere. Also I had a similar experience, some guy maybe around his 50's called me on my cellular device, and told me Now litsen here mother f****, you better be ready because we're about to roll up on your block. I was just appalled because someone was being threatened that wasnt me. The only response that came out in my confusion was ok. Then he proceeds to say Do you know who this is!!! Im over here just thinking I sure hope not. So I decide to yell back at him  Do you know who this is!! And he says no, who is this? Then I respond in a very calm like matter, Not who you think this is. The only thing that comes out of his mouth is .....oh. Then I tell him yeah wrong number man and he hung up. Im not sure who this man was or whose street he was going to roll down but I sure hope its on a decline hill so he may roll into the sunset forever embarrassed by his wrong number phone call.
I. Have. Been. Waiting. So. Long. For. This. YES
Bless
Dude I love you😂😂
OMG Love it! Amazing storyteller sir! Bravo
When Olan starts laughing so hard that he starts choking... that gets me more than the story does every time 😂😂😂
W E R E B E A R S
When you live in Tennessee :') I'm shOOk
I love your story telling, you are God, been following a while so glad you're back..so close to 1M subs now.
DED
Did not see that ending coming!!!!!!!
THE KING IS BACK !
6:05 why tho? IM CRYING
that was BEAUTIFUL
haha
IS THIS TRUE?!? 😂😂😂😂😂
KING OF STORIES
V clutch with the matching shirt and bedding.
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
We missed you Olan!
As clear as Crystal Pepsi
I freaking love you, sir
i missed you!!
MARCUS!!!!!!!
i am stephanie. your shirt matches your bedsheets
What's done is done💔\n\nGonna miss you guys so much!
Love how limbo panto-esque the name is as well, harkening back to the eras of she purred while I grrrd and Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants
Your split has broken my heart. However this is a great track to drop before the end.
The many songs wildbeasts have made I will always cherish and remember, good luck with your journeys, just wanted to say thank you for your music moving me out of mental health problems when I listened to wanderlust it made me think about my life and it gave me strength, thank you
Brilliant song :(
Oh god this is sad. The Feb gig is gonna be tough
Wild Beasts was brilliant.  Hope to hear of new musical project for all of you.
Seeing this pop in my notifications feels like salt in the wound! Still hard to believe they broke up. The crying Boy King illustration is only fitting! :^(\n\nRegardless of it all, I will always love you guys!!!
Oh... I love.

It sad that we had to wait until you broke up just to listen to another master piece like this one. I'll miss you guys :'(
Today I leasing radio and who's say - it's end of wild bests, this is true?
Glad I was able to see you guys in Baltimore all those years ago! Videos are still on my page. Always remember! Thank you guys for the many great years of music. You were a big part of a good chunk of my life. My 3 year old daughter even knows your music :) best of luck!
Still can’t believe you guys are splitting up, you’re the best band in the UK. I can’t believe you’d end as you guys definitely had so much more to give. Thanks for all your music. X
I'M SO SAD AND YET SO HAPPY OH GOD WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SPLIT
No, Did they split up? But they have to be in my movie, they just don't know it yet...
I still can't get over knowing the next time I see you boys perform will be the last. Thank you for every song you shared with us.
Immaculate final single.
Nice!
<3 :'(
So Good
It sounds greaaat!
Amazin'
Incredible song as always 😍❤
Farewell guys, gonna miss you
We couldn't go with them, dreamliner
They broke up that's fd up
Lit Boizzz.
Since I've read that they won't be playing together anymore I've been coming to term with the fact that I'll never listen to them live. And seeing this in my subscription box is like a last goodbye. Thank you for being my favorite band since Limbo Panto came out. Enjoined following you on you musical journey. Such an innovative and mature band. It's been a wild ride.
At least bring The Farewell Tour to Mexico, let us enjoy your live music one last time.
They're back!!!!!
Geniales los padres
A Messi le toco bailar con el Maffeo
Que voz tan rica
el marcaje en individiual es una putada para el atacante y el defensor, pero quien haya jugado a futbol sabe que es una opción más. Igual si no le hubieran marcado así messi les mete 2 o 3 goles. Al final lo que cuentan son los 3 puntos, y no si juego como me gusta o no
QUEDATE CON QUIEN TE CUIDE COMO MAFFEO A MESSI 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
bien por Mafeo, así se marca limpiamente y no a patadas
Crack Maffeo porque nunca quiso párarlo apunta de patada \nEn cambio Pepe es mas feo que las ganas de cagar y rajero 😂😂
Messi no tiene a Deulofeu y entonces le traen a uno mafeo
Jugar así es Maffeo.
Los marcajes individuales es una putada, no le dejas disfrutar al chaval, muy mal Machís
Los fans de Cristianos son homosexuales reprimidos, lo admiran mas por su altura, su bronceado, sus musculos y por que es guapo.
pues ni yo me le despegaría un segundo
por qe me encanta su voz?❤
Gran marcatge Maffeo
What does this video mean in English??
Messi to man city soon
Me parecio excelente lo de Maffeo,se preparo toda la semana para marcar a Messi y lo logro..ademas no pego una patada,lo anuló hasta donde pudo je.
por fin VIDEO DEL BARÇA POR FIN
Maffeo Respect!
jaja sus papas son geniales xD
Y le funcionó por que Messi no marcó aunque igual el Girona perdió jejeje
jajajaa
d
¡Mario sube el camino!
Pesiiiii!
Maffeo putoamo :v
Mario sube el camino
Hermoso video.
Maffeo desde colombia te apoyo.. fuerza campeon....
Ojaa viniera al barsa
Mario sube el camino
Jajajajaja
Buen Messi 😂👑👏👏👏
Ahhhaahhahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahaha
substitle bitches
Zabaleta II
Zorba el griego
Los reportajes parecen novelas jaja
Maffeo tienen que comprarlo
Tú eres mi amigo fiel jajajajajajaja
1:11 catacrock .
Jajajaj
City watch = life
Messi, Messi, Messi
Tu voz me da sueño ;v
ni así pudieron ganar
Cuál era el chiste? Evitar que el Barcelona, te golee o que Messi no marcara gol? Porque si es la segunda sabiendo que puede pasar la primera, es un asco.
Unos genios los padres. Esa señora tiene mis respetos!
Pues, si.  Era Messi quien seguía a Pablo a todo lado.\nY hasta quería su camiseta.\nBravo Pablo. Si fuera tu Abuelo estaría orgulloso de tu buen trabajo.
eso es ser profesional...
narración mas fea esta. este video no me gusto por eso
Ahora resulta que hay que darle explicaciones a un rival de que seras su marca personal, de verguenza. No me imagino a Maldini, Cannavaro, Ferdinand, Puyol o defensas de antaño como Oscar Ruggeri decirle al rival disculpame por marcarte
Yo creo que se combinaron muchas cosas buenas porque así como Maffeo nunca le llegó con mala intencion,Messi a su vez tampoco quiso hacerlo,y hay que ver que Messi con su habilidad lo habría podido hacer,Fair Play le llaman por ahí 😊😀
Estaba cagado del susto ese defensa. Demasiada responsabilidad si anotaba Messi. Hizo un buen trabajo!
A ronaldo los tecnicos no le ponen marcas asi por que nole ponen atencion
Genial que hagan vídeos así (Y)
Pobres los dos muchachos.  Maffeo por ratos casi llora tratando de enterder la magnitud de querer parar al mejor jugador del mundo mision casi imposible.   Muchas veces la profesion te lleva a cumplir roles realmente en contra de tus creencias.  Pero asi es la vida.  Ellos dos cumplieron y el Barcelona casi como siempre gano!
A ronaldo no hace falta ni qu lo marque el mas paquete del equipo, total los goles los falla solo
Que presión para maffeo, hay que destacar eso, te ordenan marcar los 90 minutos al mejor del mundo y sabes que en cualquier momento se te puede escapar.
Despues del partido me parece gracioso hubiese estado super gracioso que lo invitace a cenar con la familia
messi no le hizo gol al poderoso Girona??? que raro
Las dos mejores actitudes para una situación tan ingrata y poco vistosa. \nDos caballeros. Chapeau
corre con una cara de la concha de su madre ya se me fue este un padre nuestro y a ver si ocurre un milagro !
Quien es ma feo de los dos? Lo pilláis?\n😂😂
resultado  final de esta estrategia obsoleta? 0-3
Para jugar así que no juegue, desde el primer minuto pidiéndole perdón a messi menudo marica me daría vergüenza tener un jugador así
Lo triste cuando los demás jugadores no tienes su lugar ganado es que los traen en modo robots/títeres & eso me enfada. Dejen a los futbolistas jugar como ellos se sientan cómodos. Dejen el fútbol ser un deporte, olviden el dinero por un rato.
Me gustaría ver a PABLO MAFFEO en el Barcelona... Mucho mas que a la MITAD de la plantilla actual del Barcelona. \nese MUCHACHO SI TIENE TALENTO, logreo PARAR EL 50% DEL PODER DE MESSI, y eso ya es decir MUCHO!\nTiene Buen marcaje, el chico. Y buena aptitud. Para mi un JUGADORAZO!
Estar a 7 puntos es una mierda
Maffeo marca a Cristiano y este le responde: Y quien eres tu? Yo soy el mejor, Xavi juega en Qatar...
Que estrategia mas mala del entrenador, en vez se marcar a un solo jugador, deberian marcara los que estan sueltos y no solo a uno, se que messi es el mejor y es el que mas peligro da pero bueno...
Jajajajjaj quizas no se vea bien el marcaje personal, pero logro de alguna manera evitar que messi tuviera un mejor partido xd. Me parecio chistoso, no se porque tantas quejas. Al fin y al cabo es futbol y esta para disfrutar xd
Reyna-maradona la original!!! Una copia exacta la de maffeo-messi y si q lo desaparecio!! eso aremos el 5 de octubre pero muchos anos atras mi viejo me cuenta q alguien se la izo al gran perico leon de ahi la copia un venezolano a maradona y de ahi viene la de reyna-maradona!! Increible cambio y fuera!!!
ajajajajajajajajajajaja que cosa mas agradable
Como Reyna a Maradona... Maffeo a Messi... y dicen que el marcaje personal no funciona...
Que hermoso es el futbol. Que conste que soy del Madrid
Jajaja que bueno rollo ese
La verdad .  Messi y ese jugador mis respeto.. Jaajajajja lo disfrutaron..
El no es el más bonito, el es el Ma' feo
Hay que ser retrasao para hacer un marcaje individual y hacerte colega de tu marcaje cuando lo que tienes que hacer es intimidarlo dentro del campo, en fin...
Qué buena clase tienen los que arman éste programa. Excelente. Siempre generan buen humor en quienes lo vemos. Gracias.
Maffeo estaba hasta avergonzado, además de estar casi todo el partido a su lado, anulándolo, llega Portu y se queja, amos no me jodas! Y muy bien por Messi, por entenderlo y ser agradable.
0:40 Messi Que hago para sacarme a este de encima jajaja Grande Messi, Buen Partido de Maffeo cumplió con lo que le pidieron!
Buenísimos los videos, desde Argentina
I don't understand spanish, somebody to translate to me please ? :'c
La voz de la chica me la puso como brazo de albañil 👀💪
bueno le dio resultado 😯 Messi no hizo goles!
A Cristiano lo marcan asi porque Messi es mejor 😎😎😎😎
Can some one translate in English what the players are saying?
I DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH
Please translate it :'(
DESCUBRE INFIDELIDAD Y REACCIONA VIOLENTAMENTE \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_UNMTjoFvn0
Tas loco , solo en Europa se ve eso. Acá en Sudamérica sabes como lo matan a patadas todo el partido?! Jaja y encima le tiran un :  “ levántate cagón , que ni te toque...” por eso le cuesta tanto acá, porque no lo miran , acá lo marcan en serio.
Por eso en sudamerica no triunfa;alla le piden disculpas por marcarlo, le muestran un respeto cercano al temor. Aca lo marcan de verdad y le dan leña. Es un crack Lio de todas formas
Marcaje personal es el futbol de antes y es efectivo.
mmm con esa voz y si esta exitada mamu te rompo toda
Ha anulado a Messi, lo resto es conversa. Grande Maffeo
Soy yo el entrenador y se va a la grada todo el año,  le ha faltado pedirle de rodillas lo siento...lamentable
Maffeo fue como si fuera una seleccion de sudamerixa, menudo pecho frio ese frionel xd
QUÉ VOZ MAS FEA...

Jaclyn can you do a lip swatch and review video on those L'Oreal matte liquid lipsticks? I know there are some out there but I've found your videos are true to the colors more than others and I love to hear your opinion because I trust it! Thanks for getting back to videos your the best!!!
ps: can you please list the products doll thanks
Please please please bring back the fall favorites tag video!! That was one of my favs!!
This video was so annoying.  Horrible review of products.  You need some lessons girl cause you can't review.  Very unprofessional you obviously don't not know what your doing.  You cannot place one brand if lip color in top if another.  I could go on and on, but I won't.  This is one of the worst review videos I've ever seen.
Trying to give you tips without sounding rude! I just feel like your intros should be more upbeat and happy. you criticizing yourself and pointing out what's right up in your teeth isn't exactly making me want to watch the rest of your video lol. I love your videos but i wish your positive side came out more in the intros! Don't overthink it
No, its not you! it didn't hurt me but it has a better strong smell that makes my eye water.\nI've used it 3 times just to make sure it wasn't a one day thing and no. It does stings! NOT JUST YOU!
JACLYN I JUST GOT CHAMPAGNE POP!!!! IM SO HAPPY
I have the same exact reaction to the maybelline concealers! My skin immediately starts to sting when I apply it
Maybelline Concealers ALWAYS burn my under eyes depending on the amount I apply. Drugstore concealers just have not worked for me, other than LA Girl!
I am not going anywhere near that concealer. Both you and Michael Finch have had the same reaction. I kinda don't feel like burning my eyes
Michael Finch had the same problem with this concealer, is it safe? Cause I dont think this is ok. A concealer is not supposed to do that.
Oh my gosh, I have seen so many people have the same reaction to that concealer!!!!!!
I tried that concealer tooo.. didn't sting my skin but it made my eyes tingle and water.. and iriscel in YouTube had the same issue.. it gave my mom a headache when she tried it... soooo they need to get it together lol
Did she get fillers in her face ????
Taylor (thataylaa) also had the same reaction with the concealer
GIRLLLL WHEN IS THAT BRIDAL MAKEUP TUTORIAL COMING OUT? I'm dying to see it and getting married next summer!!! Love you!!
Your baaaaaack!!! THE Jaclyn Hill we know and love! No more guilt trips girl,life's too short.look forward to a makeup/skincare haul? Review tutorial,Victoria Beckham+estee Lauder?.love youuuuu.xx
old Jaclyn is definitely back.... missed u !! ❤️❤️❤️
15:51 me in the morning with a full face on from the night before.
Thank you for making videos using your palette. I am make-up illiterate and I am loving your palette and am learning so much! I feel like I am creating art when I use it.
My can reacted the same way to that concealer not only that I woke up the next morning with a swollen eye and burned skin it took one week for the swollen eye to go down
you're not the only one who felt the stinging sensation from that exact concealer
I bought the Loreal concealer because I heard it was a comparable dupe to the Nars creamy concealer but it stings so bad when I put it on my skin! Ouch! I've even tried different shades thinking it was a fluke thing but nope! Sticking with Nars from now on.
Casey Holmes tried that concealer and it burned her too !
Looking at the Loreal lip site, the Shake Down doesn't look red at all. Looks like the first color you put on. What was the Deep Blood RED color you had on at the end?? It's AMAZING!!!
I had the same issue with the L'Oréal concealer. Love the look. Especially the green.
queen
I just ordered your pallet I'm sooooooo pumped !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where is the products used? 🙁\nHappy having you back on YouTube again :)
YES GIRL!!! I LOVE that movie!!!
The Infallible Pro glow concealer burned my eyes too! Glad it's not just me.
You are so beautiful Jaclyn.
Jaclyn which morphe palette is this please?  When i search jaclyn hill morphe palette this one with these colors doesn't show up :(  i really want to purchase it.  Thanks love
Finally got a chance to order the palette and I'm suppppppper excited!!!!  Cannot wait to try the beautiful shades!!!! Congrats on your success!! So glad to see u back!!  Oh and ur eyes are gorgeous in this video! 👀
may be the pacific ingredient is burning your under eye
Casey Holmes had the same reaction to the concealer!
I wish you would've listed the products below in the description box especially becuz it's such a long video. I like to just have the videos stream on my tv as I do other things especially when they're such long videos and kept having to rewind for everything... So please list your products below !! ☺☺
I love the colors on the palette and I just ordered mine today!!! And I love the sweater that you have on in this video!!!!!
Recreating this look made me feel so pretty and I actually teared up. Shoutout to confidence and inner beauty <3
The burning reaction happened to another youtuber too! she had the same problem with the L’Oréal concealer! So when you said you were gonna use them I was sitting here wondering, is it gonna sting her too? And then you said it did and I wasn’t surprised, something’s up with it! The link to her video is here: https://youtu.be/pKN7fyXaZOw and it happens at 3:02
I've read that the L'Oréal concealer has made people's eye burn , and it has made their skin feel as if it was burning as well.
I created such a similar look  on my channel using your palette <3!!!
Bitch hey why would I subscribe you never fucking upload. Suck my dick
Jaclyn that's horrible that L'Oréal product burnt you! I wouldn't trust that company they test on animals, mainly dogs & bunnies. So terrible. You have a huge heart & I love youuuu. Since the start 💕 persevere
Please please do an updated skincare!!!!!
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Honest to god I've had such a shitty day and you just made me laugh so much. You're awesome 😌
it burned casey holmes eyes too she hated it
+Jaclyn Hill I've been watching you for a year or so now this is probably one of the BEST looks I've seen yet! 💜💜💜 IT!!!! She's back bitches! Lol! You go girl!
That concealer burns my eyes and skin too! I thought I was being dramatic about it.
Girl you know the mud slingers will always be lurking around, best not to acknowledge them, AT ALL! \nJust another form of bullying. love the look, wish I were brave enough. lol
I had the same burning reaction in my under eye area with my Maybelline fit me concealer 😭 it was super weird because I have used it for years and my newest one just burned my skin like crazy 😳 I wonder if they changed the formula recently 😲
Also,  what brush are you using for the crease/outer corner... same brush for all colors? I can never figure out how to go about that.
I've seen that concealer burn other people's eyes here on YouTube as well. Yikes! 😮
Michael finch used that concealer as well and it burned too!!!!!!!
Anybody know what brush she using when applying the color Central Park in the outer corner?
I bet the animals that concealer was tested on felt the same way :(
When the video started, and I didn't see Jaclyn's claws coming through, I was a tad concerned 😂😂
I never bought that concealer again and I dont have super sensitive skin
I love it 😍! Girl you 🎸 💃🏻
About time Jacklyn I miss you so much your my best makeup artist in the world
Jaclyn can you please do a tutorial on your ring leader costume from last year??? Would love to see how you created that. 😘
Girl every time I see you those lips are bigger.  😘
I think it would be so cool if you did a get ready with me with Hilary Duff. Kinda like what you did with Kim Kardashian. Granted I know makeup isn't as much of a focus for Hilary as it is for Kim, I think you are both flawless and it would be amazing!
Totally in a non creeper way, but I had a dream last night that we were hanging out at your new house and watching movies....So random! Hahaha. Maybe my subconscious just wants us to be friends since we live so close...You never know what you'll get with pregnancy dreams! <3P.S. beautiful look as usual!
I make my own setting powder and it's bomb! Pukey is my favorite natural work color to use. I'm glad that the L'Oréal has a good brow pencil cuz nyxs brow pencil suuucckkkksss
That burning thing happened to me with a nxy concealer!! I had to get rid of it!! 😒
Absolutely love this look and I appreciate how real you were about the drug store products. Even though I love your non drugstore looks, cause I can’t really use much when it comes to drugstore.
hope she postes another video soon I really love her
6:41 SKIN FLAWLESS. legit makes me want to run to the store right now lolll 😍
Try Beachrose by Pixi for a nice mauve blush 😍😍 love this look
Omfg stop hating on her for every little thing, she can do what she wants and if you don't like it then DONT WATCH
I haven't checked the ingredients on the Pro Glow concealer but I do know I had to stop using the Pro Glow foundation because it had too much alcohol in it and it was really irritating my sensitive skin. But it could also be the amount of fragrance, which is a really common irritant. Maybe a combination.
The first time I actually used that concealer after watching this tutorial it actually left blisters underneath my eyes where I had it and burnt soo bad. I have heard every Maybelline concealer actually burns your skin for some reason
Can you do a new video for best skin product evere fron  high and affordable price? Could be wooooow thanks always best
Not weird at all, that pro-glow had my eye red, burning, and tearing BAD. It was TERRIBLE. (But the pro-glow foundation is so amazing, i NEVER go through foundation bottles BUT that foundation doeeeeee 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼)
What makeup sponge is that?
Maybe you're allergic to concealer
yasss queen!
Have you watched Jen luks review lol
7:31 😂😂
0:07 // when your talking shit about someone to your friend
Can we get an updated house tour! I try to be nosey on snap but I would like to see the entire house(especially your closet) so I can hashtag GOALS all in the comments haha
I watched a review on another beauty youtuber and when she applied the same pro glow concealer she complained of it stinging just the same.....she also noted the pungent odor to it as well. I don't think it's you, it's the product.
It burned my eyes too and Casey Holmes
Smlx0 had the same reaction to the L’Oréal concealer when she did a fall drugstore tutorial. It burned her eyes and made them water really bad.
Does anyone know what foundation she's using? I know she said it, but i didn't catch it.
you blended that foundation to filth and it was for some reason soothing
I used that concealer for a couple of days and it didn’t really burn or I just didn’t notice it. When I watched this video & did my makeup this morning I felt the sent burn. Soooo weird
I love your videos! I recently got my Jaclyn hill eye shadow platte and I'm in love😍! Love seeing you using ur platte doing different looks.  Please do more 😘.
I've had concealer sting some times. For me I think it only happens if I exfoliate too much. Bc the next time I use it I'm fine. It happens with some gel moisturizer as well. I will get done washing my face, put moisturizer on and it burns. Then the next day nothing.
Can you list the products please?
You are the 3rd youtuber I've watch that had problems with the Loreal concealer burning their skin and eyes. What are the putting in there that is making it burn?? So scary.
I bought your palette yesterday as it was released in the U.K yesterday morning. You probably already know, but there were so many people trying to get their hands on your palette that the entire site just crashed and EVERYONE was going crazy because they couldn't get it for the longest time. But yeah, my point is that absolutely EVERYONE wanted your palette so badly... that's an achievement. I'm super excited to receive mine today!
How many more times are we going to hear the rant during the foundation portion....🤔😅
Please check out Jenluvsreviews video she made about this video. I really like her, but I think the video was problematic and not fair to Jaclyn. I don't think it was her place to tell her how to run her channel
Love ❤️
The loreal concealer burned my skin/eyes too!
🐍
Please do a video on SKINCARE FAVORITES!!!!
I've never heard of this, but thanks for the awareness!
I don't understand... if there is too much sugar in the blood, doesn't that make you pass out the same as having too little?
When I was 13 I almost died from this. I was in a coma and the doctor apparently CRIED when he was talking to my parents because he said he didn't think I was going to make it, they should say their goodbyes. I'm 35 now and I have diabetic retinopathy,  and neuropathy. \n\nIt is a really easy trap to fall into when you realize you can lose a lot of weight very fast and very easily. You can eat anything and lose weight. You don't think about the comications when you are young. You think it only happens after you've had diabetes for decades. I am so lucky I am alive and that my comications aren't worse. I know bad stuff is coming for me down the road because of my diabetes, so I try my very best to keep my blood sugar where it needs to be. It really is exhausting, and like one woman said in the video, you never get a day off. What a horrible, miserable, disease.
I have T1Diabetes and I have heard of people doing this, but I didn't know it actually had a name. It will easily kill you and completely wreck all of your organs, especially your kidneys and eyes. The sad thing is that people can usually fully physically recover from other eating disorders, but this you can't at all. I didn't really realize this was an actual thing, but I guess it makes sense. So sad. My heart goes out to anyone suffering from an eating disorder.
18:31 the look on that poor moms face is just crushing :( .
Gemma is so beautiful, such a shame really...
Oh BoY, I KnOw I WaNt tO gEt ThIs ShIt
this was really interesting to watch, what an eye opening documentary and the 3rd girl seemed so sweet, so glad she's come so far from where she was before.
I have three sisters, one one of them who's suffered from eating disorders, and the other two both have type 1 diabetes, I didn't even know about this until I clicked on this video.
I can't wait to try this.
The Muslim girl and her family were sweethearts, hope they are all well.
OMIGOD I HAVE TYPE 1 DIABETES NO IM SCARED
I adore channels like this,  that educate about relatively unknown topics.
My brother has type 1. He struggles with it everyday and I had no idea this was a thing, and this message needs to be spread.
Her dad is great
A really good documentary, and really informative. I'd never heard of this before now.
I haven't watched the documentary yet so maybe I'm commenting prematurely. However, I don't think that this eating disorder should only be specific to diabetes. I have to take steroids for several autoimmune conditions and they make me gain weight. On several occasions I've stopped taking my medication to lose weight, to the point where I get very ill. This isn't to diminish those who have this but I think the eating disorder should be a bit more broad to include all conditions where people stop taking life-saving medicine for the purpose of losing weight.
Oh and addicts, depending on the depth of the addiction don't admit themselves till the 3rd time when the addiction exhausts the addicts resources and health.  post contemplation
I was born with Cystic Fibrosis and later in life diagnosed with CFRD (cystic fibrosis related diabetes). When I was 14 I developed Diabulimia. It's one fucking hell of a mental illness, It destroyed not only my life but my whole families as well. I was admitted into an eating disorder ward in 2014 & quickly realized that the whole program was only geared towards people who restricted calories, not medication in order to lose weight. I wish there was more awareness back then so I could have got the support and help I felt I needed to get better. I had to take it upon myself to get better which is why documentaries like these are extremely important to help educate.\nFor all those struggling with this you are not alone, there IS hope. Diabulimia is real and it's a living hell but with more awareness will come more understanding and help.   Stay Strong♡
Nabeelah is living like me in the sense that in my culture mental illness is something to be ashamed of. No one wants to listen but everyone is willing to shame you for it. For years I tried to get help from my family, I was at a point where I tried to commit suicide 3 times. Yet, they refused me any help because it's an embarrassment to have a crazy daughter and people would talk about what terrible parents they were. On top of that my parents are also catholic and they believe everything can be heal through prayer. Prayer helps but the voices in my head have never left. I'm 26 and still struggling
When I saw her prick her finger I started screaming I hate Shots I can handle sewing needles because those don't go in your body and put fluids in your body 😭😭😭 i start crying at the doctors if I hear them say it even in code my mom will get mad because I'm being a  crybaby  😑 she just doesn't understand!
I'm so sorry.
can u make a documentary about adrenal fatigue?
It is trully heart warming to see how loving that girls parents are.. I'm in tears
I'm a type 1 diabetic and this is terrifying to me, I hope all with diabulimia get help and are hopefully able to recover.
Nabeelah's parents are just the sweetest people <3
No insulin for two weeks?!?? I throw up from ketoacidocis if I'm without it for 5-6 hours, and having ketoacidocis is worse than the flu, how can you live like that for two weeks??? It should've killed her????
the dad around 20 minutes, i'm gonna cry <3
love how they made a little ones swing from a plastic stool
The epi- pen that's not an epi pen
This got me really close. I suffer from hiperinsulinemia, which is exactly the opossite of diabetes.. and I really know the struggle, it´s an everyday fight, sometimes a fight against your own body and it turns into something really dangerous. Videos like this help so many people. Thanks BBC
Wow this was so moving I've been bulimic for 17 year I've been recovering for 9months and it's been so hard I couldn't imagine having diabetes to deal with too my heart really does go out to these people,
Wow, the support (or lack of) for this really is shit :/ I hope it'll improve soon.
I had never anything thought about this, as a psychology major and big sister to a type one diabetic. Thank you for bringing this to light. I definitely want to have this be one of my specializations when I get to counsel adolescents.
Never heard of this before! Thankyou for the awareness. Very informative.
I wish my dad was that calm and understanding. I don't have diabetes or eating disorder but if it was me who tell my parents I did something wrong my dad would freak out and start yelling at me and torment me for weeks about it, and maybe even bring it up again months or even years later so I'll never live it down.
get a nurse to supervise injections while service also providing cbt for anorexia...  how is that too complex HELP THEM
What about giving them pumps instead of having to inject themselves
she is drug addict too, smoking weed all of the video.
Thanks for raising awareness. Very dangerous and sad to hear about
i feel like a giant hole has been filled in my chest after watching this. i was in this exact mindset for so long and i continue to struggle with it every day. all of the treatment i received, everyone said i was crazy and killing myself. no one understood, and although i knew i wasn’t the only one out there with an eating disorder along with type 1 diabetes, i didn’t know that it was an actual topic and a real condition. so so reassuring. thank you
24/9/2017 a 16 yr old girl in my school passed away due to diabetes when she was actually really skinny...i think this is the illness she had...\n\n\n\nbut before she died, she vomitted blood and bleed from her nose...
I like meat, fruit, I don’t like veggies but I can eat it and I despise fish ... a.m. I okay
jesus I had no idea... people need to know about this
I was diagnosed with type 2 at a young age and by the time I was 18 I saw the higher my sugar levels were, the more weight I lost. I eventually got down to the weight I wanted, I was finally skinny  I loved it but my sugars told a different story, I was living dangerously.
I didn't know this was a thing! Thank you for raising awareness.
Just a thought. Maybe these people shouldn't reproduce and pass on their defective genes.
I hope that everyone receives the help that they need.
I think Professional hypnotherapy would greatly help this condition.
I have suffered from it all my life, no one knows or even attempts to understand. I have eye and kidney problems now.
Finally! I've been waiting for a video like this, that spreads awareness and that make people understand. I've been struggling with my diabulimia for years and gotten help from more than one eating disorder clinic. But the thing is that nobody knows exactly how to treat my illness and it always feels like I'm the one who educates my doctors and  psychologists. \nWhen I went to a daycare for treatment I was told by the staff that I needed to go to the bathroom to take my insulin, by my self, and hide it from the others with normal eating disorders. They were afraid that I would scare the rest.. But my anxiety kicks in when I'm about to take my insulin and nobody would be there to support me or check that I would that my medication .. \nWe need to spread awareness and I think that this video needs to be shared ! With more information I hope that clinics, doctors, the psychiatry and so on, will educate och learn more about how to treat diabulimia.
When I worked at a psychiatric facility as a psychiatric technician on the children/adolescents floor, one of my most depressed patients was a girl with diabetes. She tried to kill herself by not taking care of her blood glucose level and she ended up in a coma at least once before I met her. \n\nOn another note, Nabeelah's parents seem like they really care about her a lot, her dad is so open with her and I love it.
Why do they think not taking insulin but still eating a lot will make them skinny? Throwing up or something? Insulin isn't what makes you fat, food makes you fat.
i hope she stops smoking
diabetes needs to be more aware. i’m tired of people thinking type 1 diabetes is from being fat or eating to much sugar. it’s ridiculous
I kinda eat a lot and I'm skinny, Idk if I was born skinny or not
Can you please do a video to raise awareness for misophonia? I'm 11 and I have it, it would be nice to be more understood.
The thing is insulin doesn't make you gain weight, my dad had type 1 diabetes and he injected himself with insulin when he needed to yet he was still so skinny, he was 6'1 and 8 stone.
I just wished they talked about males with eating disorders since not many people know they exist
Such beautiful lady's!!! I hope they get all the help and support 💖💖
And these are the people who get fat-shamed then blamed for their mental illnesses. Sad.
I have been a nurse for many years, and even worked on the Mental Health units and this is the first time I have heard of this.  I appreciate that you guys are spreading awareness about things like this, keep up the good work!
I dont get how she did this. As a type 1 diabetic, getting more than a 10 on the glucose-level I get headace, bad stomach, dryness in my eyes and mouth, thirsty, sick, fatigue.
Wow I could see how this could be really serious. Because when I was bulimic my blood sugar would drop, like where I would sweat, get weak, shakey etc. and I’m not diabetic.
You learn something new every day
Thank you. From the bottom of my heart thank you, for bringing light to not only eating disorders, but to the so very misunderstood plight of Type 1 diabetics. I feel a little less alone, and hope that the medical community, as well as the general population continue to gain knowledge of what we go through. It's often hard to talk to people, especially those who care about you.  This was immensely helpful. Thank you, again.
I'm a type one diabetic, and it's awful and hard, but I would never do this for weight loss. If you are doing this to yourself, please stop (or get help to try and get to recovery). Your body NEEDS the insulin. You're beautiful the way you are, don't ever think otherwise. Please take your insulin in the right amounts. Trust me, I know it's hard with all the math and needles and bruises and scars, but it's so so so important to keep your sugars stable and well. My heart is with all other type one diabetics, and I wish you all the best💖
So sad to know people can't get the care they need because the Dr's don't know how to treat it. Most people with ED don't want help because they will gain weight and that's so scary for them. It's a mental disorder that kills so many.
so happy that this video was made for people like myself to learn about this eating disorder - i had not heard about this before, wishing the best of luck to everyone who took part in this video x
the muslim family broke my heart. the mother looked like she was worried sick and the father when he said i love you always and forever, i lost it. so sad for all these people both the patients and the families. i wish this didn't exist ever. such pain and heartache for everyone.
Thank you for sharing this
Wow I never thought of this eating disorder. Very interesting and very heartbreaking as well. Eating disorders are some of the worst things that can mentally and emotionally happen to you. I've struggled with anorexia and bulimia for close to 4 years now and it's so straining. I hope all these individuals get the help they need 😘
Having an eating disorder while having ED forums to access, I learned about this quickly. Somewhat luckily, I'm not diabetic. I can only imagine what they go through. Eating disorders kill and it makes me so happy we're finally sharing knowledge on this one in particular.
I have watched it yet but if it’s got anything to do with diabetes and eating disorders then I know where it’s coming from, I had eating disorders before I was diagnosed and finally got to a weight I was somewhat happy with before I was diagnosed and because of that I was 22kg at age 12, but once I was diagnosed and started putting weight back on it was really hard and my eating disorders got worse, then with being forced to give my medication but having multiple eating disorders and not actually getting any carbs from the food I injected for I ended up in hospital multiple times and I’ve also stopped taking my insulin before in the hopes to go back to how easily I was loosing weight pre-diagnoses
im kind of ashamed to say I want to be as skinny as gemma.\ni have an eating disorder but i feel like food is the only thing i have control over, thus I won't allow myself it.
I had a friend who did this. She was also a binge drinker and the only time I saw her give herself insulin was when she was drinking. She would spend the night at my house often and in the mornings I would see her downing Oreos and cakes because her blood sugars would dip so low. She also had depression and would cry to me often that she rather die than get fat from insulin. her doctor even told her she was starting to lose her eyesight and her kidneys were in bad shape. It was very sad and hard to help her(we all tried), but she refused. She had rage issues so we are no longer friends, but I believe she's still doing this 8 years later.
Oh wow, I'd never heard of this! So glad it popped up on suggested videos to watch. I'll share it now to spread awareness
0:55 aww i wanna take care of you...
U wouldn’t notice if a morbidly obese person put on a stone so why do these fatties care bout getting fatter when they’re already so large\n\nGood video for raising awareness tho lol
I'm so glad I got to learn about this, I had no idea it existed.
I'm not rich enough for this disorder. When I have money, I get to eat.
Type 1 squad where u at!
I have type 2... and I need insulin... and I do this to stay thin. It works... but I also now have neuropathy and retinopathy... the trade off.
Why can't this physical perfect body/face thing go away. I realize it is hard wired into the human psyche bc that was what allowed us humans to choose the most healthiest partner to reproduce with. So I can see how people can run away with image. However, thankfully, there are a few and it is growing exponentially that realize that at face value, you are not necessarily choosing someone who is perfect for reproduction values. Especially when it comes to modern science and the ability to cure or manage so many diseases. What sickens me in the end is that these medically compromised individuals would risk their lives to be thin bc they think society will love them more if they are.
Wow. Messed up.
She has Angelina Jolie body.
Smoke some pot :)
thank god
I'm actually type 1 diabetic😋
13:07 smh
1st world problems hey
That's naughty.
Why..the fuck  do women just not want to work out to lose weight...I've seen and met so many stupid idiots that just starve themselves or I guess they do this shit  to try to lose weight . Just eat healthy and lift weights and walk
wait u dont need to go to the hospital just to give yourself diabeticshots. u have the thing with u and take the shot yourself or if your little somebody helps u
Let them decide.. coz they think they know more than the doctors. These are fucked up white people.. others are wannabe white people
Diabulimia isn't a real eating disorder. The diabetes has nothing to do with eating habits
I have a question for anyone who can help me.\n\nI have a friend who is has type 2 diabetes (she was diagnosed in her 20s) and she was very overweight. she had to take insulin shots as well. However, years back she stopped taking her insulin, started eating whatever she wanted (like, she could eat two whole meals from mcdonald's at the same time) yet she lost a crazy amount of weight. Without exercising she lost about 230 pounds. She became a skeleton. To this day she still refuses  to take her insulin and goes to the doctor only when she's admitted to the hospital. She loves the weight she's lost and doesn't want to go back. It kind of sounds like some of the problems people with Diabulimia have, but she's not a type 1 diabetic. Does anyone have any clues? I know the best thing would be to of course take her to a doctor, but she refuses.
this isn't a new disorder this is just people with anorexia who have an irrational phobia of insulin.
This is terrifying
Dr.sebi cured diabetes. There is no money in cured people.
This rules. Could we feature this on our show Highlight Reel? We link out/ credit every clip we feature.
Hey man, wich server/mod is this?
yo wanna trade sub?
Hey guys! I hope you enjoyed today's video! I'm so excited to finally start this years Halloween series it's gonna be a blast! Ps. I realise I said Mickey Mouse instead of Minnie Mouse, not sure why I did, I know the costume was Minnie's, i'm just silly haha!
Somehow you ended up looking good in all of these. #shook
I think some of these costumes meant to be for a slut so that's why it comes with a thong\n(I didn't mean that you're a slut of course💕)
MINNIE MOUSE. It's Minnie Mouse not Mickey Mouse lol
Hey Roxxsaurus... What do you do with the items you buy on EBAY that you don't like??
I woled keep the dress and buy the ears a Disneyland
My mom and dad made for me a Tinkerbell costume, when I was 7. Dad make a pair of giant fairy wings for me. The best year of my life
when she said mickey mouse and she mean minny mouse i died
i really love this series and definitely want more :) PS little roxi is so adorable!
COLLAB WITH JAZZYBUM!!YOUR LIKE YT TWINS!!
I
Blaise Nazli easy hairstyles and solve it💕💕☹️
The superwoman one looked so cute on you!
YASSSSSS THE HALLOWEEN SEASON IS FINALLY HERE!!!!
11:50 i sont get why she calls this long..its much cuter like that
that is Minnie mouse not Mickie mouse
I love all of these costumes!! Which will you wear for Halloween? x
What lipstick are you wearing?? It's awesome!
You call it a thong i cll it a g string
Minnie mouse (not sexual) comes with a thong. Mario (not sexual) comes with a thong. Bunny girl (very sexual) no thong. Why is the world so messed up??
Yaya! I'm a dinosaur now! Rawr! :')
that's a mini mouse costume not a mickey mouse
I think when you're Tinkerbell costume you put the wings on upside down
The underwars are for man ho thinks its funny to ware that 😂😂
Love this video xxx
Minnie mouse
Wth is there a thong
It almost pretty fast turned into a thong haul :D Don' t know what' s up with that ebay!
If you do another one of these, PLEASE BE ALICE IN WONDERLAND!! :D
what is with the female costumes including thongs? thongs look very uncomfortable.
November is normally the month when I grow out of clothes and i normally want to wear the costume I wore the year before for Halloween 👻 sooo that sucks
That's Minnie Mouse not Mickey Mouse 😂😂😂
She obviously likes very short costumes that are very tight.
You could make the Mickey Mouse ears stiffer by watering down some clear drying liquid glue and painting it on to them. The glue should stiffen the fabrich without making it look cheap.
Great video! Check to win 1 of 1000 halloween wigs here: http://bit.ly/spintowinwigs
you are meant to put them over your shoes
I'M SO READY FOR THE HALLOWEEN VIDEOS🤗❤. also side note: did anyone get kinda triggered when she kept valling Minnie mouse Mikey mouse?
Half of them r play suits
that costume is alice angel from bendy and the ink machine
That is VERY DEFINITELY minnie mouse.....\n\nLol whatever
Why do the costumes come with things ??
I’m pretty sure the wings were upside down 😕
The wings were upside down
Why are you so cute?! The minnie mouse were realy nice on you.
I don't understand. When did Halloween become a second carneval/ sexy flirt party? The costumes are meant to be scary and creepy! Not cute or sexy! Wtf??
It's not a wonder woman costume, it's super girl! :)
Roxxsaurus u cold put a red tutu on the superwoman costume
The boy that I love is called ibai if you speak spanish you'll understand it😍
Hi I just saw your channel and I loved it
Hey people, would you mind checking out @ThinkingOfThing on Twitter? My goal is just to make this dreary world a bit more positive :))\nThanks so much xx
💛💚💙💜
It's Minnie mouse
Love the makeup look💟
It's kind of sad that your merch looks like a Sara M Lyons whatever forever rip off. I'm not surprised because a ton of people have ripped her off with that design, but I'm disappointed to see you added to that list. 😢
THONGS!!!!!!! :P\nlol there so you don't have underwhere lines
Halloween is supposed to be scary?
you put the wings on upside down lol..
It's not marrio it's mario
Daaayyyym girl !! God bless u 💝 u look good in everything 💋
When she said Mickey Mouse when it’s supposed to be Minnie 😰😨😱
Hi guys, are there any small you-tubers out there that would like to support each other? I do beauty related videos with reviews and unboxings ♥ Thank you
It might come with thongs because the costume might be see through
It’s Minnie not Mickey
who else got a little irritated when she would say Mickie instead of mini lol but ily
All I could think about is the sexy pumpkin from himym 😂
I'm going to be a slut for Halloween. My favorite holiday.
Is it just me that automatically thought of slutty pumpkin from HIMYM when she was showing the pumpkin
You inspired me o b Mario for Halloween....thanks

Why..
*is this how to bold things*
It's a bit early to be thinking about halloween
this is what we thought we were doing when we built forts out of branches in our back yards as kids
TURN ON SUBTITLES ! lil reminder on how to get his commentary
Legend has it this man once spoke
Awesome video! Will you be firing these into a waterproof building material? If so, what will you be using as mortar? It seems clay wouldn't work as a mortar, seeing as it would dissolve in rain. I think you would be able to do something like this guy: https://youtu.be/qj7kr2ho800\nDo you have enough shelled animals to provide the calcium hydroxide? Keep the videos coming!
Nice work! I wonder if 500 years from now, someone will stumble across this site and mistake it for some advanced primitive society that existed thousands of years ago.
well i learned a lot from this guy.And i went with my family in a jungle type of island and we made things like he does them
If this guy isn't on YouTube rewind 2017 I swear to god.
HE USED THE THONGS!
So this is what the Israelite slaves do in Egypt to build pyramids that last for centuries.
It's best ASMR video :D
could you make a natural mosquito repellent in an upcoming video?
He's wearing his sandles YAY! You should make a cart with wheels and a wooden body, there's a good challenge for you. :)
I said it the first few pages of my notebook with instructions for how to build a hut from your videos
This man deserves so much, it's just great to see a guy going back to the roots
I tried this but they just crumbled after i cooked them for a couple hours.
Also, is the sun never shining there? Always so gray...
This is your masterpiece.
5 years later, a whole new kingdom will be built. Out of mud bricks.
He is op af, give him factory tools and he becomes even more broken
My first time watching this. and all I was thinking was, if everything was supposed to be primitive, why is he wearing pants? Shouldn't it be leaves?
And so you ask your self how did he get the battery for the camera
Wow, I feel that if my career doesn't go as planned, I'll just go live in the wild with only my survival ness skills, nature is always an option if you go homeless
Second video I've seen and I'm conviced. Subbed👍!
bunch of people were blatantly ripping off your content and I was monitoring their channels for a while. One of them got a lot of flak from the fans of this channel and drove them to change their channel name, now most of their videos don't reach 100k views anymore.\n*Great work bois*
Next vid should be how to get wifi in the jungle
How did I even get to this video?...
Ok so I got a question, if anyone could answer: Would it be possible to build a house from mud or clay and make a giant fire inside to cook it, so it would last years and be totally sealed ? Make it like terracotta  or baked clay.
Your just like, when u get kicked from the house you go like , DONT YOU KNOW MOM IM STILL STANDING BETTER THAN I EVER DID, LOOKIN LIKE A TRUE SURVIVER, BUT FEELING LIKE A LITTLE KID LOL, LIKE OF YOU AGREE LADS, MATE YOU GOT REAL SKILL
I tried to build a house a bit and I was outside for like 5 hours and it was like walking on hot coal \n\nP.s the resign I dint say legos cause I'm 11 and a few years ago I fell asleep in a giant mountain of legos
Where did he learn how to build like a caveman?
Theres probably villages still doing this. Nothing new.
If he just cloud find some iron
Wow very good work ,you are hired   to build new world trade centre towers lol

SON? YOUR DINNER IS GETTING COLD.
I wanna be like you 🐒🎵🎶🎵
When are you gonna start making planes out of rocks, clay, rope, and sticks?
I am fascinated by his skill in primitive building and his apparent impervious nature to insects. Where I live the mosquitoes and yellow flies will devour you in the Summer.
i think that Primitive techonolofy should invest on getting metal from rocks (metallurgy) to get more eficient tools such as axes or saws
is he building him an oven??
NOOOOO!!!! I just finished watching all his vids now I'm sad there's no more to watch your epic bro
Hey there Primitive Technology,\n \n'We have the best reason to say no, test it not, lest thee are prepared to meet thine maker.'
Can anyone tell me why he mixes in dried grass at 3:25?
I like your video most...hate those copied...like my comment if you think its true..greets from Malaysia
When can we upgrade to iron age ?
this guy showing kids how to make awsome forts
the last man on earth
Make a tree house. Like if you agree
This is probably the hardest working youtuber ever
This the guy I wanna be with when the apocalypse hits
When I saw him take that first tree down I knew he was a pro and this wasn't his first rodeo.
For those who don't have the money yet, 20 thousand years from now, this guy will build the iPhone x.
Great camerawork and interesting projects as always! Keep up the great work!
it would be cool to see him experimenting with like metal and stuff
This guy will survive the zombie apocalypse
Could you do more things like your your freshwater prawn trap, e.g hunting small fish and animals
This might be me after WW3.
So what was the whole point of this video
I want to have primitive sex with him.\n;)
I’ve watched this guys videos for 2 years now and I still have not heard him say one word. Can he talk?
Is it me or does he look a bit like James franco
Now the wolf wont be able to blow down the house...
Dude, u need to evole. U have been in stone age for too long. Its time to move to bronze age.... or maybe medival age????

I can neaten it up when we're like backstage or something. \n\n\n\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I wouldn't not only let Margot tattoo me, I would even let her succ my dikk
honestly how perfect can she get
What a lucky man!! \nHe got tattooed by MARGOT ROBBIE for God's sakes.. I'd be sweating all over the place if I was him!!  😂😂😂
Tattoes?!!
Don't try this at home gee lucky you made that disclaimer Graham, because I was just about to bring out my tattoo gun and ask my roommate to put on a blonde wig so he could tattoo my toe!
MARGOT IS HOT N THE TATTOO WAS FUNNY
Do we have to listen to constant Donald Trump sections on every single show?Graham did at least 40 last season on opening segments,we get the picture you don't like the bloke
Harrison Ford is a legend
US: Tattoo gun | UK Tattoo Machine. Get over it!
Thumbnail got me thinking she lost her arms.
Please don't call it gun...
0:48 She instantly looked at Gosling and said do you Who wouldn't want to touch Ryan gosling
totally agree, good show: smart and funny!!
Even it up backstage or something, if you catch my drift lol
I'd never wash my feet
She can tattoo my feet and much more\nLike please
I'd let her put some ink on me. Would be far from the craziest person I've let stab me hundreds of times.
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
Haha, I got a tattoo of a smiley face on my big toe about 7/8 years ago now and I often forget it's there
I would suck the hell outta his feet 😻
Ford...the absolute definition of class :)
Wow, this is #one on trending :).
I love her so much omg she got so excited!!! what a cutie
Let’s help out a young YouTuber :) \n\nhttps://youtu.be/GThT_j3ac4k
What movie is Robbie there promoting?
04:44 - Guy is pinching his finger trying to divert the pain. lol
Dangit, I want a tattoo from Margot Robbie of Margot Robbie!
Thought she's handicapped. Seriously.
That is actually kind of cool and i may possibly want to do this to myself..but i hate being a follower so i will come up with something other then an smiley face check out and stay tune on my channel to see me do this......aahhhhh I'm so exited
I hope he got something else back stage too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:P   8---------------D
What a great interview - and that guy's SOOOO CUTE. 😍
Did he just say tattoo gun? Bruh, it's a tattoo MACHINE
Love how the host talks over her
I woke up at this part.\n\nAnd other people would just come by the trailer and get anything and.. yeah, did all sorts of things.\n\nYEAH, I reckon I've done probably getting close to a 100 now.\n\nLITTLE ONES LITTLE ONES!\n\nAnyone seeing what I'm hearing? COUGH.
Could sit on my face any day of the week
Can i get 300 subscribers for my birthday tomorrow😓😢?Can you make a suprise😢😢?
The man(who got the tattoo) looks familiar. Isn't he an actor?
Hahaha reeese was like  omg, I want to be able to say I tattooed Harrison ford!
Who else thought the girl in the thumbnail had no arm?
I love how they call the machine “gun”.
I hope Margo and that staffer when on a date after!
Hell if I ever see Margot at a Comic Con. I'm bringing a tattoo machine just for a toe moji by her lol
The thumbnail made it look like she had no arms
Please sit on my face
Didn't realise how cute Margot Robbie is lol and of course hot as hell
this would be a dream come true to have Margot do a tattoo on me
Margot is so cute and funny she was so nervous when she says sorry xD..,I really love this show
I would LOVE a tattoo from Margot!
Every man likes a good foot rub 👌🏾
This is what television was invented for.
I would volunteer in a heartbeat. Having many tattoo's myself, it would be amazing to have one done by Margot. Even if it wasn't particularly great haha
Ayy Adam is hot AF n that *thats acting* line had me rolling😂😂
damm you, margot robbie! when i thought you couldn't get any more adorable. that's just... so lovely! hahaha <3

I get jealous when somebody comments twice and gets 1k likes in each of them
1:09 Ford is just getting Vietnam flashback
OMG THAT'S HARRISON FORD I DON'T CARE ABOUT MARGOT ROBBIE!!!!!
Now he has a fantastic story: when someone notice his tattoo he will tell this amazing story))
I so want Margot Robbie to tramp stamp me!!  *jealous*
In the thumbnail it looks like Margot doesn't have an arm
I want Margot to sit on my face;)
Aha, Margot is a total babe, I’d let her tattoo me any day of the week
Probably the most attractive couch he has ever had.
Graham Norton is tremendously great at breaking the ice between awkward moments which this was. Have at it with any other talk show host and this would have come off as damn cringy enough to click out of the video.
Unbelievable group of A-listers on the couch. Crazy

Bet his girlfriend broke up with him that day
Red colored socks ? what is he, Santa?
Margot in this interview was incredibly ungraceful and came off very spurious, from the way she talked to Harrison Ford to hanging out with Prince Harry to talking about Producing films(She's barely 4 years in the game, she has no business producing films yet) and I say this as a fan because she's the best of her generation(she's miles ahead of Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone(Emma Barely counts)) and she needs to be better and more genuine and needs to stop hanging out with the likes of Cara Delevigne
Size 41 isnt even big ffs! i wish i was that size! i have some long ass size 8.5/9(uk sizes) feet and it's so depressing to go shoe shopping cus they never have my size

Oh my God 🙆Patricia!! Tamara is fangirling over you while I am 😍😍😍fangirling over her being in your vlog!! Haaha and after that you bring in Lydia come onnnnn😵!! 3 of my fav youtubers in one video! NAILed it ahahaha get it 😝
What did she get done to her new hair it looks sooooooooooooo good😍😍😍
Patricia doesn't know how beautiful she is both inside and out. She has amazing features, smooth chocolate skin a lovely and easy to vibe with personality that enables her to socialise with all types of people. I hope she comes to accept that she has every right to be where she is, she is representing so many of us and she doesn't need to feel like she's not good enough because of her unique qualities 💯🙏❤
The dude in the back at 19:30 hahaha
that woman in the green velvet trench couldn't let you have your moment 😂 proper walked into your pic
Omg you're so gorgeous and Grace is the cutest baby I've ever seen
I love that black dress, it looks so gorgeous.
Is it just me that wants a make up tutorial from the Balmain show? Patricia was looking 10/10
I found you recently and don't usually like beauty/fashion youtubers but I recently went on a binge of those trying wish/romwe/shein videos and I found you. I really like your vids, editing style, personality and humour.
You glow girl !! So beautiful and powerful :-)
Your camera felt unworthy looking at Rihanna and simply died of shame 🙏🏻

My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything. I scoffed at him. Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line. Well...you see professor I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. I watch Rick and Morty. The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. ...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety. Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB! One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is. It's none other than Albert Einstein.
This whole video is completely irrelevant, like who the f wants to know how rick turned himself into a pickle, this is literally in a fictional cartoon.
How do I dislike multiple times
Dont worry they'll debate it out in the comments literraly no one is like A pickle is a fruit
A co creator of rick and morty asked me to subscribe to a guy making film theories....................................yep totally reasonable so im gonna go hit that bell thing

What the fuck! I am so annoyd that people try to make sense of Rick And Morty! The thing i love the most with it is that it is so far from reality as well as so close in a weird way.

Well if Dan Harmon tells me to subscribe I pretty much have to!
Like that Youtube jab at the end. Well played.
Your editing and jokes are cringy. I bet all of your subs are 12 and can't even grip the concept of Rick and Morty. They only watch it is because they swear and make some easy to understand jokes sometimes. You need to stop editing your self in there and stop using the eye editing its absolutely terrible, by far some of the worst on youtube. Your channel would be some what good if you were being  cringy on purpose but i happened to stumble apon this because I seen Rick and Morty fan theory but I can already tell this is all your content consists of will ever consist of. It was 15 minutes of childish edits, jokes, and nothing but cringe, and not even the good cringe. You can tell that you actually tried pretty hard on all this too and I'm sorry but it's so bad.  I wanna put a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger with my toes. Eating in entire box of salted crackers without a drink would be easier to watch then another one of your videos.
Subscribe to my channel
mat has a theory that you will be pickled about
I still don't get why Ricks work factories. Didn't our Rick make a butter bot in less than ten minutes?  Why are the citadel factories not fully automated? Are you telling me that Willy Wonka Rick doesn't care that he wasted a lot of resources on his workforce and that the worker ricks are to stupid to make a robots to do ther jobs for them?
Mat pat wins ps did not watch the end promise
11:30 PM on YouTube tomorrow, got it
Dan Harmon tells me to do so, and so I must.
So you mean to tell me these guys unwittingly made up a concept that could actually happen?
SCREE I'M SO EXCITED FOR EPISODE 10 TONIGHT
to all videos I watched in Film THeory, this is most THUMBS UP!!
I just watch The Film Theorists \n\n\n\n\n\nFor the bad puns
Do about IT pleaseeeeeeeee, I’m begging youuuu
Pickle rick stopped being funny a few days after the episode came out, the fa base has become cancerous
Drinking game every time they say pickle take  a shot
My question s why does rick have a face and mouth tongue and teeth where did those come from?
Technically, all fruits are vegetables.
Am I the only one that noticed Bill Cypher in season 3 episode 8?
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I invite all reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. We've always believed God rested on the 7th Day, but what about after that day? \n With All Of My Heart what I found is NOT Click Bait. All I ask is, after you watch, that you please take a few moments to consider just who God is before you comment. I can prove to anyone, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT, this proves it. Several times I've asked different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please I'm begging you to Help me Share this with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
To the bell thing!
I know this is nitpicking, but you got one MAJOR thing wrong.\nHypernatremia leads to brain cell shrinkage, not swelling. Free water will move from inside the cell to the outside. From higher concentration to lower concentration...OSMOSIS..
These theory channels suck dick now. Every video is the same.
can i get a like for free...im a big fan of rick and morty...notice me sempais
The rat part is pretty obvious, but I don't see any reason why Pickle Rick would be able to send out electrical impulses via his tongue. Yes there is electricity present, but that doesn't mean a significant amount of electricity is transferring.
Rick & morty is overrated trash, only sheep follow whats popular. Anime is much better, for adults & actually has nudity and other stuff, not for kids at all.
Athletic other administration everybody complete smart furthermore closed indicator literature rarely.
Dan Harmon is on everything in youtube
Ayy,MatPat how much damage can an ultraman make to the city?
I admit it, I ended up subscribing but it was only because I appreciate all the effort you put into making your videos
Have you seen a SECRET AIRPORT ENTRANCE https://youtu.be/JOPBo4iJhEk
Please watch this video too guys \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyQCn8spOBE&feature=youtu.be
Before I watched this video, I binge watched all the main episodes of rick and Morty, and holy shit this show is perfect
mat pat is 0 years old every sub is 1 year how old will he get?
I SAW U ON REACT

Not sure if you really need an electric charge from his body in the initial encounter with the roach, if he was a pickle and his salt content was as considerably high then merely touching his brain might work similar to the 'Dancing squid bowl dish in Hakodate'', my understand of this is that since nerves are controlled by potassium-sodium pumps and nerves are typically triggered when an electrical or chemical change causes the nerve to reach their action potential at which point they fire like normal. its been a while since bio so might have gotten a few things wrong , link here if you want to see a similar reaction between octopus and soy sauce though be warned its kind of disturbing since its kind of reanimating a dead octopus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxQmOR_QLfQ
That “Tales From The Citadel” episode is up there in one of my favorite episodes, it was so unexpected.
dan harmon told me to subscribe...imagine my shock when i saw i wasn't yet. (click)and done.

Думал у Вас что нормальное посмотрю, но Ютуб говно везде, хоть какую страну выбирай.
When I saw this movie I though it was a adult or child movie so I passed it I didn't want to watch it so I want to watch amazing world of gumball it's my favourite movie but it was so dum it couldn't search it I was crying in bed so I watch somthing else and I had to go sleep it was so sad XD
Pickle Rick is Still Rick  which means he should be able to dunk him self in seshwan sauce and eat it ....... or him self
*4th o n  t r e n d i n g*
But in the wirly dirly episode, it is revealed that some of ricks organs are robotic, so maybe he could survive after all?
This is a total normie video. Pickle Rick memes and saying that this series is not scientific it's like the cringey musical.lys
we all missed the most important fact Rick says there's infinite dimensions however he can only live in very few universes that are similar why is that it goes to a theory that says each decision you make creates another universe if you watch rixty minutes it's right there and we all missed it its why Rick in all dimensions has the portal gun it's why his family died in the first episode of season 3 it was his memory from an alternate Ricks universe where he chose not to accept it but because it's his memory it was there it was not false go watch rixty minutes again and put 2 and 2 together
I make terrible YouTube videos\nhttps://youtu.be/71mtIeBn6I8\nSee how bad they are
OMG I paused this video and stayed up until 6:00 AM just to catch up on rick and Morty so that this video wouldn't spoil anything then I COULDN'T STOP WATCHING....... look what you made me do Matpat.
Sub - No Homework for a year \nLike - No Homework for a week\nReply - No Homework for a day\nIGNORE - Homework for the rest of your life\n\nChoose for yourself.
Evil morty is going to be in the episode!
strawberries aren't berries!!

What if Rick implanted a salt filtering device around his brain so it wouldn't be swimming in salt? You're welcome, MatPat. You owe me one grand.

Damn Jay Z looks old!
Damn what's with all the hating?
New York Jew York Where trump made his money. that is where the six million fake Holocaust victims went > Manhattan and outer New York they are everywhere and the Crypto Jews are in the 50 million range
Fuck jay z 🖕🏻 wish I could throw my sneaker in his ugly fucking face.🖕🏻
Its your girl lovely from Sacramento Ca \nSUBSCRIBE and Like your girl page\nI'll show you what that Sac life about...\nSac business\n😘😄😄aaaayyyeee
jay's voice similar to Michael Jackson's Voice
Nobody asked me, but I don't like Ryan Gosling.
Age is really starting to hit Jay
That nigger looks like a straight up monkey.
My brain don't work no more.
Oh, so that's how rich people laugh ;-)
one guy is a boring, bland asshole....the other is a frog faced convict that stopped being relevant like 10 years ago.....
Jay Zzzzzzzzzzzz was that a song.? Talking and saying yeah every once in a while Zzzzzzzzzzz I'm going to bed what the heck was that Zzzzzzz
I am Jay-Z and am going to make a fool of myself. Suck it!
When you appear on snl you know your career is on life support.
Jay-Z like..'m not old I'm Jay-Z
Im wacthing this on my tv right now lol😅🎬💻📺
Fuck trump and his supporters 😂😂😂😂 come at me .
Ryan he's all I need!!!!
well that was awkward.
Screw JZ.  Drug dealing, womanizing, greedy, piece of shit.  \nWouldn't have opened this notification had I known he was here. \nThrow up.  \nSNL is desperate.
SNL tonight???? So the cry baby will be leash out in Twitter tonight? Lol
Is Jay okay? If he's not, someone call Beyoncé. Maybe she could get him some Lemonade.
Ryan is ugly af I don't understand why people think he is cute and shit
Funny how all these comments are saying Jay-Z looks old as shit.\n\nIf there's one guarantee in life it's that each and every one of us is going to get old as shit and look like shit. Trust me, you fellas WILL have balls sagging to your knees, and you ladies WILL have tits sagging to your stomachs, and will all have several facial wrinkles to match.\n\nAt the end of the day, Jay-Z likely made more money than all of you will make in your lifetimes - combined. Take that to the bank.
ryan gosling sucked last time , why do we have him again for host/?
This is an snl I might actually watch
If this was awkward check out Nono2x https://youtu.be/sV2t3tW_JTQ
That was cool, you know what else is cool? my new video check it out :) thank you, I will really appreciate it,
Jay Z what was that all about it was only on for a minute if that never did like your music 😂
Can't Stand Ryan\nDude thinks his shit doesn't stink. Shitty Actor as well. Very overrated
This is the most awkward shit I've ever seen...
I can see those baby twins are getting to jay z he look sleepy as Hell. Lmao
Fuck jay z
GayZ is so cool
That nigga jay is OLDDdddddDdddDddd
fuck you gay asses slave jayz iluminati is fucking your kids
Jay Z sucks balls
Jay-z looks sick

We're impressed!!! NEXT!!!
Everyboyd keeps saying jayz looks old😂
Jay Z... shave dat sh*t
Yo Check This Out \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qyVqYts4vCM
Gosling felt great after Jay said I remember. It's that feeling you get when that one girl says she noticed you from way back when but you thought she didn't even see you. Then you tilt your head laugh in shock and pee a little. Priceless.
Y is jay z such a lil cutie
SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL AND I WILL SUBSCRIBE BACK!\n\nTHANKS :)
Who watches this show. Trending that's a joke
When Jay Z smiles that means we get 2 more days of Christmas
jus heard jz on snl\nwho buys that shiz???

Why Jay looked Photoshop person there in the thumbnail?
😂😂😂I like how Ryan just understands Jay Z
You might as well just do the entire the show on Trump impressions. Skip all the guests.
Jay still that dude
Jay Jizzle
Were the fuck is Kanye when you need HIM?
JAY Z LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE USED HIS FACE AS A TOILET AND TOOK A SHIT ON HIS FACE..
Jay-Z looks like he's getting too old for this sh*t.\n\n\n\nalso, he looks a bit like Danny Glover in hip-hop clothes.
Eww now I have to watch SNL
I don’t understand how Jay Z is famous. His “talent” is putting unoriginal poetry to dog shit synthetically produced music. (If you can even consider it music)
Why aren't they on their knees?
Love how Golsing doesn't seem to give a fcuk who Jay is. The way it should be. Much props to Ryan bro, you are a legend in the industry, after Rob and Nicolas Cage you're up there
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

JAY Z IS SO SERIOUSLY BORING!
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
Old man dressing like that is just weird to me.
This whole time ive been pronouncing Ryans last name wrong.

I remember when SNL was funny, not just a Leftist PR machine selling carefully constructed opinions inserted into TERRIBLE jokes told by complete sell out HACKS.. it’s all so fucking transparent it makes me sick. We are all fed lies and propaganda 24/7.. every network is selling us the same agenda, packaged as “entertainment” - now THATS the only joke to be found on TV these days.. SAD.
Fuck that black piece of shit jay-z. He looks fucking retarded and everyone agrees that if he didn't have money or was popular with blacks liking his music that Beyonce would never even look at him
I hate little kids
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought he looked annoyed her mom should have been paying attention😂😂💀
Little did you know, the toddler is still sneakily stealing the popcorn
She later went off to steal the Queen's crown and the Declaration of Independence.
Really disappointed about the lack of comments around how useless the royal family is.
This is high treason execute the girl!
Hope he's a bit more generous with CHARLOTTE!!
Fuck the Royal family, give back the 6
That's so cute:)
Me if I was in the presence of a royal.

Hey guys! Please take 2 minutes to listen to my first ever 🔥Trap Song🔥 I worked really hard on it and really need some feedback! Thanks for supporting me!❤️\nhttps://youtu.be/80wwX_j4WKc
why the fuck is this on trending
And that's how that little girl lost her right hand
Way to teach your stupid kid some manners... just going to be another self entitled woman who thinks every guy is her personal ATM.
CUTE\nPs: Don't read my name
Off with her head
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I invite all reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. We've always believed God rested on the 7th Day, but what about after that day? \n With All Of My Heart what I found is NOT Click Bait. All I ask is, after you watch, that you please take a few moments to consider just who God is before you comment. I can prove to anyone, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT, this proves it. Several times I've asked different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please I'm begging you to Help me Share this with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno

De ce e in trending?
the end is nigh...soon you benefit scroungers will be chased out the country
I can't believe people are saying I hate how that parent isn't stopping her like bro she is just a little toddler. It was cute, it wasn't like she was doing anything harmful to him.
Dont blame baby's mom,probably she's very shy to scold up her daughter in front of Prince..atleast that baby girl made our day happy..ohh well she's so cute.😍\n\n#mabuhayPhilippines
Have you seen a SECRET AIRPORT ENTRANCE https://youtu.be/JOPBo4iJhEk
lots of stupid non sense comments here, little girl is so adorable dough.
Mom is watching not giving 2 shits bout Harry at all XD
Where is the parenting?! So embaressing. Not cute!! Rude af!!
What a cool dude. Ain't he the prince in the military? Sorry if I come off as ignorant I don't pay much attention to British royalty
I would take whole bag, at least he have money for new one.
Did they have a camera directed at Prince Harry the whole time?
The mom is an M.I.A. She didnt do anything her child is eating the prince's popcorn but she is like Lalalalala not my child
The mom was ok with it?
this is the cutest thing
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
He was pissed at first, then realised he was probably being recorded so he tried to act nice looooooool
Well what do u expect if there is a giant popcorn bag right in front of u
imagine a adult trying that xD
1 Like = u will have no homework tomorrow \n1 Sub = u won't have to go to school tomorrow \nDo both and I will sub to u just comment done ✅
Roses are Red\nViolets are Blue\nI wasn't first\nAnd neither were you
Her mom just let her steal the popcorn 😭👌🏿
I woulda dropped that kid for touching my food
Cute but I'm pretty sure her mum knew she was doing that. She should have stopped her
Good reason to always be on your best behavior. You never know who is watching or filming. Lol
once he saw what the little girl was doing I guess he did make a new friend!!
Tbh this is likely due to England letting in all those niggies into their country who then influence future generations into thinking that stealing is okay.
This is 1on trends in Portugal
That's cute, although the mum did see her daughter taking popcorn quite a few times, then pretending not to see it.. and did nothing lol! Props to Prince Harry dealing with it in the best way!
i want some popcorn too
*P I C K P O C K E T    100*
If a little girl eating his popcorn gets it to trending on Youtube, imagine what would happen if he was eating the little girl's popcorn.
Aaah this is so adorable and cute to see : )\nThere is also more cute stuff to see on my channel for your child : )\nFeell free to give any comments and suggestions of what you would like to see in the future Bye :)

Funny, but fuck that music.
I'm offended by the body shaming on this channel. Every person is literally a stick figure!!!!
Who didn't watch this?
Tinder is a spot for desperate chicks advertising their Instagram to desperate guys they usually avoid
You forgot the “No hook ups” part
You forget girls that are not into hookups. You know, those dumb sluts who don't know what tinder is for.
Holy shit this was too accurate
You mean basic bitch... why White? They all send pussy and tit pics real quick
#8 on trending I'm so proud of you
everybody on tinder has a fucking kid and wants someone just to take care of the little bastard.
This is a compiliation of all the cringy things you could ever think of mushed into a tinder profile I can't
What's this venmo you speak of?! 👩🏾‍💻
See ya in one financial quarter.
EVERY TINDER GIRL. They must be into beastiality today.
Girls likin dog dick i knew it, sam just confirmed somethin we all knew :'(
Tinder the place where people put come and chat with me I'm waiting on the profile... wonder if they know you need to match to chat.
You forgot to mention the numerous  bots and fake profiles.
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica nice the office reference from jim
Most girls are boring as hell
Thank goodness I was on withdrawal Sam. Hopefully it’ll last me for a couple of months.
My name is in the basic white girl names, but with a (correct?) and unique spelling
My bio says damn are you my gpa because I know i could do better but I'm too lazy to actually try
This is an every blank ever
Why is this in trending tho
I like the Office, hiking, travel and dogs. If I super liked you it was by accident. I love my dog more than I'll ever you tbh. No fuckbois.
You should have smosh (Ian and Anthony do Every Tinder Ever

I like to eat good food, have good time with friends, travel and laugh
Thank god I'm Asian so no Tinder for me
I met a pretty girl on tinder but she poked me and it's not with her finger!😣
The top 1% of males get 99% of the female swipes. If you aren't a male model or could be one then don't bother. Practice telling jokes, create social bonds, and build your career. Much better use of time.
You forgot the obsessed disneyland girls.
Tinder is that app where you hook up with strangers, right?
Also the 30% of spam profiles with add me on Kik for easy sex only put this up when I'm looking to meet
Aha, watching this high off my ass
Venmo me $5 and see what happens
This is why women are the problem. They make men think they're the boring ones while they are basically all clones of each other.

Hi from russia)))

This is gonna sound so creepy but your feet are so nice
This was so relaxing and inspiring! Candles really set the mood and I love that you and Jim take time to yourselves at the end of the day. That's so important especially when you live with your S.O.
I've been using the neutregena hydra boost moisturizer for the last year and I'm hooked. Almost done my 2nd jar (costco size). I have normal to dry skin and I find this actually plumps up and hydrates my skin. First ever moisturizer than actually made a difference for my skin! ☺️ Love it!
Your only West Ham for fuck sake. What are you expecting 😂
You have a right to your opiniion..fuck them other fans...u pay there money like anyone 1 else
Made it on to the trending page lads!
It’s 3 points stop your moaning
What's the point of wearing a black t-shirt underneath a black bomber jacket
We're only just a year or so into a long term project. Stability does not appear overnight. We need to be patient. COYI.
For me it is not that we did not score till the 90th minute but that we waited until the 78th minute to react to the fact that we had offered no attacking threat all game and needed to address that.
you won 1 nill...you nearly pulled it back against spurs...its early season - stop moaning
This is me in the video! I had a few beers and with the height of emotions I may not of delivered myself the best I could of. My simple point is why is Bilic bigger than club suddenly? 1 good season put of 3 and we're going backwards not forwards but for voicing that opinion I get called multiple names & threatened. The paying fan is entitled to his opinion. If you dislike it, don't listen. Football is a game of opinions. I pay good money to see West Ham. So I am entitled and will voice my opinion however I see fit. No progression under board and manager is enough for me to call time.
Blue jacket man and his son love getting in the shot don’t they
You can never expect to win any team in the prem!
Ahahahah what's funny is you an Swansea are on the same level
If Bilic goes and we improve, great! To be honest I think if he goes we will get relegated... we have a team of miss matched players, no midfield at all and a board that fits in the whole picture as well...
How the fuck this on trending
you pikey shit are just as shit as the WELSH SCUM.
Does this idiot know that tottenham drew with swansea???
Sir Alex Ferguson's Man Utd side were one of the greatest sides of all time; they are almost unrivaled in terms of consistent success. How many games did they win in stoppage time? If West Ham had scored in the 1st minute and put in the exact same performance he wouldn't have complained
Think it's quite obvious that Bilic should go. Never has a game plan but can't see who we can attract tbh. Can see the board sticking it out till the end of the season
Bilic OUT! It's a fucking joke 😣
You're fucking West Ham. Not cheering when your team scores is pathetic. What is the point in going to games if you dont feel happy? Even when your team score and win the game? Absolutely deluded, you cannot compare yourselves to the likes of spurs yet. It takes time to get to that level. You have fantastic foundations to push on to that level, but it requires patience.
Spurs only drew 0-0 with Swansea , he was using Spurs as a barometer .
Propa nortee
I reckon this fan was verbally abused.
Spurs won 4 nil u plump cretin
no one cares BLUD
So now we're not celebrating even when we score a 90th minute winner! What the f*ck is the matter with everyone. 'We should be beating these teams 3-0' Ridiculous comment. Where does this deluded sense of entitlement come from. We are becoming worse then Spurs fans. We ground out a result against a team that's difficult to score against. We now finally have Lanszini our main playmaker back from injury. How about we actually get behind the team and the manager? Seems to me half of our fans actually want us to lose games so that they have an excuse to slag off Bilic, disgraceful
And why would Rafa go to West Ham 😂😂😂
Come on ancelotti
Idiot
Hammers shutttttt...fml...
Finally! Somebody says it.
Bilic out
I love bilic but he needs to go unless he can turn it round soon
You sure the verbal abuse you've been getting has nothing to do with that fuckboy haircut?
Tottenham beat Huddersfield 4-0 not 3-0
Fans being bit harsh on our team. We got about average squad for the league. Most matches gonna be tight. We will win some and lose some. We ain't close to top 6

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I invite all reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. We've always believed God rested on the 7th Day, but what about after that day? \n With All Of My Heart what I found is NOT Click Bait. All I ask is, after you watch, that you please take a few moments to consider just who God is before you comment. I can prove to anyone, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT, this proves it. Several times I've asked different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please I'm begging you to Help me Share this with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno

me encanto Beyoncé 😍😍😍😍
I saw featuring beyonce , i click it ,, its so simple
I prefer the original though :/ just my opinion

This song makes me wanna wake up my alarm clock
Houston, Texas, USA, We love Beyoncé , Houston we are still here , Love our city, 😃
esta genial, mucho mejor que la original. chulísima
Que mierda le pasa a la voz de beyonce
Esta cancion necesita un poco mas de beyonce ❤️❤️❤️❤️ MAXIMA DIVA ❤️
¡Hola a todos y bienvenidos a mi pequeño mundo! Estoy harto... Realmente estoy hasta los mismísimos!! No sé vosotros pero yo estoy muy cansado de la música que se esta haciendo popular hoy en día (bueno... ya hace un tiempo). Lógicamente con la palabra popular ya quedan exentos el rock, el metal, punk, jazz, blues y todos los tipos que sean del estilo. Con música popular me refiero al jodido dubstep, el tecno, la música electrónica, el intento de rap, el intento de reaggue y toda esa música que representa más caras bonitas que a ella misma... Ah! Y por supuesto no me olvido del repetitivo y asqueroso reggaeton. \n\nRealmente me siento estafado en este juego que representa la vida, en la parte musical claro. Para mi hemos perdido de calle... (aunque no se contra quien jugamos). Solo sé una cosa... antes lo que se escuchaba era a Freddie Mercury, Bob Marley, Ray Charles... y ahora escuchamos a Kiko Rivera, al Justino Bieber, a varios compositores de reggaeton que nos lo va a conocer ni su madre en unos años, a raperos falsos... De verdad, me gustaría saber que pensarán las generaciones futuras de nuestra música (seguramente que eramos imbéciles...).\n\nPorque decidme vosotros... ¿Que ha pasado que ahora parece  mejor un conjunto de sonidos que hacen casi explotar nuestro cerebro y tener ataques epilépticos a un bonito, excelente, currado solo de guitarra? ¿Por que preferimos (la mayoría...) unas voces retocadas con el maldito Auto Tune a un verdadero cantante? ¿Por que hay gente que le gustan esas canciones donde a las mujeres se las trata como animales, como escoria? ¿¿¿¿Qué ha pasado????\n\nEn serio, parece que ahora solo triunfan los que encima de una base ponen un montón de efectos, los que tienen una cara bonita y los hacen famosos por esa razón o aquellos que hacen el estilo ya sea rap, reaggue... pero no se les ocurre nada mejor que poner letras estilo reggaeton. Coño! Si quieres hacer rap, reaggue o cualquier otro tipo de música no tienes que ponerle letra como si fuera reggaeton y decir cosas como mis gatitas mamasita... ¡Realmente no lo soporto!\n\nAsimismo muchas de las canciones de ahora si os fijáis usas siempre los mismos acordes una y otra vez, ¿No hay imaginación? Supongo que ya la gastan toda con las letras tan originales... \n\nTambién quiero decir que con este post no quiero decir que no hayan cantantes buenos, claro que si! Simplemente que ahora forman un grupo reducido en contra de todos los otros. Todo por el jodido dinero...\nY vuelvo a decir lo mismo... no es que no haya buenos cantantes y buenas canciones, simplemente que no es lo que gusta ahora, no da moneey!!\n\nAle... ya me he quedado a gusta dando mi opinión...\n\nComo siempre espero que os haya gustado y que nos veamos en el siguiente post!!\n\nPero antes de irme... ¿Qué pensáis vosotros?\n\nChauuu!!\nEdit:\nFuente: http://www.pelibloguista.com/2016/02/la-musica-de-hoy-en-dia-es-pura-mierda.html?m=1

Who is here before 100M
waittttt a minute beyonce singing in spanish this remix is going viral in a few days like despacito
The beat is lit as fuck!!!🔥🔥🔥
It's sad that it takes a well known Western singer to make these songs popular. I'm not a fan of hijacking songs like this and Bieber with Despacito. This song is as good without Beyoncé.
When nobody cares about Malu Trevejo being in this music video because she is an irrelevant little girl xo
¿Esto es de verdad o es mentira? No se que pensar 😂
No me canso de escuchar este tema
No me gustó como canta en español la vd, fue mejor el remix de despacito con justin bieber
Si se preguntan xq últimamente predominan los comentarios en portugués... solo recuerden: 200 millones de brasileños xD\nPd: Eso es más que la población de Argentina, México y Peru... unida. :v
Un poco basura la canción con Beyonce, una cagada
La buena publicidad de fairy :v
Like si eres español :V
Te queroooo Beyoncé

quien coño es Anita?
Omg Brazilians are always everywhere WTF? They are like a plague!
I'm only here for Azul
I've got just one question WHY???
Que significa cuando dice azul?
can't believe there's an idiot  shouting finish the song
Justin Bieber can actually be seen cutting the cables. When will his madness stop?
HAHA.. DUDE IS YELLING  YOU PUSSY AHAHHAHA Starting after 2:32
It looks like a giant cross falling on his fat ass. Jesus has been waiting for this for nearly 25 years!
Sweet dreams lol
2:03
And the music keeps playing. They didnt stop the recording.
schadenfreude
бог все видит!
We need to ban gun props.
Russian hackers did it 😆
Yo, we want a refund !
Great performance as usual by Manson, but he seemed to be a bit under the gun.
The Fuse check it out \nhttps://youtu.be/B-3hQfTAfqY
To save you listening to that dirge, the good bit starts 2 minutes in. Your welcome.
Setup to milk that insurance company for millions. Nice, Manson. Get your lawyers ready to go
Too many trolls in that comment section.
Satanic MK ULTRA.....go with lucifer!!!!! Is not Manson.....but just MASON and illuminati hahahahahaha....
Oh no! What would we do without um.....what were we talking about?
A while back, I was in a bar in Shreveport filming a friend's band. Marilyn Manson was at the bar, drinking alone, and the family of Dez Duron was having dinner at a table nearby. Dez's family owns a church. I am surprised walls didnt fall down that night.
God sees everything. Greetings from Russia.
Manson pushing 60 years old now so this  innocuous  tumble could cause injury.
Hope he doesn't die, but if he does, they'll have to stop saying Guns don't kill people, people kill people.
Why are all the people still cheering after it fell and he stayed down???  Assholes.
Hi!\n\nMy name is David and I am a reporter working for VG in Norway. We are doing a story about this, and we are wondering if it is OK with you if we use your video. We will make sure to credit you for the video. \n\nAll the best,\n\nDavid Vesteng
RIP MM\n\nDied a few hours ago :(
it's manson's fault.  this is what happens when you sound like shit, did too many drugs, and eat a lot of fatty foods.  i'm so glad i saw him in '96 in his prime and not this hot mess.
Were the tickets returned?
Holy shit, hope he's ok
Hail Satan? (voice goes higher when saying Satan)
Hi there, please may we publish 30 seconds of this video on Mirror.co.uk with a credit to you? Many thanks
As someone who sets up for concerts and Corporate events. They should have sandbagged the fuck out that shit if likes to hang around props. Isn't he like a big dude?
Hello. BBC News here. Did you film this? If so, do we have your permission to use it on our online/TV/online output crediting you?
*IT'S A FAKE NEWS VIRAL STUNT FOR HIS UPCOMING ALBUM RELEASE, YOU DUMB, GULLIBLE GOYIM...!!*
Love how the rest of the band continues to play on
How heavy is this thing anyway? They seemed to easily lift it off him like it didn't weigh much. That's what you get for repeatedly bashing your drummer in the head with a mic stand. He rocked on.
Oh no, get well soon Mr President Marilyn Manson
...and just as he's screaming out, some of them want to be ABUSED..., this happens.
Good work on moving him all over the place before deciding this is a bad idea..
i love how the fans are cheering after it had fallen.  Do it Again Do it Again!!
WHY HIM. WHY. WHY -NOT JUSTIN BIEBER- DOES IT HAVE TO BE THE GREATEST PERSON EVER .. prayers for Brian❤\nEdit: some people are easily offended so 😂😂
Look at all those fucking phones...
Hopefully this will make him a better artist. I know he will not die cuz he is one stubborn SOB! I just wonder if the prop was loose on purpose or it was truly an accident. Either way still fucked up! But hey he was already a fucked up individual. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😈😈😈😈😈😈🌹🌹
Well, some roadie's out of a job for not securing that shit down.
Guns don't kill people... oh
Best Video on Youtube EVER!
This accident was staged to show how powerful our symbols can be without the nagging dialogue of our personal contentions.  An apt, brilliant metaphor to show how our own virtues can turn around and defeat ourselves.
*S  W  E  E  T     D  R  E  A  M  S*
Damn!... Ouch... Hope it's just scrapes and bruises.
допелась и допизделась, свинья!!!!
1). играют-то под фанеру..\n2). Russia had nothing with it.. это если опять нас будут обвинять.\n3). конструкция, видимо, не такая уж и тяжелая.. видно как ее потом легко подняли и откинули..\nММ, скорее всего, просто пожилой человек.. как бы на сцене он и не выглядел..

Thanks God!

Get better soon Brian 😪❤️
Lmao DDD super idiot
Immortal Manson.
HAHAHAHA
Did he died?
Sweet dreams.
hahahaha numb skull
hahajaja pusy
Ohhhh fuck, fuck, fuck. I hope he's okay. FUUUUUUCK. :(
I hope he's okay.  I guess I'll see on Monday.  He's supposed to be at House of Blues Boston.  I know that if it's cancelled he'll reschedule but I'm just worried about him.
Universe: hint. Stop performing and rest on your laurels.
Pretty messed up that Twiggy gave zero fucks ... Welp that's what happens when you booze, brah ... see ya
*_ FINISH THE FUCKING SONG...!! _*\n*_ FINISH THE FUCKING SONG...!! _*\n*_ FINISH THE FUCKING SONG...!! _*\n*_ FINISH THE FUCKING SONG...!! _*\n*_ FINISH THE FUCKING SONG...!! _*
Guns kill people
Can't believe people are yelling Don't Be A Pussy... Finish the fucking song
HOLY SH*T!!! Damn, I hope that he is OK!
He has passed away. RIP.
the bigger shock is that people actually go to his concerts.
God he sounds like shit.
He's alright. Rigged.
I want to punch the idiot calling him a pussy!
Lands on him just as the cymbals crash... illuminati confirmed!
What a weak performance. Then he tried climbing it or something. What a fucking tard.
Fuck with Trump, you get the horns
так тебе и надо пидарас! не хуй лезть в политику и пиздеть про другие страны, пидор! я давно удалил все твои песни что у меня были, надеюсь теперь ты удалишься из жизни, и тебя выпилит судьба! кричи как сучка!
Sweet dreams little gothic man, sweet dreams. Rip
HAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dave grohl broke his leg and continued,this diva rushed to hospital after hurting his leg
OK, so a 50 lb prop fell on the man. I am a 110 lb woman and my 210 lb man falls on me every night. I'm still alive.
Nice playback there....
R.I.P. he died just a few minutes ago 😭
El satanismo esta en último respiro
y siguen tocando csm
I guess you can say this incident put holes in (a lot of people's) happiness
Walk it off dick!!
I feel so bad for him and that massive twat shouting at them needs his head kicked in. I don't even like this band. God damn. The disrespect!
He would be much better if he was dead.
His career has crashed now his stage
Bad karma for all his negative songs
are you still going to do the giant hornet sting?
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT IT'S UGLY
It looks like my ex.\n\n\nThat I never had because I'm forever alone.
Since frog-fish have more amphibian-like properties, are they some of the most advanced fish on the evolution scale?
8:05 i keep watching it's mouth open xD
when that mouth opened all the way wide i was so done
You should do a blob fish
You should have showed a feeding test so we can see how big the mouth really is😢 can you do it in the next adventure 😞
They found one on my mom's island and ppl were saying it's Satans son and I tried to explain them that it's just a frogfish 😂
Look at this fish its so amazing
What is worst, bullet ant bite, or stepping on a lego? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy answer is, they're both equally painful.
Hey Coyote im really like your adventures, but i have a idea ¿can you make an encounter with one of the mammals in Northamerica, the american bison? Can you do that for me? I will really liked , thanks
I love your videos and adventures there so exiting even though I'm 8 years old i still look for animals everywhere
I caught up  tuna one octopus and 2 frog fish
liked and subscribed and your the best YouTube ever💖💖💖💖💖💗💗💗💗💖💖💖
The background music is way too loud that it's so annoying to go through the whole video. But, great vid by the way.
A fish is a Walleye, Northern, Sunny.
Get stung by a queen wasp if it's to risky don't do it
Does the frog fish it frogs in the sea
Since the frogfish has a little Luer does it make it actually more like a anglerfish? Except a lot nicer looking not so many sharp teeth?
I SUBCRIBED AND LIKED :D\nI LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Coyote please do an episode on the red panda
Trie to catch a toad fish
Coyote Peterson can you do a video on the monkey slug caterpillar
This fish needs to stay hydrated 🙄
And thus the events of Nemo has begun
I still remember you played pokemon go and you go crazy
this fish looks really cute ... I want to pet it
I went to the aquarium on kemah today :)
you should get a bass fish
wait a sec you mean pacific ocean in the phillipines no way we alive in the phillipines
Does anyone feel bad for the first frogfish it keeps banging th sides to get at and in 10:22 it's choking on air
It's a fish eat fish world
I just had to subscribe this was just to interesting not to. ☺
I like their fin legs
It would be awesome to see some behind the scenes episodes..
I love the frog fish
wow the fish looks like me when I wake up.
Coyote, can you please do a video over a western hognose snake. It would really make my day. Ive always wanted one just no pet store near me sells them. I love every animal, insect, arachnid, coral, etc and I just would love to see you handle it and teach others about them. Love your work👍🏼
Could you try to capture a huge katydid?
I like how the sound effects go with the movement of the frog fish big mouth sounds and trumpet sounds for the jets
Coyote come to Guam it has unique animals here
The Amy Shumer fish is going to be harder to find.
They should do a blob fish and be like this is a blob fish😐
Love you and I love your channel coyote I think you should do a video about some animal in the Delcome
Looks like a bunch of black heads
Coyote can you enter the punch zone of the mantis shrimp?
coyote how come u always were that bracelet on your left hand??
Tomorrow you should be at the LA Zoo
It's so cool 😝
Pls try to find an octopus or a cuttlefish or something
have you ever been bitten by a wheel bug? if not you should try it, it hurts really god damn bad though!
Now I understand why he made his own book
Lol I caught one of those while fishing when I was 4

What that mouth do?
Someone give him a discovery channel show pronto
They need to work on their high-five
You should come to Okinawa Japan in your next adventure in beyond the since we have a lot of different sea creatures here. I go scuba diving with my dad all the time here and every time we see something new
pinched by a coconut crab. thank you
I'm coyote Peterson and I'm about to enter the pinch zone with the pincher47 1.2.3 here we go...ahhhhh(mark)are you ok(coyote)it feels like a ak47 ahhhhhhh!!!!!

Dude you should be a TV show
When you going to do a warrior wasp?
It would be nice if you could, and should work with the Kratt bro's
Do a badger attack

BRO THAT THING IS HIDEOUS!!
خیلی خفن بود \nدمتون گرم
I just realised, when fishes are in fish tanks they must be amazed by the new terrain 🤔 They’ve never been outside of water or seen whats outside so that must’ve been an interesting experience for the fish
3:49\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many likes......
Hey Brave Wilderness!! You should pick guests to go experience with you! I'd love to see the action in person!!! ❤💯💯
Looks like the fish from the Simpsons
Aha, I’m high as fudge right now, this whole video is trippin me out
Coyote you won't go to the bite zone with a great white shark... no balls
Freddie is pretty cool
Are frogfish instinct?
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this deep dive into a different side of the ~mannequin challenge~ (jk it's nothing like that). hope u guys enjoy! would u wear any of this? xo, saf
The Zara outfit looks like something a lovechild of Willy Wonka and an oompa loompa would wear
I actually loved the topshop outfit on you Saf
Gotta be honest, most of those stuff are pretty damn ugly LMAO But at least Safiya is wearing some colors, YAY !
The first outfit is really good
I love the Hollister one!! I want it 😍
How do you suit everything 😩😩
if you have ever worked in retail you know how dressing mannequins and not usually putting stuff that it wears next to the window works :P i love those TopShop pants btw
I loved the glasses from Top shop
your content is always interesting!
The backpack/purse you are wearing with the Hollister outfit, where is it from? It is so cute!
You should totally do a thrift store haul!!! I feel like you'd find some great stuff and it would be better quality than wish😂
I loved the hollister look so much, like the jacket yes please
That Zara outfit looked so good on you 😍
11:43 don't make me dance. don't make me do it. 😂
This video was so unique, love it!!! The Francesca's was the nicest.
I absolutely love those pants from urban outfitters and can’t find them online in Australia. Pleaseee help me find them!! Xx
Please wear clothes from the men section for a week!
It would be cool if you did this for every season!
I actuall love the top shop one.
We don't have H&M in the Netherlands anymore (EDIT: we do I bet it was another store that sounded like it that went failliet)
I love how the top shop mannequin resembles Zoella considering she shops there a lot.
I would actually love to wear the first and last outfits I love them.
2:56 Miranda sings going to a formal party
Do I dressed scene for a week
Hahaha you are the best. 💖
Love this idea and the guy in the pink sweater was funny. Is he your boyfriend/husband? (First video I've seen of yours) thx!
so glad u leaved buzzfeed, i only watched it bc you
WHERE DOES SHE GET ALL THESE AMAZING IDEAS FROM?!
you honestly looked pretty stylish in this video
Never bend your knees while walking in high heels- just a friendly advice. My mother actually made me walking back and forth with books on my head before she allowed me to leave the house in high heels. Tough love, but it sure worked :)
I really like the first, fourth, sixth and last outfit a lot. I would definitely wear the fourth and sixth one out and about. BTW Safiya you make great videos and I enjoy each one. xo, Rose
I love the glasses! You should wear them even more!!!
i honestly love all of saf's videos becuase their so unique and fun. when she made the i ordered the first 5 things from - series, i thought it would end but she kept finding new places to buy from. all these shopping challenges are so fun !! love you saf (and tyler haha) xo
Please make part 2 of this video. I looove ir
BUT THAT LAST OUTFIT IS FERB HIS STYLE RIGHT
Anyone else see the H&M mannequin in the UK?? they reeeeaaaaaalllly want to sell that outfit
I would actually wear the franchescas outfit it's pretty cute
why would they use another stores socks on their mannequin what
I’m gonna start dressing like mannequins cause these clothes are fire
Yo some of these outfits are actually cute af and I wish most of these stores were in Australia ;o;
i actually love the forever 21 & topshop entire outfit...
she's so pretty!!! WHY IS SHE SO PRETTY???/ NO MATTER WHAT SHE WEARS SHE LOOKS AMAZING!!!
I wish she put the prices :((
i would have worn the f21 outfit but then again that’s the only place i shoP
I work for Zara and the outfit is TRF which is there younger / teenage line, just saying 🙈
ok but i actually love the zara outfit
She looked good in EVERYTHING!!!! how !!???
The hat on the first oufit it looked like a bts cap *- but it's not :(
I wish zara had cute clothes like that outfit Its dramatic I Love you
@Safiya Nygaard Hey!!! I just love you girl!!! Your videos are awesome and I've saved most of them in my mobile... I keep watching them again and again!! And I've a couple of suggestions for u\n1. Fenty Beauty foundation vs the custom foundation which u ordered!\n2. Fenty Beauty vs Frankendation (the one which u made using different foundations)\n3. Only Fenty Beauty for a week - Foundation, Killawatt Highlighter and Gloss Bomb!!\nPlease please please 😍 I know you are super busy... But will love a reply from u😘 Love from India
Did anyone else think she was going to pretend to be a mannequin for a week... no just me ok bye
Woah your makeup was on point in this video!!!!
whenever saf is speaking i can't take my eyes of her winged eyeliner! its so damn perfect!
I came into this thinking all the outfits were gonna be completely ridiculous but I actually really like those pyjama pants. They really go with my  40s and 50s aesthetic
Awesome video idea! Also interesting to see how mannequins are styled in different countries :)
I loved the Top Shop outfit on you! You looked like someone from That 70s Show! This was sucha fun idea! Please do it again!
I loved this video! You keep coming up with such creative videos, keep up the work! 🙈❤️
As a Visual Merchandiser for H&M, all the stuff that is put on the mannequins is right behind them. When you first walk into the store, the A areas are what you first see and those areas of the store contain the mannequins
Do you keep all these clothes after???
they looked so good on you omg!!
I love how creative safiya is! Who else would even come up with this idea , and she deserves all the success she gets!
Legitimately saw that outfit with the pink cardigan at the mall, walked in to check the price, annnnnd went to old navy because your girl isn't spending $40 on one cardigan💅🏻
5:40 anyone else see the men watching her. (Not asking for likes)
Visual merchandising is the one responsible for the outfits and styling most of the time. Depending on the store we either follow a guide that shows us how to style and it's either followed to the T or we just use it as a guide and style to how we like it
I really like the Zara outfit.
You rocked the last one holy shit, Safiya- future hipster confirmed?
That West side story reference!😂
Omg get it!!!! that Zara outfit is fucking gold on you!
The reason all the mannequin outfits are not front & centre in the store is because they're already heavily promoted by being in the window. As shown in the video people are more likely to ask where that jacket in the window is. So we might as well promote some other stuff, so the hope is as u walk in the store looking for the jacket, u will see other stuff u like and buy that too ;)
Okay but did she walk past loose change
Loved the video! Now I want to go shopping 😂💜
i like the zara outfit best
Everyone’s loving the Zara outfit and I’m just here getting my debit card out on the urban outfitters website
Maybe the 70's look was the pants
I love the hollister the most
the last one is like straight from the 70s
The Hollister outfit is like an outfit from Clueless!
Saf and Tyler r like basically the same ethnicity.. Half-White and Half- Asian
Saf's closet must be CRAMPED from all these shopping videos! 😆
The way u realise that safiya left buzzfeed is that she actually did 1 week
You should dress as Good Will Mannequins for a week. XD
Do a male version of dressing like a mannequin!
oMG THAT ZARA ONEEEE
You’re slayiinnnnn the topshop outfit!
The kpop hat though :D
Why is this talentless whore trending
Safiya stop promoting fast fashion!!!!!!
i love you

I love hotdog yes teach us how to make home made hotdogs
Weird i never get these videos in my sub-box anymore

Yo thought it was jp but julia came through in the clutch as always lol
jp's was way cooler. Plus he's not a party pooper, hes a party starter!
Eh Julia won this one in like 2mins
1:52 The hot dog is thick girl uuhh
You know, there was a time when I would probably have choked to death on that.\nNow..naw.. I lost 327lbs without surgery! I want to live and eating this speeds up the inevitable.

Her videos aren't even funny anymore.
This is like a five year old wanted to make a YouTube video
Amy Schumer is funnier then you atleast I don't chronic depression from from her jokes
Don't let her mediocre acting and shoulder-shrugging script distract you from the fact that she is promoting Academic Dishonesty
I liked the skit. Didn’t make me laugh tho, acting is always over the top. I literally didn’t even smile watching this
*What is the song played at the end?*\nedit: Anyone?...
This is so horrible it's not funny

THIS IS REAL MUSIC!!!!
So disapointed, typical pop trash. They used to be on such a unique level then they come out with this
I cant believe how far these guys have come. I remember being in high school listening to them when the musiv videos were filmed on an iphone. Now look at these lot.
that darkskin girl is fine as fuck!!!!
This is wavy like konan's waves
This is fucking washed.  Krept has always been some butters talentless mutant.. and as for Konan..\n\nThese 2 must have been smoking some high grade when they made this dead tune.  \n\nIt goes absolutely nowhere.
Islamic terrorism is a false flag operation
But my desire to hear the end of this story is so strong.
My knees make the same sound.
I still don't get why this guy has so many views. This shit is boring af and not really entertaining.
Wow man, I've got a new level of respect for you now. Hiking is good too, hope you got some of that in Colorado!
Why do you have a channel?
Ur rich enough to buy a new one
Stop stressing about it Casey you will run again people break their backs and necks and run again don't listen to Doctors they always say that shit!
Love you man ! Keep it positive, whatever happens 🏃
Your only 36... I honestly thought you were late 50’s.
you fly more then you run casey
What's the last song's Name!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow your knee sounds exactly what mine sounds like right now
Had problems with my meniscus in my knee and had to give up my beloved running. I've replaced it with swimming. Not quite as good, but pretty good.
My hopes n prayers with you
What’s the name of that kanye song
Casey god is good bro you will keep running 🏃 just stay positive no matter what
11 months ago I was Downhill longboarding and road vibrations (not Speed wobbles) threw me off my board and I jammed my leg around 35 mph which instantly dislocated my knee joint and shattered my tibia inside the bottom part of my knee joint....... worst part was the stretched nerve used to lift my foot. Took me over 6 months to actually lift my foot correctly and start walking right again......
New flash running to much is very bad for your Knees and by the time you get to my age 52 they will be done.\nSlow down please
my question is how did he get a kanye west song on a youtube video?
I PREFER THE VIDEOS WITH COMPILATIONS ALL THE CAMERA CRASHES ALL THE WORKOUTS ALL THE GIGI NEISTAT\nALL THE OSCAR BOYSONS ETCS. BUT WHY SOME PEOPLE COMMENT THAT THE KNEE IT GO: CRAC DECRAC CRAC DE BOP BOP TE BAP? \nWHY DE PEOPLE SAY: GO CASEYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Having to wait for another video has pissed me off. Now you'll find out and do another weeks worth of editing ZzZzZz\n\nI hope everything is fine for you though. Much respect to you
Casey I think you should download this app called sweat coin. You earn money if you run and you can get vouchers and all sorts!
There's a part in the movie peaceful warrior that almost the same as this video but different
Casey hope you make an update to the check up 🤔😓😐
please help me to 200 subs guys (next shout out if you comment on my video too)
Ok it was a good video I liked it, but like the title is super clickbaity
Hey man! I totally feel ya i've been running for a while aswell and my left knee fucked up so i gave running a rest and knee healed after many many months later. \nWent to a gym a day and fucked my right knee from leg training now. Still hurts now and then fml.. pains goes and comes so sometimes i can run and dash without problems other times it hurts :(
What happens is Life. It turns and turns and turns again. Nothing can be so predictable, especially something as fragile as human flesh. And if you deny the fact especially after you've enjoyed multitudes and multitudes of aspects of such a fragile thing and it's removed, yet your continuously bound to it, then your perspective of the gift itself was misconstrued to begin with. It remind me of the movie with Jim Carrey, you know the one where he's been filmed since birth and doesn't know it, and the whole town is actors? Well anyway, everyone all over the world watched it for years and years, totally engrossed, no matter what. And at the very end when the finale came, boom, the station just went off. Remember what the world started to do? They all changed, and never looked back.
Another excuse by jon snow for not bending the knee
I've been diagnosed with Ankylosing spondylitis at 19, among many other diseases and bull. No high impact exercise for me
And you can't spell I correctly again.
research on it. fix your leg man. purring of cat can strengthen bones . research about frequencies . healing frequencies and nutrition and theraphy . we love you man. you will get better again .
Hope you go see 2/3 specialists. And glad you did ignore the fact that you weren't going to run anymore and obviously have and a TON.
.....last time I ran was looong ago because I had to for middle school lol
How to tell if you're privileged find to complain about something that although might be a serious / big deal, but blow it out of proportion just for the views
Holy crap i thought you were paralyzed from the waste down thanks to the thumbnail and title. I thought you were in some sort of crazy accident. But no. Clickbaiting this sort of thing is not cool
All the dangerous things he mentioned/showed are barley dangerous if at all.
Ive had runners knee for about a year and a half. Is that bad?
Everyone know that road running causes your joint to essentially fall apart...
I have the same condition and had to stop running. My knees sound the same. It sucks but running that much is definitely not good for! Cycling is good though! You'll live Casey :)
When I used to run damn it was addictive I loved it.
I run away from running - Lixi
Casey you should try out cycling. It's way easier on the joints
wishing you the best, try swimming or cycling
Casey Niestat IF YOUR READING THIS  your going to have to take some flexibly pills well at least to make to not fell that much pain ; but I have been though 8 surgery or more, tell you by phone chat or Skype, keep in touch but man and wish the best of luck hopefully you can get surgery or medical pills to help growth back some of that flexibly :)
No wonder he always uses that skim board
Meh, can't feel bad for this guy. Wanna take a risk? Try sitting down.
Damn that sounds terrible\nHopefully is something that can be resolved, I can cleayvsee that you have a passion for running\nAnd I can sorta relate to how that would suck if you can't run, is like if I break the hand I use to play guitar with, I wouldn't know what to do with myself
Casey the same thing happened to my Leg I hope you fell better I'm praying for you
Time to get those kangaroo legs like Oscar Pistorious
If you can't keep running then, JUST KEEP SWIMMING JUST KEEP SWIMMING! Ellen Degenerous is a good guy. I know she's a woman lel
you put to many miles on ur legs bro
Roses are red, Tomatoes are too , I just got clickbaited , and so did you
All a sudden everyone in the comment has a doctor degree
Start Swimming ... lol or biking, but i feel ur pain . Its not the end though theres always alternatives. And if you do decide to toughen it out , be considerate. It's your body , listen to it .
hey man, I hope that you can or being able to run again .... but maybe is time to reduce your distances ... it is good to run, I like to, but  I did it just once a day and for 30 or 45 minutes.... be positive as always you are ... I hope for the good news for you and your knees.... greetings from Mexico.
Not good to run on concrete, get a treadmill bro.
I thought you quit youtube
Casey, I hope you will listen to me.  Start eating tons of Turmeric in everything you eat and make sure you add a pinch of black pepper to it.  And I dont mean cooking with it.  I am talking 3 to 4 table spoonfuls.  This rebuilt my very painful, surgeon molested, knee...against all odds!!\nStart drinking distilled water; 1 gallon/day with 4oz of freshly squeezed lemon and 2oz of organic ACV.  No more water of any sort, only distilled to remove the build up inside your joints and your body.  The body can be 100% rebuilt and every disease 100% cured, including viruses.  \nCut anything that can cause inflammation; all oils, except butter.  Totally cut gluten!  Eat soft and running eggs; 8-9 daily.  Try this for 2 weeks minimum and witness miracles!  I was in tears realizing all my joints got rebuilt.  I implore you try this. \nAlso lookup detoxification with food-grade peroxide.  You will get you health and your active life back...\nAlso, running is not good for anyone, any doctor will tell you that.  Try jump rope or a trampoline.  Why not take on rollerblading?\nWhich athlete do you know who can walk normally once they mature in years?  Running is really not good for you especially in this society where food is poison.  Good luck to you!!
What’s the song from 4min to 5min
Fuck I hate this guy...
I'm so fucking sick of running addicts acting like their addiction is stylish, healthy and cool. The human body was not built for daily long-span running on hard ground, running the way it's being made fashionable is actually BAD for you. Stop endorsing it like it's not! You are literally an adrenaline junkie hipster slowly destroying your joints and being sad that you're not superhuman enough to resist the absolutely inevitable. Stop promoting excessive running like it's not a bad thing!
I'm in my mid 20's and I tried 6 a day but I'm 6'5 220+ and my knees were letting me know 3 weeks in that that was too much stress. I comfortably run 3 but I'll add two days where I'll go 6 a week. Maybe you don't have to stop running just moderate how much per day. A dozen would be murder on my knees.
Wow Casey, that sound of your knee. Hope the MRI has a positive outcome.  Fingers crossed for you man   🤞
I hate you so i'm glad you're a cripple
But what are you running from?
Have you tried turning the leg off and on again?
HELLLPPP i need the the name of the track in credits!!!
Good luck Casey And We Will Say Prayers XX
You always looked like a vegetable
This is a story I never ever wanted to hear
Omg hopefully u get better and keep running, trust me not being able to run is the worst thing ever, ik this because in one of my soccer games a kid broke my leg and since then i havent been able to run at all and its just so bad. Like running and doing sports for me was everything. Sometimes i get depressed but i just hope for the best. Im still thankful for everything I have. Always Thank God.
Aw nuts

Hey guys! There's a little corolla easter egg somewhere in here, so hopefully I didn't make it too obvious! Also like I stated in the video, I live in Texas and I personally know people who have been affected by Hurricane Harvey. This means a lot to me, so if you want to help out with relief efforts here, in Puerto Rico or in Florida (or anywhere else) consider downloading Tab For a Cause completely for free; http://tab.gladly.io/r/reallifelore. You guys are always amazing :)
And, why do ppl still live in places that are likely to be hit by hurricanes?
Yeah but my school does let me download anything!!!!
well just simply drop 2 tsars into it, simple
Mankind now builds LNG ships. They are designed to refrigerate and transport Liquified Natural Gas. I've been wondering for some time what would happen if a vessel was built to carry Liquid Nitrogen which is now produced and used in Farming. Liquid Nitrogen is -289 degrees F and non toxic, about 78% of our atmosphere. I wonder what would happen if the full cargo of such a ship were discharged in the eye of a Hurricane. It would create tremendous pressure as it returned to a gas plus it would crash the temperature. Would be interesting to see how much was required. The place to hit a Hurricane would be off the coast of Africa while it was still forming. The downside is that it might be that the Earth needs these storms and there might be some disastrous effect if we didn't have them. Still, they do a lot of damage and preventing them might be worth the research and development of such a system if it could work.
As they say a man with a hammer sees every problem as a nail.
Solution: *Declare war on hurricane *
Came here from 9gag, who else?
Well i bet an air bender can stop it
a really american solution to a problem. Is something wrong? Bomb it!
Now they’re asking the real questions
The north korea's nuke can do it\n\n\n\n\nAlso isis ALLAHU AKBAR!!!!!
What Happens If You Drop a Nuclear Bomb Into a volcano?
well now she know why Kim Hong un was launching missiles at irma
Just what would it be worth in value if a company could be able to stop any tornado or hurricane?  Am only 19 million dollars now from that answer. A man once said a few centuries back, People will someday be able to talk to someone all the way across the country by wires. People just laughed.
Jesus can stop hurricanes may sound funny but it's true
This is why you live in Minnesota.
What if all Toyota Corollas went extinct?
How the hell did people actually think this'd work to begin with?
*nukes hurricane* shit now we have a radioactive hurricane
Why does this guy sound like Stephen Hawking
Jesus what kind of idiot decided that throwing a nuclear bomb into a hurricane was a good idea? Of course it will do nothing! and the raidation left over would do even more damage 😂
Hurricanes are awesome. Why would anyone want to destroy one?\n\n🤷‍♂️
Just make another hurricane going the opposite direction and fight em like beyblades
Why won't idea 3 work?
the title is a great fucking question
Id rather have everybody in Florida and Texas die then a part of the oceans die.
0:51 the sheer amount of power the toyota corollas have is amazing, dropping one into a hurricane will make them dissapear immediately. why hasn't anyone done this yet?
So basically destroying a Hurricane is like killing a spider in your house, you have to destroy everything else in the process
Very interesting video. I hope you and your loved ones are doing well.
The best way to stop a hurricane:\n\nPrevent it from starting in the first place.\n\nThey start when the warm air from the Sahara desert meets the cool air from the south of africa.... why don't we somehow try to redirect or block the air from blowing towards the ocean
How many nuke explosions in the same place would it take for Earth to be thrown out of orbit?
What if you bitch slap the hurricane somewhere else ?
So, just a critique... You don't have to equate the required amount of energy from hydrogen bombs to the amount of energy found within a hurricane. You would only need to detonate a blast large enough to dispel the hurricane just enough to spread into smaller storms more similar to those we experience on a daily basis. You do not need to entirely erase the hurricane. That is overkill if I've ever heard of it.\n\nThat said, this conceptual calculation is difficult.
I'm not doing that tab for a cost......\n\n\n             cuz I was in the hurricane
What about HAARP? Can it stop or change the path of a hurcain?
Bro this hurricane sucks. I wish we could just nuke it outta here.
Wait...\n\n\n\n\n*What if we weaponize hurricanes then?* :D
What would happen if multiple nuclear bombs were set off over Yellowstone..? Should do a vid on that .
To answer your question EVEN MORE destructive
The cost of construction of even one downdraft solar tower is around 2 Billion dollars, which is probably why these were never constructed. But taking into account the damages caused by Hurricanes this year alone, 2 Billion dollars suddenly don't look that much.
Guys, it's so simple. Just fucking Deport it! It's entering the country illegally anyway!
Dry Ice is the key
This is the sharknado 1 plot
Never even think of doing this.... Nature is always ahead of us😎 Respect Nature🙏
I think the bombing location is critical in this theory.  The center of a hurricane may NOT be the best place to detonate the bomb. \n At least numerous simulation runs can be done now to verify this theory and figure out the near-optimal bombing location and TNT power to disable each specific hurricane.
The radiation would mutate the hurricane and turn it into a cat 10
I gotta redeem!\nI gotta relieve!\nI gotta receive!\nI gotta Believe!\n\nBOMB IS THE MOST DEADLY
hurricanes have energy? hurricanes must be oil!!!!
That app helps humanity to get rid of feminists and all liberal scum?
Don’t forget Carla tho that storm was fucking expensive if the estimated cost are to be believed it would be close to a trillion dollars in damage but since we don’t have accurate records of all of the destruction who knows
Stupid idea from stupid people. You cant beat natures power.
I hear that Donald Trump thinks it might work.
It would spread radioactive isotopes all over the planet
Yeah. Let's not ever do that.
This is what I like to watch at 1 am.
Imagine what would happen if Reed and the CSA encountered a hurricane.
Good thing there are limits on the NON MILITARY MEGATON NUCLEAR WEAPONS........WTF!!!
Well, think first on not creating them.
dropping toyotas into a hurricane would distribute toyota parts over an impressive amount of ocean.
I got the Easter egg the eye of the storm i dont know witch movie sense there's lots of tornado of movies
Couldn't neutron activation of some of the pollutants in the rain water from a hurricane cause all sorts of nasty fallout, even worse than just the fallout from the bomb itself?
Sees a problem:  Let's nuke it.  The Murika's way
This is dumb. Who would even ask this???
1. Freeze them\n2. Use a giant funnel\n3. *Drop x Toyota Corollas*\n4. Shine *lazars* at them\n5. Bomb them with nukes
Put some eye drops in the eye. Lol
Nuking a hurricane may sound extremely badass but considering deadly radioactive particles, it would more likely be like thorwing shit at a fan
In the eye of a hurricane the-  oh shit a fucking nuke I'm out
Save yourself 5 minutes, the answer is no
or maybe we could  ... prevent it by reducing Co²-emission and climate change ... but wait, that would be too easy
Why not get a huge vacuum cleaner and suck up the hurricane
I had this thought for so long and now I get this recommended lol
Dab For A Cause, help spread the cancer

Does anyone think Ben has multiple accounts that he just leaves hate comments on this channel?
Which was the first vid of Christine all u guys saw first
I dare u to pin This comment!
Who are the Dolan twins? Are they the next Smosh? Or the next Dan and Phil? Are they comedic or vloggers? When you hit past 24 you generally stop caring about up and coming youtubers that are younger than yourself. Not always, but most of the time.\n\nAlso, guys, chill. Cristine is not in the target age group for their content. People have different tastes.
I remember when she did nail art videos..
Ok but why is cristine throwing shade at Shane?
And all 9 feet of Superwoman's hair\nTHIS KILLED ME WHAT IS MY LIFE
WHY THE EFF DID PATRICK STAR WIN CRISTINE IS WAY MORE BEAUTIFUL LIKE IF YOU AGREE
God, Patrick Starrrrrrrrrrrr is the most boring Youtube presence ever, even for the beauty community... -_-

sCREAMING FOR MYKIE AT THE END SO FUCKING EXCITED I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLLABORATION SINCE THE CANDY CANE QUEEN NAILS AHHHHHHHH

*Puts the WDW boys on my finger nails so I can stare at them all day*
Okay I'm 15 and 10 years old need to hop off go play with some barbies, because they are the reason why the dolan twins can't do anything in there age range
Cristine ur the only reason I  dont  have friends
Why didn't you put a holo glossy taco on 'em? That's so sad... the Dolan twins would look so good in holo💿💕💕💕
Am I the only one who thought of “Who's It Gonna Be“ by BgA when she said “Who’s it gonna be??
You are so annoying. I used to like you, but now... I dont really like you.
time to put pepe and melanie martinez on my nails
Could you please do the aquarium nailsss
Are you going to try the tres she talons press on holo nails? 😱
When Cristine so rarely does nail tutorials that I genuinely thought the beginning of the tutorial was another YouTube ad
Peel porn is awesome.  Now I can tell everyone that I do porn... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou clicked read more didn't u? Lol

FINALLY, a trending video without Ben 😂😂

I'm sorry, is it terrible that all through your dialogue that I just watched Menchi's antics behind you? You need to put pictures of her and Zyler (sp??) on your nails! Yes! That's the answer!
Look at the link because they are press on holo nails https://youtu.be/hEOscLWCGcA Maybe you can try?
Have you ever done a nail tutorial with the bits from the peel bag?
You dont need the makeup of the nail stuff. Your sarcasm is your charisma, and your beauty.
Dude. Did you get a new camera? Or is it my new kickass phone?
My cat died 15th of September
7:47 she started playing that music and I had a mini heart attack because I was playing a game and thought I was about to fight a boss 😂😅

Bubz... XD Such honesty is remarkable.
I am so glad you are okay...I was in an accident once, wasn't even hurt, and I cried...
And people went off at Tim for not being willing to oil your perineum.... but this was true love!!! No longer can YouTube comments say he doesn't love you and isn't a great husband!!
so excited for this channel to reach 1 million <3
You're so real I love it 😂 x
i read isaac's shirt wrong :) i thought it said 'my mummy is chaotic' but it says 'my mummy is magic'
Your fine the way you are!! Your beautiful. Dont let others get you down
Does anyone know whether there is an issue with the weight of Ayla? She seems hugely puffy. Is that normal or was that addressed in a prior vlog?
Hi bubz I'm from hong kong😀❤
Watching your vlogs makes me miss hong kong even more, especially bc you live in the same area 😭😭😭
Bubz, just to make you feel better... it happened to me as well and i`m 27! I was walking from point A to point B for 20 minutes and was dying to go to the toilet but couldn't find one. You`ll be fine ;)
Awww bubz!  Everyone has sh*t themselves once or twice.  Usually its a mistaken fart!  😂😂😂😂😂
Don't worry about it bubz, it's actually more common than you think. Once your pelvic muscles have recovered and strengthened it will be fine. Also I know what you mean about the culture difference. In Uganda relatives will be very direct and outspoken on things like weight (but then expect you to eat a lot too haha)
So I'm flying to Hong Kong tomorrow ahaha ummm
Why you need to go to HK this often?
Lol was walking with my grandma the other day and she goes time to lose weight and I went me or you?  (jokingly) and she replies obv not me. Im already skinny enough 😂😂 gotta love Chinese folks
Try a comotomo bottle. That’s what I used when I was breastfeeding my son and would feed him expressed milk. It’s large and kind of mimics the breast. It also has a silicone body so who ever is feeding baby can gently squeeze it and it will mimic milk let down.\n\nI got mine on amazon. Here is a link. \n\nComotomo Natural Feel Baby Bottle, Pink, 5 Ounces https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004C053B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3yj0zbXFJ75WW
Ohh been there your not the only one
It's so nostalgic seeing you guys in your old apartment. And no worries Lindy! We all have moments when we can't control our bowels. I often climb at a rock climbing gym, and one time while climbing at the gym, i tried so hard at a climb that I let one rip... In front of a lot of people. LOL.
what better way to say it than sh*t happens lol its ok Bubz
Bubz your so real and I love You! I appreciate your authenticity so much and you always make me feel so much better after I watch your vids. Thank you!!!!!  : ) ♡♡♡
Ayla has the same arm rolls as Isaac when he was a baby...so cute!!
Aww it's okay Lindy, I had a fecal accident once too. I had a horrible stomach flu and it just happened... In my ex in laws house... It got all over the bathroom floor... It was awful 😑
lol that reminds me of Charlottes accident in the Sex in the City Movie hahahahahaha
Better having the accident in the car rather than spilling as you walk past the security man ^_^.
Bubz I love how open and honest you are. Lol it happens to everyone we’re human. It’s normal haha🤷🏾‍♀️
It’s an Asian thing to be chunky lol
that was the same place where Isaac had his first taste of apple juice and had that sugar rush
Don't worry, Bubz, you are not alone! I drank soo much water in a marathon last year and the traffic when I was getting home was just SO SLOW  that I basically peed myself in the elevator going back home. Me, a healthy 21 years old woman. Believe me, you will laugh like crazy about this in the future (or at least Tim will, I know my bf does).
Aww don’t worry my mom did that twice
its okay we have all been there
his talking has progressed so much!! hope you're less worried now bubz
awww! I've missed your vlogs at your Hong Kong apartment!!
It's ok Bubz. My husband tried to fart one night and ended up crapping himself too.
Idk why, but I miss you guys living in Hong Kong!
I've had this experience before, and it's terrible. I think you should have just stopped at the nearest restroom instead of trying to drive all the way to the hotel. If we had tried to make it to our hotel, we wouldn't have made it,  but luckily we stopped by the first restaurant on our way to use the restroom.
Korean people are the same lmao. When I visited my family in Korea my great aunt was like, You gained SOOOOOO much weight when it was the end of the trip. I'm in Korea, lady! I'm gonna eat everything!! xD
I did crap myself too lol back then when i had gastroenteritis. Thankfully i was at home for 3 straight days 😂
bubz dont feel bad.. i am 23 and have IBS.. so i have had many close calls were i had to rush to the bathroom .. its embarrassing yes i know but dont feel do badly .. a lot of people have that happen to them .
Don't worry Bubs I've been in the same situation except I was on the toilet but on the edge of the seat and yeap missed the bowl...got everywhere. I was recovering from knee surgery so had a full leg brace on but still. Needed a good shower after that lol. Plus my partner had to help....yeap    that was prob my rock bottom but hey many years later and we are still together :) thats true love right there. Your not alone! Shit litterally happens lol
I remember your videos before Isaac and the things you have had to overcome. I see you with your lovely family now, and I'm so so happy for you bubz :) long time subzy here, much love!
Aww brought back so many memories seeing your Hong Kong kitchen!!!!!!!!!!! :)
I love that your, crapped your pants, video is trending.
Bubz! When you said life happens, all I thought about was how you could have said... sh*t happens hahahahah why am I like this
Oh my gosh yes.. my husband is Chinese. His grandma came to visit right after I had my daughter and she asked if I was pregnant again. I cried so hard 😭 what a blow to someone's self esteem! Must be a Chinese thing.
maybe I’ve missed something, but I haven’t seen Chubbi in a while
Isaac is such a polite little guy!
awwwww I haven't watched bubz in a Long time and was so happy to see Isaac became so polite and adorable I LOVE THE BUBZ FAM
You are beautiful just the way you are
I guess you could say\nA *shitty* thing happened\n\n🌚
Hahahahahaha oh no bubz. So unfortunate but... You are not alone AND you pushed two beautiful babies out of you so its explainable haha and omg my pacific island family is way more harsher than the average p.i family haha it starts from when they see you in the drive hahaha
All the nostalgic feels seeing the HK apartment ☺️
Not click bait I knew Bubz wouldn't do that. I've been so close to shitting myself before so I know how terrifying it is! But then again I threw up on the first week of secondary school in the classroom... on my uniform skirt so my embarrassment threshold hold is pretty high.
When you get really worried but then you remember it's Bubz and her family. Sorry for your accident though xD I miss hearing TVB in the background sigh- even when my own parents.
I can relate, my mom tells me I'm fat then she just keeps feeding me. You're very brave to take what Tim's grandmother said and make it a joke. I think I would have cried from being offended.
She looks so much like her brother, it's uncanny. I thought I'd clicked on an old video by mistake.
I'm not even Asian but one of my close friends who is from Shanghai saw me 10 weeks after giving birth, and immediately (after greetings and hugs etc) grabbed onto some side fat from my arm and yelled what's up with this flab?!. It was hilarious, at first I was like I JUST had a baby, what's up with YOU?! and he was like uh... yeah, I guess you did! lol. Then I relaxed bc I remembered it's normal for his culture/family, and he also apologized for being so forward!
Omg I almost peed myself while you were telling us the story.... I'm so sorry, but ty for sharing.....LOL sh*t does happen!!!!!! P.S. happened to me when I was 14 and very sick and will never forget that fateful day
Isaac looks just like a baby Tim
love all of you and so happy that your family is well but I miss seeing the dogs in the vlogs! <3
yay! she is in hong kong again \ni loveeeee watching her vlogs when she is in hk because i love the smile on her face and moreover i an too in hk so its cool to see my hometown to be vlogged by a beautiful and talented youtuber
😂😂😂 definitely a milestone!!! I've been on the verge before so it's bound to happen 😂 also Hispanics tend to be the same specifically the older generations 😅
Hey Bubzcribers,\nPlease consider helping out one of your fellow Bubz club members! :):)\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/mytuitionmission\nI'm on a mission to finish my Master's degree!!! Any help is highly appreciated!
<3
Sending love ❤️
Ohh dear 😂😂😂 poor Bubz xx
Grandmas are adorable☺️
The phone advert is lombard direct...my surname!!
please feel free to visit my channel ❤❤❤\nsub to sub, comment if your done 😊😊😊
I'm chinese and grew up with all irish friends so when every time I go home to visit my parents tell me I'm really fat and I tell them to piss off. They need to get used to the Irish culture too 😂
56 billion animals are tortured raped and slaughtered every year please leave animals off your plate go vegan
Are you freezing then defrosting the milk? Sometimes you have to scold the milk before freezing so it keeps that sweet taste like fresh breastmilk has
I love that you share everything. You are so real and fun.
I think when old people see that you've gained weight they look at you as being healthier, so it's definitely not a bad thing! :)
It happens to the best of us😂🙈
Bubz I totally feel you. I feel like asians are just like that. When it comes to weight they prefer the lean look. They don't care about your feelings, which is rude but screw them. You and Ayla are happy and healthy, that's all that matters. Everyone still comments on how big my pregnant tummy was and how fat my face was getting. Even with my current pregnancy all I hear is, wow your baby is going to be 10 pounds! Like rude much? But idc because after I had my child and probably this one too, I was an absolute twig. Everyone then decided to get in my face and ask how I lost the weight and compliment how pretty I was now. Like was I ugly while pregnant and before that too? I felt horrible either way. Being chunky or not, we will still get judged. Love you bubz, stay strong. You're a beautiful mommy.
I got the, you're getting so fat! no wonder you cant find a husband!\n😲
this video is #11 on trending right now.. as if the situation couldn't be worse, even MORE people will see it 😂 so nice seeing you back in the HK apartment, what a throwback!! it's exactly the same even after all these years ❤
Bubz, I think you should make a new intro now 👀
I swear you are the only person I can think of who looks so hot while talking about 'fecal accidents'
you are so beautiful! Even if you did poop yourself :P
I love you bubz! Ur so great with ur big kind personality and ur family!
THIS IS WHY WE LOVE YOU! 😂❤️
Welcome to the club, Ive been there before.
I feel so bad
Will Isaac go to school in Hong Kong or Ireland?
I laughed so much that I popped myself too. LOL. I love you, but this actually happens, it's normal, awkward, unfunny are the moment but then it, it's a hell of a laugh.
what an ugly baby,the Midwife slapped the wrong person.
this one year i went to vietnam (born and raise in the states mind you) for chinese new year and like in the middle of the night we went to a temple to pray. i had the most ugliest stomachache and had to leave in the middle to go home. luckily the temple and the house was about 3-5 minutes walk. i seriously thought i was gonna crap myself. \n\ni seriously think when you go to a different country, something about the food makes you sick? like something about it doesn't sit well with your stomach. XD i think it's normal
Bubz you pushed a baby out of you! I think you are doing juuuust fine.. <3
Oh Isaac ur a good boy!\nMel avelino here from Philippines always watching ur   vlog
OMG Bubz I feel so bad for you.. I had the same accident too a few years ago (I was 25) and got really sick, puking and diarrhea all at the same time.. I felt so awful and had so scrub the bathroom rug afterwards
THAT CLICK BAIT THOUGH. I thought something serious happened and was worried for a second. People shit their pants all the time. You have that to look forward to when youre elderly. Also you look great bubz don't even worry about the weight. Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes and I've never thought less of someone for putting on weight.
I missed HK vlogs
11 on trending 🎉🎉
lol shit happens XD
Ayla reminds me of granny bubz!
ayla looks like the baby boh from spirited away LOL ahahah
OMG the kitchen!!! the memories!!!
Omg bubz you lost alot of weight!😍

This is not a life hack!! It's a recipe!!
Recipes always have that thing that you dont have...
His making apples look delicious 😋😋
Good idea. Love the presentation potential. I think I'll try separating the topping, filling, and apple bowl. Trick is to cook the apple bowl so it's not as firm, yet still durable enough for the filling so it doesn't sag. I'd cook the cooking separately. The topping possibly could be done last and broiled in the oven once all put together. I'll have to play around with the presentation, but I love the concept.
Pie cause I'm American
He revealed his face
You don't need an apple tree  to make this
Please make a video on FACE CAM !
Apples are so sweet theres NO need to add sugar
My neighbour has an apple tree but he’s a stingy mofo
So now it's a cooking channel?

BEST RIRI SONG EVER?? Mine is We Found LOVE...\n\nLETS START A THREAD....
I AM SHOOK SUISBDEH I THOUGHT THAT WAS RIH
patrick you are so funny in the video i was shook went i found out that was not rihanna but love it excellent work and i am a middle child is the best love you
This is crazy I actually rewind this video like 10x just to figure out the difference between her and Rihanna and I can’t  find one flaw they look identical like WTF. Cool makeup tutorial tho.
she doesnt look like rihanna at all lol!
OMG I LOVE ZOOM! that was my shit!
She looks like rihanna but she doesn't like straight outta madam tussauds where they kinda nail it but not quite you know what I'm getting at..
I legit thought this was riri until she smiled i could tell it was different but still very beautiful
i saw the thumbnail and thought you were filming with rihanna herself and i almost died on the spot. that girl is gorgeous though, and her makeup looks hella good baby <3
Love the vid...I sure do remember watching Zoom as a child
Oldest here! Zoom was one of my favorite shows.
I thought it was Rihanna in the thumbnail. Amazing!
She looks exactly like Rihanna ! The model is beyond gorgeous The only feature she doesn't have of Rih's is her lips . Rih has a heart shaped Cupid's bow
The middle child club tho lol 😂😂 \n\nWe know the real problems 😂😂
she looks loke one of those barbie dress up heads without any makeup.
Babe, please do more Rihanna looks with Andele, like her yellow look!\nSalamat! :*
yes I love Rihanna she's a queen
Holy shit I thought she was Rihanna. what the f*ck!
zoom was the shit!!!
Wooooowww, you did such a fabulous job!!! She look exactly like bad gal riri 😍😍😍
I'm the youngest
I've been watching a lot of the reviews and I would love to try these! You are so talented, she looks amazing! (Although she looks amazing with and without makeup) 😍💜
Am I the only one that thought that was Riri😅
OK IS THAT HER REAL EYE COLOR CUZ DAMN SHE IS SO GORGEOUS
Not gunna lie I actually thought that Rihanna during the intro😂😂
She doesn't look like riri just a little but not like her. But I love the make up look
My dumbass took a while to realize that isn’t Rihanna..
Aww your model is just beautiful! 💜
Oh my goodness I loved Zoom and then one day it was gone.
clown..eek she so full of herself too.
who else thought Patrick was doing Rihannas makeup XD
the only reason i realized this wasnt rihanna was because of the comments and her voice
OMG I thought that was actually Rihanna like if you agree
Shook because I thought it was Rihanna
Oh hell naw I thought she was actually Rihanna 🙄
Whoever wants the song: Call me again by NCS.

Song?
Trendinggg BOYZZZ
Start playing FIFA 18
Your hair is still nice
ONLY. TWO. WEEKS.
Okay then, the movement in this game looks super cool.
I can tell this was at target from the walkie noise
Oh shit watching these demo speedruns are my new favorite thing now
You wasted so much time waiting for the Broodal to finish her UFO phase. If you throw Cappy at one of the bombs she drops, it will hit her and knock her out of the sky, ending the phase like 5 seconds earlier.
They should just give you a free copy
Well done... can't imagine what you'll accomplish with the final game.
Awesome speed run! The hat throw is going to be really broken!
I love learning how to master how Mario controls in 3D Mario games and watching this speedrun only made me more excited to play Odyssey.
Holy shit\nThere is already a speed run of this game
In Super Mario 64 we had long jump spamming. In Super Mario Sunshine we had dive spamming. Now in Super Mario Odyssey we have rolling spamming. History repeats itself.
My target had the demo, and when I started it, the TV was at like max volume or something. Mario yelled “SUPA MARIO ODISEE” on it, and everyone within 30 feet of me stopped and stared at me
When you're an expert at a game that hasn't even come out yet.
This was from the Gamecity in Vienna right?
Jesus, the game isn't even released yet.
He was born here
Make an eshop demo Nintendo!
Wow how often did you play this demo?
The speed-running potential for this game is insane and it’s not even out yet
3:35 THAT MOVEMENT THO
this guy did NOT set up a tripod in the middle of Target... did he?
Excuse me but where did you play this at?
My target has no demo ;(
Definitely one or two things that could’ve been done a second faster, but overall this is pretty good. As someone who wants to speedrun this game myself, I can’t wait to get a hold of the game and start learning the controls. Also want to test a few things to see what can and can’t be done for skips, glitches, and overall time saves.
Speedrun of demo...
How can you rush such a fantastic game :(
I hate how they nerfed the long jump, I was fine with it in Galaxy but its called a long jump for a reason
There's actually a demo of this game out there?
SO. FUCKING. EXCITED. I mean fire emblem warriors will be good n all. but odyssey is where it's at
THANKYOU for this content! good movement was all I wanted to see but it's nowhere
There are no bad points in this game now!
How do you do the constant rolling?
This is giving the game some really good publicity
I think ground pounding on her head would've wrap the broodal fight up in just two hits.
So far the game isnt out and I can see the speedrunning possiblities are going to be amazing THUMBS UP!!
Dang the game isn’t even out and yet people are already speed running it.
Idk if this is true but I noticed that when you get close to her she’ll back up then attack a lot faster than just waiting for to attack
I can already see this will be great for speedrunning from this alone
this game is going to be so awesome to speedrun, especially 100% run
When you hang out all day at Circuit City playing the demos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OYXpKxHT4&t=7m52s here is the bomb reflect people are talking about.
I hope speedruns like this stay a thing when the game comes out. 10 min challenges and what not. It'd be fun to watch lol
Basically it's Mario spindashing at sanic speed.
The game is not even out yet and there is a speed run of it XD
I hope this starts a trend.
Holy fuck you are a psycho at this props to u
Damn dude. Great job! Where did u do this?
wow fast make new video
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF WAHOO.
Rolling around at the speed of sound. Oh wait wrong series...
i subscribed & i turned on the notification bell on, when you buy the game when it comes out speedrun it, your gameplay was smart af.
america is so lucky damn
Ohhh god, I actually can’t wait for this game to come out just for the speed runs
i love how mario is sonic now
And 3:29 SUPER MARIO GALAXY RETURNS
Holy fuck you’re really good!
CoolCat Moon Get CoolCat
Congrats on World Record.
Why do  you Always throw cappy before a Dive  even  when you are not Diving into cappy?
lmao
guiijiii!
Amazing speedrun!
12 days til' Christmas!
What?!
Dude\n\nWhat the fuck
daaaaamn man. Nice!
Awesome!
0:04 sanic gotta go fast
Nice
But first we need to talk about parallel universes.
Kool
Great.\nNow do it in 0.5 a presses.
How do you get this demo?
What buttons do you press to do the rolling move??\n\nAlso what buttons allow you to get back to your hat once you have thrown it?
How do you get the demo
Not fair! The demo at my target ended at 2:25
you odyssey this game its amazing
These speed runs make this feel like a true successor to super Mario 64. \nI'm sure some would prefer Galaxy or Sunshine, but this takes the cake.
And how did you get the demo?
I'm worried that the game seems rather empty due to the expansive landscapes not being more filled with objects.
this is a record that cannot be broken after the demo stands are beeing removed, you set an unbeatable world record! :D good job
Imagine the poor souls waiting their turns in line behind this guy
Why can't they have a demo on the switch?? Not in target or Best Buy of Walmart or anything...
These demos being speedrunned only makes me realise that if the 3D mario game after Odyssey DOES NOT HAVE a cappy equivalent (in terms of jumping toolset), the game will be automatically inferior.
*Camila's crew seem like such fun people and I'm so glad she is having such a fun time on tour. She is such a talented and* *amazing artist and I can't wait for her album. We covered her new song Havana on my channel, hope you will watch it.*

JUST DO A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY, WE NEED MORE OF THIS
So much fun !  They can be all friends but there is always a limit! She is their boss and they have to respect her as a boss and not as a friend... many singers go through the same stage of life that she is going... although she is having fun and she seems to be pretty cool
This reminds me of high school musical
I love her so much😧😭❤
The dancer Justin is hot 🔥💕
did no one else see the tr*mp tower at :20 cause that shit doesn't belong here
omg this was in Atlanta. I've been to both of the places she went to, they were fun asf
She’s so down to earth and keeps it real
The happiness I felt watching this
I love her voice I love her songs !!!! She's perfect !!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
i love you camila\nso much
I wish these videos would be longer
Every time this Havana starts in her documentary I go so emotional
I LOVE U AND I HAVE UR BACK ❤
So thanks full to god. Thank you so much to make this angel real, she's talented,  pure, amazing, beautiful, she's a true artist because she feels what she sing every time. I love you Camila ♡
I feel like this Toshi guy and Camila might... I dont know maybe  PR??
Man vids so short but u still get so much emotion out of it 😫💕
I love how the vids are SHORT AND EXCITING!!! 😍😍
this girl really never fails to inspire me so much. first, to just reach for your dreams no matter what happens; that it is scary but you just have to do it scared. now, to never forget to live because one day you'll look back at life and it's not the riches, fame, your occupation or your degree that will matter but the memories & relationships you created. im emo. i love her. 😭
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💜 🙈 , PERU PRESENTE Y APOYANDOTE 🌹 🙆❤❤
I felt like in a Grey's Anatomy episode lol
I love this please do more camila
I love you Camz you make my life so worth living and girl I can't wait for the Havana video

I clicked cause the hoes in the thumbnail are sexy af... Oops...

Please read this comment! The state of California has essentially legalized INTENTIONALLY infecting others with HIV via SB 239. I have created a White House Petition to call on congress to publically address SB 239 and call for its repeal! I have FaceBook group called Repeal Sb-239. If you could talk about SB-239 and address this issue and call for people to sign the petition it would be a great help. I am paying to promote a vid on my channel that talks about this because it sets a dangerous precedence! Please help! I need 100,000 signatures within 30 days. We could do something good!

Havana music video
es por eso que te amamos!! Buscas las cosas que realmente importan la felicidad, el amor, el respeto y no la fama que desgraciadamente a  muchos cega. Tienes valores y tus fans lo saben te queremos!!❤🌹❤
Who tf dare to dislike this vid?!
I have a question for camilacabello \nCan I make a mashup with your son Havana
that chick had THE WORST golf swing i've ever seen in my life.
So mila talked about how she felt when she is surrounded by those people and she said how much she loves them but...did she not have the same feelings in 5H? Did she not feel as if the girls had her back? Did she not feel as if they loved her? And b-4 yall talk...i like queen mila and yes shes not in 5H ik... it was just a thought 😙😙
Very nice, however that kid must have a terrible concussion.
now that is motherfucking impressive as all hell omfg
this was so very satisfying, thank you.
I’m unclear why  I laughed at this. Hilarious!
glad to see Line Rider in 2017 keep it alive!
This is the reason I still keep youtubing.\n\n\n\n I got an exam tomorrow. I hate you.
That was great! Thanks, YouTube recommended!
THAT IS AMAZING. I sat with the hugest, stupidest grin the entire time.
2:28 IS MY FAVORITE PART HANDS DOWN OH MY GODD
1.4 million views in 10 days for a game hardly anyone has played in 10 years. Well done. 👏🏼
best video of 2017 goes to...
That was the coolest thing i've seen
i played in the hall of the mountain king in 8th grade orchestra, so the piece has always had a special place in my heart. this is by far the most unique, creative, and worth while uses of the song i've ever seen. just incredible.
What makes people dislike this? I actually don't understand what there is to dislike about this.
Happy wheels level of this would be amazing
If you have ever played line rider, you know that this is truly the work of a god
u need to stop
That sleigh rider is very dead.
This is magnificent in every possible way!
>why is youtube reccomending an old line rider video\n*looks at date*\n>damn, people still play this game?
In the hall of the meme king
This is literally art. Good art. Really widely appreciable art. Made with Line Rider. I love it so much ❤️
That was amazing, but you should have, no wait...it is perfect
Do you have a picture of the full level zoomed out?
That was... impossibly epic, like, the best thing on the Internet
That was FANTASTIC!  And of course, it gets louder - it's the Hall of the Mountain King!  :-)
Great job. brought me to tears
Oh my goodness, I find this so satisfying.
2:13 bruh got blasted all the way to Jupiter
You need to make more of these this was amazing
Edgar Wright is shitting his pants right now
That's a really long climb up...
I love this song now
This was awesome. Great work man 👍🏻
This is actually competition for Baby Driver!!!
This is the best thing that has happened to me in 2017
That was so beautiful, I shed a tear. And I'm sporting quite the goofy smile. Two huge thumbs WAYY up!
This is damn fantastic.\nAnd wow, I can't believe Line Rider is still around!
Saw this on Facebook. The TIMING was PERFECT.
*This is truly a PHENOMENAL piano sheet*
This is just cool!  I use this for movement with my students all the time.  Can't wait to show them a visual representation of what they are hearing.
I wonder if the poor little guy would ride it again!
Why is this not on trending?
Finnish know this song because of dudesons!
Wow just nerdgasimed for so many reasons.  Nice work
wow. that is absolutely amazing. Thank you for doing that. Brought a smile to my face!
Props to you man I've tried line rider before and I know that this would've taken weeks to complete and master. Good job
oh my god that game
I LOVE the kettledrum finish, so awesome.
That was amazing ! Glorious. I wonder exactly how much time that took.?
twenty seconds in: liked & subscribed. this is the most entertaining video ive seen all year
*is there actually anything more amazing and beautiful than this?*
Anyone who loves this video should subscribe to him. If he gets enough subscribers out of this viral video then he can monetize his art and make more - that’s how we support someone on YouTube - thumbs up my comment so more people see this
parece um filme de edgar wright
DoodleChaos\nA tiny piece what could be made better: From 1:40 onwards, the track should have gotten a lot more frenetic, like hundreds of additional lines on the outside for the increasing feeling of epicness when the different octaves finally collide. But I can imagine you were mentally done at that point :D\nThinking how you had to always start from scratch after you added a tiny additional line at the end makes me shiver.
I'm in love with this!!! Amazing <3
That. Was. The. Most. Epic. Thing. Ever.
The internet is limitless source of information. But who needs that when the internet can do this.
Me vs. deadlines
Please. Make. More!!!!
AMAZING! SPECTACULAR!
Impressive
That... was pretty freaking cool.
KUDOS
Holy Moly!
FUUUCK YA
Omg this was SOOOO COOOOOLLLLLL\n :O
Holy shit
Amazing
Bravissimo
ART
*Stands up clapping*
So good!!!
So f***ing brilliant!
holy shit
That ending....
I actually cried laughing
This was beautiful
whoa
I remember this game omg
first
amazing
i am impressed
Just one month?
Truly excellent
Beautiful.
A R T !
art.
bewitching
Beyond impressive! Bravo!
This is awesome bro
is... dead.
¿Quisiste decir hola soy de mexico, he visto tu video en facebook y me gusto mucho. sigue asi :)?\nHi, I'm from Mexico, I've seen your video on facebook and I really liked it. keep it up :)
INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!
2:26 made me laugh!!!!
Very Creative <3
that was a fckin awesome!!
Ah... Perrier
AMAZING!
Wow...
You mean... you weren’t wearing makeup at the start of the video????? Wow goalsssss
It took me like 10 minutes, till you applied the perfecting tint, to realize you had no makeup on... looking gorgeous Anna xxx
Do not buy the vitamin C serum by Glossier. Vitamin C in a clear bottle is a no-no. Also, the serum is already tinted yellow. Not a good sign. For the niacinamide + zinc, opt for the The Ordinary one for a much better price. Same for the hyaluronic acid serum. Even better than The Ordinary, I would suggest the Hadalabo Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion.
Thanks Anz x

ArzuJann
Your hair looks so luscious!!!!
So helpful!!!! Thank you xx
I can't even get hold of glossier but this video was still so helpful! I want to watch it all over again 😅
What does the perfume smell like?
Getting my order delivered tomorrow😄
Thanks Anna, even though I use some products from Glossier for almost a year, after your video, I did another order! :D I guess I need to try all of them like you :D
Now I want to by everything haha! Thanks Anna!
How are you getting through so much product?? Can you show us how much cleanser or serum you use each time? My products last me half a year or so, so I'm worried I'm not using enough each time now.
HOLA muñecas a que hora salen por el pan bizcochitos
Very helpful video Anna! Thank you 😊 👌🏻
Nice review. Disappointing that Glossier has such a limited shade range.
Overpriced overhyped and hardly much coverage in any of the Base products . Watched a good few reviews of glossier and definitely nothing special
Love this, I went to the Glossier showroom when I was in NY a couple of weeks back, and pretty much bought everything you rate as good!\n\nWould love Glossier haircare next!!
This was v.helpful Anna! And your makeup looks super pretty xx
Best Glossier review I've watched! Well done 👍🏻
Loved seeing you work through all of these Anna! So happy for my friends in England who can finally grab it. As for Australia... we're used to being patient haha. I have a whole lot of individual detailed Glossier product reviews over on my channel for any UK girls who want to see swatches before they buy! x
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! \nI've been seeing sooo much hype around Glossier's products, and just had no idea where to begin or any idea of how to figure out if their products were worth picking up! This video is EXACTLY what I needed. So helpful Anna, you're such a babe! x
I've already done an order for the skin tint, the cherry balm dot com, the haloscope and the boy brow in black but you're making me want to buy more!!!!!!! My bank account is gonna be so mad at me.
I have a 10% discount for your first order 😁 - http://bff.glossier.com/gHtxF
Totally not related to the video, but I love your hair! It looks so shiny and smooth. What have you been using?
Thanks Anna. I was going to buy the Invisible Shield Factor 35 as I have the same type of skin as you but will save my cash and get the stretch concealer. x
The makeup looks lovely on you Anna!! I really hope they ship to Australia soon!!!!!
This was so useful! Now I know what to get 😉 and yay trending!!xxx
wow your product arrived the next day, meanwhile i just got an email from them saying my order's gonna take longer than expected (more than 5 business days) so unfair :(
i wonder if they ship out of UK, do they ship in other parts of Europe too, when ordering from the UK site?
Thanks for doing this review, Anna, I love your reviews!
Best set of reviews on Glossier that I’ve seen so far. You’re awesome. Now I know what I’m going to get and what colors. Xo 😘
Amazing review and really helpful! My bank balance is going to take a hit tonight! X
Your skin is so flawless! When the video started I thought you were wearing make up!
I really enjoy the Milky Jelly Cleanser but the Super Bounce did nothing for me. I have seriously dry, dehydrated skin and I felt very tight after using it.
That's a great lip color on you. I tried it and it didn't work. I thought the Generation G lip colors were toooooo drying and matte on me. The Stretch Concealer is my GO TO concealer...even with 56 yr. old undereye skin. It looks like skin and doesn't crease or settle!  Thanks for the review.
Bloody loved this, I know what's going on my Christmas list now!! Ps Anna you look gorgeous!! 😍
This was a great review 👏
I can't wear sunscreen directly on my skin. So I have to layer it on top of my moisturizer.
Thank you for this!! Super helpful. Feel like I can justify a couple new purchases now :)
Love the milky jelly cleanser.  The wowder made me break out.  I kept trying it because I really like the finish.  I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I just couldn't make it work.  The cloud paints were great, but after an hour they would disappear off my face.  I really wish they had more staying power.  Probably better for drier skin.
The Glossier Cloud Paints are my fave! I add a small dab of Puff to Dusk and it creates the most natural rosy nude. I find Dusk on its own to be too brown, and Puff to be too bright pink but together - perfection :)
I had a bit of a glossier shopping spree the Monday when uk shipping became available, after watching this I'm really happy about my choices and am looking forward to receiving them. I got the haloscope in quartz, the balm dotcom trio (rose, birthday and cherry) and the phase 2 set (light, brown and zip). Zip looks like it could be the exact wore look red I've been trying to find for months, I can't wait to try it all!!
Thank you for reviewing the body products as I was mulling those over. I will now give them a pass as I too have sensitive skin and can't tolerate overly fragranced products. Also, anyone with sensitive skin or Rosacea prone skin should always avoid chemical sunscreens and opt for the physical sunscreens.
Please make a skin care video with your favs, your face skin is awesome!
I can't get enough of the coconut balm dot com and Milky Jelly Cleanser!
Thanks Anna. Super helpful, well presented review. I was trying to resist buying anything and then, bang!, you hit us with the 10% off code. I've just bought half of the Glossier website and couldn't be happier! Hoping Cake Generation G will make me look as fly as you and Allana :]
you always come up with the most helpful and well thought out videos! btw you're skin looks absolutely incredible! when you started putting make up on I got so confused hahah xx
I made my first Glossier order a few weeks ago and ordered one of almost everything! The only thing I do not care for is the skin tint. It makes me look like an oil slick about 2 hours in. Loved this review and you are the reason I made the order in the first place!
Oh man - Wish I'd watched this before I ordered some products! I need some Generation G!!
Love the thorough review! I'm also waiting for Glossier to release a bronzer :).
As a Combo skin, sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skinned girl - the original priming moisturizer is holy grail for me. Changed my skin for the better.
Thank you for this Anna, very informative and on the strength of this have ordered a few items to try. I don’t know if you have been asked this before, and I know you’re pushing Glossier here, but have you ever tried any of The Ordinary serum products? If you have, I wondered how comparable you found them to say the Glossier serums? Thanks.
LOL definitely pale! - Right there with you! Thanks for the reviews, I placed my order the other day and can't wait to get it!
Thanks Anna! Really great informative video, my Glossier shopping list just got longer! Also noticed you are number 8 on Trending!!
You have such amazing brows, do you do anything to tame them, grow them, keep them healthy? Gorg! Xxx
You’re not the first one who itches after the shower gel. I’m missing out on these!
No customs? In that case I'll probably try the boy brow at some point since it's cheaper than benefit gimme brow. I haven't purchased a gimme brow in the new packaging yet because I don't like the new packaging and I'm annoyed that they increased the price.
I like that you kept it realistic! Xx
I've been looking forward to this video so much. However my first thought at the start was your hair looks great.
Love this- just done a glossier shop and this totally helped me make an informed decision. Bought stretch concealer, priming moisturiser rich and moon mask 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Thanks for the comprehensive review Anna!
you should always wear this tint ! it's so nice on your skin
Just waiting for my first order, looking forward to trying them. PS, I just listened to a podcast where Emily Weiss mentioned she uses her milky jelly cleanser on her err intimate area, you’re welcome lol xx
All the makeup YouTubers paying to get on trending hahah
out of everything you showed in your video today ima buy the bobbi brown  brush...and the cleanser
Ah I'm about to place an order but I can't select shipping in the uk anymore. I almost placed one yesterday and it was fine then 😭
Amazing run through! Thx Anna! Feel super informed and ready to hit up the site x
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this aha xxxx
Hi Anna, you mentioned having psoriasis a couple times before and I wonder if you could you do a psoriasis video? Not very glamorous I know haha - mine pretty much disappears in the Spring and reappears in Autumn so I would love to know your tips before it comes back. Thank you!!
Getting my order tomorrow can't wait 😀
Dying to know how the new perfume smells!?
I love crush!!! It looks great on my skin tone!!! I think it’s a very universal shade!!!
I disagree with the skin tint! I have OILY skin and that product is a holy grail. Matifying products always break down weirdly on oily skin. I just embrace my shine and that product doesn't break me out at all
Loved this.  Almost placed an order but glad I waited.  Based on your information about using the products for awhile, I have changed my mind about some items.  This video has helped me out a lot!  Thanks for the very helpful info, Anna!!
Thank you so much for this Anna.  I am about to do my first order and this is so helpful. X
Its been a month and i was skeptical to order but now I'm going to buy. Its a big order but im very curious to not look so beat. Im a little over that look. And this company celebrates natural beauty. I do have acne scaring not so severe but as my skin heals i feel its best to embrace my flaws as they recover. Long story short im buying.
Such an insightful video, can't wait to order! xxx
Obvs I placed an order on Monday (hurry up and arrive please!) but now watching this makes me want to go for order number two!
Can't wait for my order, watching you and Lily rave about this has made me so excited for UK shipping. Not sure my credit card will thank me though! Thanks for such a great review!!
Hiya, I sent you an email about helping me with my a level EPQ, would really appreciate if you reply as soon as possible xx
my first order is on the way over from the US right now. yay to shipito. I'm kind of excited - I hope I picked the right shades. I was like you know what you look like a mozzarella just get the lightest one of everything 😂
Very helpful! I'm hinting to family in the UK to send some to me in SA. Totally unrelated but... what do you use on your hair? It's always so lovely and shiny and sleek.
Thanks Anna this was very helpful - I have ordered the milky cleanser and concealer, hooray!
I love Generation G! They give a tinted look but feel nicer than a lip tint. I also really love the Milky Jelly Cleanser, Haloscope (Quartz) and Cloud Paints (Puff and Dusk for day, Haze for night. I'm also really enjoying Wowder (I look moisturized but it tamps down the Glossier look of looking like I can fry an egg on my face haha). The rest I'm kind of meh with. Stretch Concealer was a fail because I feel like it didn't actually conceal anything and Priming Moisturizer Rich WAS THE THE WORST because the lavender oil broke me out. I was so disappointed when I saw the lavender oil in the ingredients list but I bought it anyway because I love the brand. Anyway it was good to my skin for about two weeks and I actually thought the lavender oil would be ok...and then it murdered my skin. SMH.
Thanks so much for this! As someone with oily acne prone skin most of the skincare is a miss for me and makes me break out terribly (ugh superbounce was awful for me) so I appreciate the disclaimer in the beginning. I would stay away from all the skin products if you have acne prone skin even the concealer and highlighter which has coconut and castor oil. Don't get sucked in!
Just about the order my basket then this popped in to my subscription box !!  Perfect timing thanks Anna !!

I'm loving the look of your hair on this video Anna! You look so pretty :)
Love you and your videos! For redness you should try dr. Jart’s cicarepair tiger grass in the pot! Its so good and has spf in it too 👍🏼 really think you’ll like it 🤗
Just back from New York (still strugling with my jetlag), but I think it's a hype. Only bought the cleansing gel (is ok) and the brow gel. Otherwise, nothing special. It's all about the woman who really doesn't need make up.....(according to the Hirons lady),....so why use it than? Marketing: genius, quality wise: nothing special. So thanks, but no.thanks! 😂😎 And for the stickers...sorry, I'm nót a teenager that loves little kitty!
Yes, Glossier is really hyped, but I have a few issues with some of their products. I have no sensitive skin a lot, but skin tint, priming moisturizer and sometimes even the concealer make my eyes burning like crazy! I love the milk jelly cleanser, the balm - I should have picked the coconut one instead of the birthday one because I wake up in the morning with glitter everywhere on my face :P - and also the lipstick in Leo.
giiiirl, please do a body care video! I have terribly dry skin and love any recs to make my life better <3
I made my first glossier order 3 days ago now, and it still hasn't been dispatched :(
There are heaps of Korean sunscreens that leave no white caste and have an SPF 50! Check them out - a lot cheaper and great for sensitive/light skin 😊
It is a very comprehensive video BUT please no more glossier.  I'm fed up of hearing it on your channel
Why is this on trending😐👏🏼
*the mole on your cheek looks like it has its own gravity and is pulling the side of your lips towards it*\n\n\n\n*jk :D, love ya!*
There is an imperfecto ruler right now and nobody gets it either.
Omg I love this Cliff guy so much! So full of energy and you can really tell he loves his work. I wanna be like Cliff when I grow as old as he is.
NUMBERPHILE PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT\nCould you do a video about the number 672? That would be amazing
Is there somewhere I can print off the offset sheet and ruler?
What is an iphone guy?
Infectious enthusiasm! Love teachers like this. This is how to make learning fun.
Who is this guy? So funny! :D
**goes to my locker to check if my ruler isn’t duplicating numbers**
This guy is straight outta the creed. Nothing is true; everything is permitted.
We must know, we will know. I could not agree more!
I've got a question, but first let me set the scene. \n\nSo, I was calculating the limit of x->4 of (x²-2x-8)/(4x-x²) this would equal -1,5. Of course if x=4 there would not be a y-value because you would divide by 0. So wondered what it would look like if you zoom in on the the point A(4;-1,5). I took my calculator (TI-84 plus CE-T), put in the function and started to zoom in. Eventually I started to see something that looked like random spikes in the line.\n\nSo my question is: why does this happen?
For some reason this guy reminds me of Scott Bakula.
what is 1110 to the power of 1111 ?
You are cruel! I love it.
He missed a couple of assumptions:  Even if you caught the two 17's on the ruler, whose to say the ruler is calibrated correctly?  And if you're using the other sheet of paper to check squareness, you better know that your source sheet is also square.
Legend has it that his brain is a Klein bottle
Awwwww, Metriiic!  Do I have toooooo!?\n\nI don't know how I would have handled this as a student.
I would conjecture that the likely enduring memory of his students would not relate to mathematics, but rather be something along the lines of, Trust less.
theres holes in the paper
Paper size nerd. The second he gave the measurements, I knew something was off.
I think if you get Cliff Stoll and Matt Parker together, tell them go off come up with something together in secret, you have 3-12 months, as needed, the result would be *spectacular!*
Hey Numberphile, so I found this geometric puzzles called Euclidea. You can feature some problems there. It will be interesting to watch mathematicians doing that game.
That guy is a beauty
Make a model of the paper and measure the paper with photographs and electron beams and write some simple software to measure the output and report on surface area. Measure model map I always say. Thanks for the Hilbert quote. We will know!!
Can you fill a klein bottle with watter?
I don't really know about doing an integral, but couldn't I just measure and subtract the area of the triangles that are made when the papers are lined up? 1:45
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN OWNING AN IPHONE I NEED TO KNOW
I would use a scanner to determine the area. Would just need to determine how much area each pixel is.
It was Hilbert: Wir müssen wissen, wir wereden wissen, in response the the Latin maxim igroamus et ignorabimus (we do knot know and we will not know).\n\nI hate not being able to solve a puzzle. It will consume me until I know. This is a trait I have in common with a very large number of scientists and engineers. I think it's innate rather than taught. Some people are happy not to know.
I feel like noticing the trapezoid paper (and the innacurate ruler) is one of the few things that would be easier in American units, because our papers are all 8.5x11, so when you start measuring and it's 8.45x10.9, something's wrong. If it's 8.45x9.9, there's something very wrong.
Can numberphile make a video on infinity - infinity =π
Cliff both looks like and has the same speech patterns as Rick Sanchez.
How on earth can he forget Hilbert's name?
My first thought was the ruler tbh.
Cliff, if you teach a math class at school, I would gladly drop everything and go back to school, that school to be specific
This guys brain is wired just like mine
I like that feeling
I want to ask that guy a question
Is the Earth pear shaped?
Why don’t more teachers do this? You know, make students think. This man is brilliant.
So enthusiastic about his work.. I Really like him...mathematically speaking..
This was exactly how I got a job as a sound tech in college! They asked why I wanted the job with no experience, I just said, every time I walk by a sound board, I want to know what all those knobs do.\nThe real answer was that I didn't want to work in the dish pit, but I got in regardless.
have he done a video about everyone is 7 handshakes away from the president? i found that odd
i love this guy
Clifford Stoll is a Ph.D. astronomer. But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \n\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\n\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.
For a moment I thought I was watching Julias Sumner Miller. Those were the days.
i was a little sad about my future, but after i watched this, it encouraged me.
This man looks like Einstein on weed
This guy is what indiana jones would look like when teaching
Cliff is great, would have liked to have had him as a teacher for sure. Enthusiasm is important
Acting outlandishly can get you a fair bit of mileage.
I thought that one of the interpretations would include measuring the depth of the paper by folding it and using the depth to find the area of its edge-like sides.
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
the moment I saw the homework assignment, I immediately thought that I would measure it by attempting to cut a shape of known area, and weighing that piece. Then weighting the whole sheet and multiplying by the known mass per a unit of area (this is how we used to do it for figuring the area under a chromatography trace.)\n\nFor the sides, I was thinking I would cut the paper into several pieces and stack them, to get the thickness of the paper, but I am not sure how precisely the cut edge of the paper matches its thickness.
This is beautiful, Cliff
I want to be his student
Great advice for youngsters, and others too.
I actually hired someone not once, but twice for two different companies because he said in the first interview “I don’t know, but I know I can figure out the problem if I had more time and the right tools.” This was after he tried to trouble shoot a timed, and impossible to solve, hardware problem (yes I rigged it).
I love him so much 💗💗💗
His students are lucky.
Great video! Having that sort of mentality can get you into trouble at work sometimes, people just want instant results these days and consider curiosity a waste of time. I just had a shitty day at work because of that and I feel better now knowing there are different people out there.
I loved this!! What an awesome guy! And super interesting
This guy should have a TV show only for himself
How is this man still not knighted?
I still don't know how to meassure the paper properly now.
This guy is AMAZING !!!!
I knew he was probably gonna tell me that measuring a piece of paper may not be as streight forward as I think... but this.. I didn't expect this..... awesome.
and no students notices that with that definitely Trumpfakish ruler, the usual 20x27cm sheet of paper measured... 20x26cm ;-) (check on the video)
This video probably had a larger impact on me than 4 years of high school teachers. Education is so much more than standardized tests and memorization. It's about learning how think and feel and react. This was beautiful.
This 5 minute video conveys a sense of scientific rigor so amazingly well!\nI love this so much, I emailed it around the intro physics lab department at my university yesterday morning.  This morning, we're talking about maybe using this as the first lab of the fall semester for next year's program.\n8th grade?  The lessons in this video apply at all levels of research.
o didn't think you'd be an iPhone guHILBERT DAVID HILBERT
That's really educational!\nBtw, I was unintentionally expecting a cry of Great Scott lol
He goes on about the desire to know things, only to go all around trying to find that mathematician's name. That's one way to show you stick to your philosophy!
3:50 This is something that comes natural in CERTAIN areas. For some people its science others its math, others its English.
Find the minimum value of (10a+13)^1/2+(10b+15)^1/2 given that a+b=10
This is the kind of teacher I aspire to be.
Can Cliff Stoll be my professor?  Please?
I would assume there would be some chance that the students results in many cases would not match based on which edges they measured.\nSo then, have them explain why . This would be interesting to observe.\n\nMight experiment on my kids ... now where do i get an imperfecto  ruler.  Must be one in my garage somewhere.
I really wish I had been a student in one of Cliff's classes. He has such great enthusiasm for everything and I love his take on maths and sciences! Every Numberphile video I watch featuring him makes me super happy and pumped! If he ever did an encore class, I'd do everything in my power to attend as I envy his former students!
I would love to have him as a teacher
Just like Doc Brown: kinda crazy, totally enthusiastic. Lovely.
Homework every night? No thanks
1.21 jiggawatts
Yes.
Savage Klein bottle guy
We love parker square!
This guy is sooo cool.
This is sooooo cooooool!!!!
Klien bottle guy!

Real life Doc. Brown
What a delightful person.
Cliff reminds me of doc brown
I feel cheated.
Cliff rocks!
YAYYYY CLIFF!!!
Amazing! :D
Mad genius
great advice! I was caught.\ner. why two '17' on the ruler? lol. about the wrong 'tool' to use?
This dude is  unbelievable.
Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
Wallowa Lake Monster debuted at #8 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwo_Ucs-wc4&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=8
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
a 10 minute edit of the outro \npls
The lyrics of this song make me think of a family losing their mother to alcoholism. Additionally, it is sung very beautifully.
I NEED A MYSTERY OF LOVE!!!!
The beauty of this song makes up for my disappointment that the new release is not Mystery of Love
I'm from Wallowa lake and the lake monster is actually a real urban myth from the Nez Perce Tribe I was told growing up:) this makes me so happy.
<3
Thank you, beautiful Sufjan xx you break my heart every day but you somehow make it sweet and glorious to feel the aches and agonies of being alive. I love you x
That verse melody is quite something...
when i am listening one of the sufjan's songs i feel like i am the most depressed person on all world.and i dont know why but i love that feeling
when i first saw the song's title, i really thought it would be a single for the Oregon album
His voice whispering those beautiful words into my ears in the darkness of my bedroom with that music! Holding my tears (sad/joyful) until he says no oblation will bring her back to our place. God bless you Sufjan!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Spathiphyllum, cedar waxwing, and charybdis all in one song about a mother. This may be my favorite of Carrie and Lowell. \nHear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more, forever.\n-Chief Joseph of the Wallowa
fuck you this is depressing as fuck
Oh! Miss Sufjan, you shouldn't have!
the beginning is like a softer version of weird fishes
My heart is about to break again
Stunned by the beauty of this song
The brass and strings in this song sound similar to those in some parts planetarium
♥
More of Carrie and Lowell is always welcome
Between God and mortals, there is Sufjan Stevens. Pure magic.
Subaru Stevens back on his shit
I was just at Wallowa Lake last weekend! Beautiful place.
Woah... Haven't gotten these Age of Adz vibes in a long time... But seamlessly blended with with Carrie and Lowell magic.
Yo this is depressing as shit.
omg this was exactly what I needed, bless u Sufjan
This is what genius sounds like.
First 10 seconds sound a lot like Everybody Wants To Rule The World
Heard this yesterday, for the first time. Thanks Gorilla vs. Bear! So beautiful!
Sounds like something exactly between C&L and Planetarium. Bless him.
the second half straight up beat me up, this is so good
I don't know how he managed to make me cry with all his songs.
more proof that carrie & lowell could've been his oregon album
Holy shit this is beautiful, can't wait!!!
This is hypnotic. Just gorgeous.
The 3-minute outro is bringing me to fucking tears. Greatest artist alive, without a doubt.
i thought it was mystery of love...this is better
This guy is a genius
is this a nylon banjo?
It's hard to believe that I've loved Sufjan for 12 years now.
Thank you thank you so much for releasing it on my birthday ❤
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
what a beautiful slow drift of an ending
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
I never clicked a video so fast and I was not disappointed
Sufjan been listening to some BOC
just heard this today on the radio tripped me out hard core
Had a crappy day. This made it better
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Sufjan I would do anything for you
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
monsters showing their face = 2017
2:13 I melt
Gawd I love him

HOLY FUCK WHAT??
‘Trending’
Thank you
beauuuuutiful!
I fucking love you Sufjan❤❤
Exquisite Sufjan. I love you.
The Greatest Gift is Sufjan Stevens himself. An angel in our midst, singing to God for all of us.
this song is like half carrie and lowell, half age of adz
is he gonna release more music soon?
18 days left.
not much moved me to tears but blue bucket of gold live.  until this... and now it all makes me cry.  in a good way\n...I think.  well it's beautiful isn't it.
this is where sufjan is at his best ... stripped back, folk-y, vulnerable. love it.
Sufjan, it's hard to tell if you're a better poet or a musician. Absolutely incomparable genius
In 1885, a prospector, who wished to keep his identity a secret, was about midway across the lake when he saw an animal about fifty yards to the right of his boat. The animal reared its head and neck out of the water about 10 feet, paused, then quickly dove back into the water.
Sufjan Stevens is my favorite musician because he is artsy
i love Lindsey as a blonde!
Thanks to you I am being opened up to a great artist Raja Kumari, uhh she is dope. <3 where is she in the video??
Ya think she ever sleeps in ?
Ok good music but why is indian kathak music in a middle east inspired video. Its almost like you dont understand what youre taking things from like youre just going oh that sounds exotic and eastern lets just put that in shall we
Wow that video was so amazing!
You are so amazing!! I love your creations! Your talent is a real tresure in this world! Congratulations!!! 😍👌🏻👏🏻
Yea,  well I can Peel a whole orange in one go. Lol
How she can dance, paly the volin and sing 😱😱😱

Good job on dancing with the stars lindsey your dance was awesome  you got a 28 keep up the good work I know you will win this year!!!!!!!💃💃

It's too cute! Love Lindsey <3 <3 <3

Lindsey is an amazing artist!!
I'm going to see her in cerder rapids Iowa this desember I can't wait
My goodness, so elegant. And the speed of that plucking! I'm truly impressed, you are very talented Lindsey. Through your art you've earned my respect.
Can't believe you have added indian music into this and it has come out amazing....
This is my favorite song off the Brave album!
I'm a beginner cello player, i hope to one day be as good at the cello as you are at violin :D You're an inspiration to many people Lindsey <3
God every time she touches that violin my heart melts because of her music she is really amazing and very inspiring with her music and I thank you Lindsey Sterling for making me the person I am
Another AMAZA-BALLS vedio. Keep up the good work Lindsey Stirling.
I love your music! Can you play Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance? Please, or because Halloween is coming can you play a song from Nightmare Before Christmas?
I want a wall paper for my computer of you in the war paint look. That is so hot looking!
I was subscribed to her since when she had 400,000 subscribers now she has 9,000,000 wow 😮
Tripple combo in the air and a shotgunning of a quick Bulgarian beer, while taking a couple of paparazzi with a high kick out ouf your space is the least thing I can do for you, girl ;)
Lindsey, you never fail to impress me
This is by far your most unique piece.
I would love to have violin lessons from you ❤❤❤❤
wth where is the music? It's all violin. Where is the dubstep, and tehno?
AMAZING!!! XD :D :) I want to go to one of your concerts so bad.. Please have one in California!!!
I would    love     you  and  Estas  Tonne     work     together
I made a nightcore of this is u wanna check it out
LOVE IT AS ALWAYS!
Been a fan for years. Even watch you're collabs with various youtuber's and of course the whole Dancing with the Stras thing. Love everything you do. Keep it up chick.
I absolutely love this music, but singing is too much. i found singing disruptive...
You ALWAYS just know, and new video from Lindsey is going to be REMARKABLE, and it always IS.
Though the music sounds like it is Indian the video seems to have an Arabic influence, but it is still amazing
I thought this was meant for a csgo map. Pardon for my rudeness
Sorry to say this but I don't like this  combination
What kind of violin is that and what kind of strings are on it to make it sound amazing
Can't help but feel like singing 1 pound fish to this...
I LOVE this clip and I love her music.
First thought: Welcome to Bollywood :D
Oddly this doesn't entirely remind me of Bollywood, it also reminds me of pirates. More accurately, the pirate shanties from A.C.: Black Flag.
THE VIOLIN SOUNDS AMAZING ;D
But it is very beautiful this cat ... Success for you Lindsey, I love you and your work, if a day comes to Brazil let me know kisses !!!!!!!!
Some say Lindsey's violin  is magical and any tears brought on by the sounds echoing from it, will cure all sadness.
Her grandma was one of our patients.she played violin everytime  she visits her grandma here in shadypines care home
I like \nI love you lindsey \nAtt: the bams
I LOVE HOW SHE CAN DANCE AND PLAY THE VIOLIN TOGETHER AND SEPARATELY SHES SO COOL
loves  your vids  n  when you go all out  dressing up  in ya vids.........also love  when ya  dress down   n  show the world  you re   just another  regular girl in the world......you  rock  Lindsey.......keep up the good work.
How do you bend back while playing violin like I tried and I almost fell over and nearly wrecked my violin
That Thaka dina made my Indian self jump out of my seat LINDSEYYY YOU HAVE MY HEART
You look absolutely stunning in blonde, sweetheart <3
Creative and wonderful as always! 💞🌸💞
Anybody else think a Ludovico Einaudi and Lindsey Stirling mashup would be beautifully epic?
She's like the Lady Gaga of the violin.
really love the indian theme \n<3 <3 <3
tekutaka takatu denim denaka takakaka hahaaha

Gorgeous babe! SO GLAM and pretty <3 LOVEEEEE!

I am going to try to recreate this look! I love that it's still really pretty and girly! I'm going to use rhinestones for teeth though! 😁 Great tutorial girl 💕
so pretty!!! xo from my channel to your’s <3
OK I just tried doing this and it came out that I was a donkey? Yea I'm not good at doing makeup
I’m gonna have to do something similar to this! I got a glow in the dark skeleton t shirt to take the boy trick or treating
You're the best :) skull <3\n\nIG my_insta_soul  :) come in <3
Dayummmmm
This is sooooo pretty
So cool:)
Katy I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Lowkey, when I saw the cover I thought it was Sandra Bullock and I almost cried bc I love Sandra Bullock more than life.
How You Make A Skull Look Sexy & Colorful 😩🔥🔥🔥
You need to start a face chart series where you do a series of a bunch of face charts you like ❤️❤️😭😭😍😍 love you girl
The coverfx drops don' t play well with any makeup underneath.
Katy your skin looks extra bomb!! Did you add something new to your skincare routine?? Love you btw and love this look! ❤️❤️
I love how people talk shit and then say “no shade”. Excuse me but you’re just being a bitch NO SHADE gtfo
Katy have you ever had that mole on the left side of your chest checked out? asking bc u my girl
Great work! Funny how you look like you have a permanent frown 😅
your lips make me want to eat powdered donuts 🤔
U look like Kim K with that blonde hair! 😳 Love this Katy!!! 😍😍😍
I love when you do colorful and creative looks! They just look sooo bomb on you. 🙌🏽💕💜Like your face charts omg I dieeee, keep it coming @Katy! 💗💖
What you said was holo was NOT holo smfh
Ok I love this n all, but is it weird that I like you and Desi's hands? Like weirdest comment ever js tho🤣🤣 like the hands have posture haha
😍😍😍😍😍😍
❤️💖
i don't get the dots on you forehead?
Can you do a fortune teller Halloween look
E n te R
What other holosexuals got trigger when she said holo when there’s no holo on her look?
I'd like to skull fuck this girl.
I thought to myself I can do this, lets check the video out.  After watching a bit,  I would definitely never ever be able to do this. Very cool!
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love it, but I really love the eyes. I'm going to wear the eyes as an everyday look lol
Looove! And I love the hair color on u!
You should have done your neck as well! 😊
How is this video advertiser friendly? I thought your immense beauty would trigger some kind of a red flag.💕
How do you look look gorgeous with every hair colour 💁🏻❤️
This is how you do a pretty skull look for Halloween without appropriating another culture.  Love it!
So dope K A T Y 💜💕
Girrrrrrl how is this even easy, it would take me a thousand hours and would come nowhere near as good as yours lol.
you look like Kim K with the wig on.
Am I the only one that think she looks like Kim kardashian???
Dam! I feel so inspired now! Thanks Katy!
Love it purple is my fav!! 💜
Can't wait to recreate this 😘😘😘
I think this look would have looked a bit better if the contour section were a bit more anatomically correct.  You put too much of the pink on your cheecks when it should have been lighter in the front and darker(more pink) towards the hollows. Overall you did a great job Katy. Practice makes perfect.
I love the eye makeup so fucking much
Barbie 💕💜💕💀 I love this
GIRL!!...IF YOU DONT BRING BACK THE MALFOY HAIR!!!😤
Living, breathing, dying for this look yassss

Any small YouTubers wanna support eachother?? 💜 let me know 👇👇👇👇
You don't have to create Halloween looks just because all the other YouTube people do it. Not everyone celebrates it lol
Uhm I'm a smaller makeup artist and I did this look 20 years ago. I can tell you got inspiration from me so could please give credit where credit is due?
This is not very accurate. The girl doesn't have a clue what an audiophile listens for. And the Yamahas are used for checking the balancing between the instruments and to give an idea how the recording will sound on a more common (crappy) stereo equipment. This is how commercial record industry produces records. They ought to have used well produced jazz recordings instead. There's no compromises on those recordings. This is just a fraction of what's wrong with the industry.
I think we should still consider frequencies outside of our hearing ability range because it's not only our ears that responds to frequencies. Our entire body does.
i also got 4/6 right but i REALLY had to listen closely like i never did before XD i took the test with Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro and it was HARD i would say for average listeners 128k mp3 is totally fine
Great video, but for me, NOTHING sounds better than a CD or LP, specially when you´re holding the booklet/cover, reading the lyrics and watching the photos or the art. (I think I´m in the audio-fooled category, hahaha).
I've been recording my latest releases purposely in 16bit 44khz.  I find it easier and more comfortable to mix. Than 48khz 24bit.   And it goes down to MP3 formats fairly easily.  Sounds fine.  This could also be just in my head.
Fun fact : youtube's sound quality is 192kbs-mp3 and people are typically completely fine with that
What's your take on Roger Nicoles?
Unpayable information! Thanks for this video.
I've heard rumor of a study done on different audio formats and the emotional effects on the brain. Have you heard anything of this study? I've tried to find it... but then again i haven't looked too hard. lol.\n\nthanks!
Finally someone saying it in a forwardable video.
The Yamaha NX 10 has a frequency range from 60Hz - 20Khz, 60 Hz is really not deep enough for mixing, the deepest Note a normal E-Bass can play (E) is about 40 Hz.
This video is another reminder that bits & data are for the machines people...the machines..
First, I still listen to CD. Second, people who care enough can hear the difference between CD and mp3.
I agree with everything said in this video (especially regarding the quality of 320kb/s MP3), however MP3/AAC is not an archival format. When I purchase music, I want it in a future-proof format that can be transcoded without causing further harm to the audio. For that reason, please consider offering your music in lossless formats such as FLAC or WAV.
Do frequencies that you can't hear still interact with frequencies that you can hear? So even though a person can't hear above 14k is it necessary to expose the ear to the entire frequency range in case the inaudible frequencies impact what you can hear?
Can you hear the difference between a vinyl record and an mp3?
Can't tell if the following applies to her, but I've noticed that frequencies above like 10 kHz become drastically more difficult to hear when my hair is stuck between my ears and headphones!
I did the test, got 2/6 (although I did misclick one of them), which really just suggests I performed no better than randomly picking. Weirdly, I normally picked the 128 file over the 320 file.\n\nMy earphones aren't the greatest, but given I use these for casual music listening that really doesn't matter too much.
This was my first time trying something like this, I've always listened to mp3s and have never been dissatisfied; people who claimed to only listen to high quality audio seemed pretentious to me, but I suppose it's worth it to investigate. Thanks for making this video. \n\nI took the test multiple times and found I was able to get the Jay-Z and Katy Perry songs almost every time; I could hear the difference in the sub-bass. The other ones I missed almost every time. \n\nIf mp3 works as you described, cutting inaudible/nearly inaudible frequencies above and below the human hearing spectrum, then shouldn't only certain instruments be affected? I feel like the human voice one would lose the least when compressed, cause the voice literally evolved to be heard by the human ear; there isn't much to be cut, is there?\n\nMaybe DJs ought to use uncompressed audio to get a little bit more top and bottom out of big sound systems. Seems like classical or acoustic music wouldn't really benefit from being uncompressed, but these are just guesses.
Another brilliant, insightful and helpful video. Thanks for dispelling the myths, Rick! Love it!
Assuming people are using quality headphones or speakers.  Beatz by dre and earbuds don't have the resolution to pick out a good from bad recording.
So Katy Perry's and Coldplay's production quality is crap? \n\nEDIT: Okay so now in the middle of the vid, different hypothesis. Maybe because the two employed big time producers, who can't hear those high pitches so it wasn't in consideration.
In my opinion this is very subjective. Just as compression used in mixing can be bad or good bit rate and and depth can also be. Even 8 bit files can sound better than 16 bit in certain cases. So, my philosophy is always go with the highest bit rate and depth reasonably possible. Rendering down is easy but rendering up is not techinaly possible. \n\nI took the test myself. I chose the uncompressed more often but even after knowing the bit rate my opinion did not change. That last song she did DID sound better at a lower rate in my opinion. Could even be the engineer mixed it so that it would sound better with mp3 compression. Actually, in fact that is something I've heard engineers discuss.\n\nOh and another point is that people do sample music from albums (obviously) and therefore will prefer a lossless format.
Please prepare better. You completely missed what is MP3. tha algorithm works different way than you said. the difference is audible. it just depends on yourr hearing and the hardware and the most important is the sound - the record You use. there is no reason to use MP3 today when disk space is cheap and internet is fast enough. MP3 should be forgotten.
My biggest issue w/ lower rate MP3s is that many songs end up w/ some weird phasing artifacts in the high end (cymbals, etc.) when listening through headphones or close spaced monitors.  Once the bit rate is above 192-256Kbps, most of those artifacts become less noticeable.
You may find Andy Clark's work in predictive coding (perception is a controlled hallucination) as a model from neuroscience applied to this discussion.   There are papers on the web.   Still reading the Sapolsky book here and arranging a new song before bringing in the guys (yeah, luvs my Guitare Pro) so haven't dug deep into Clark yet.   Still his ideas about priors and top down organization for predictive coding accord with other work .   Have a look in your copious spare time.\n\nRecommended your album to David Crosby this AM when he asked on his FB page about music to listen to on Music Monday.   Dunno if he took up the recommendation but being a lover of advanced harmony, he might.   Looked at the album on your page.  You named each piece for the scales?   Now THAT is academia, Dude.   Neat though.  Cheers.
Rudy Van Gelder, the great jazz recording engineer, recorded great albums well into his 80s.
Thanks for your honesty on this. I consider myself to have a pretty good ear, and I'd concede that in the realm of digital audio, there's a certain threshold re: the sample rate where once you get above that threshold, any difference I hear is likely psychosomatic. I contend that I can often hear the difference between a 128 and a 320 mp3, but even then it largely depends on the music itself and what kind of audio information it contains. Something with a lot of splashy or crispy cymbals, for example, can suffer from compression artifacts at 128.
HI Rick\n\nFirst time commenting on one of your videos.  Thanks for this.  I know there are a lot of people that don't understand that the quality of digital encoding is what is most important.  Yes, to most people listening to a 320K mp3 will be indistinguishable from a wav or flac encoding of the same source.\n\nMy personal preference is to go with flac files, not because of any audiophile bs, but because I can hear minor differences depending on the original source.  I bring up this as a point because it is interesting.  I took that NPR test when it came out and got 5 out of 6 correct. I can't remember if it was Katy Perry or Coldplay I got wrong, but it was one of those two.\n\nThe thing that I found most interesting was that the recordings that were definitely analog sources (Perahia and Neil Young) were actually easy to tell the difference.  The ones that were digital sources (Coldplay, Katy Perry) were more difficult...  And I was left wondering how many of the factors around the differences. (IE, digital vs analog source recording, time periods during which the recordings were made, and differences in studio recording and mastering techniques).\n\nThe Suzanne Vega track is an interesting one, which I would have thought most people would get wrong, given it's role as a model in the development of the MP3. And yet, many people seem to be able to tell the difference with that track.
I prefer lossless / FLAC..I absolutely can tell the diff but only because I’m a guitar player & hobbyist producer
You and Scott Grove ( Groovy Music Lessons) should get together and do a show. I imagine it like Car Talk on NPR.
I record at 96kHz so all the frequencies I can't hear can be used to annoy cats and dogs. I record at 24bit so that uncompressed, Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture will immediately cause tinnitus. Problem?
Surprisingly, I earned 4/6.
It's interesting that the two that she got wrong are modern, digital, height-of-the-loudness-war tracks, while 3/4 of the ones she got right are pre-2000, originally-recorded-on-tape songs. Including, of course, Tom's Diner, which was the standard that Brandenburg used to create the mp3 format. I'd even guess that the mastering on Dark Horse and Speed of Sound were specifically designed to sound ~perfect~ all the way down to 128kbps, while the Neil Young, Murray Perahia and Suzanne Vega tracks would have been mastered within the limitations of the analogue domain and suffered as a result of increasing levels of file compression after being digitised later on.
Rick putting things in perspective. People can get lost in all the numbers and technical info, which is important and if you work with audio it's info you have to know, but it should not get in the way of what really matters which is Does it sound good? Is the sound coming out of the speakers/earphones making me FEEL something?. Great vid Rick!
I am one of those people with golden ears. It's not all that great though: They weigh more than my head, and I can hear F*** all. On the plus side, I don't have to worry about corrosion and they look cool.
Uuugh - The Yamaha NS10 is an industry standard because it has fast timing and sound awful - If it sounds good on them then it sounds good on anything, thats the point of them. You should know that at your age.
Awesome video Rick.   Words could not be more true.  People who get on with this BS drive me crazy.  But I understand why it happens.  What soneone hears is completely biases based on what they know or see regarding the source in question.  In Mix With The Masters JJP said how much 24.44.1 sounds MUCH  better than 24.48 and he can tell the difference every time.   I literally laughed out loud.  I believe that he actually believes this is true.  BUT...in a blind test I would bet my life he or anyone else could ever tell.  Most of these people also spend most of their time talking about music and gear rather than making it as well.\n\nAnyways.  Great video as alwsys.  There internet needs more videos like this to combat all the silliness and misinformation.
I think 66% is pretty good, I’m impressed.\nIt looks like definitely she can hear a difference. Some tracks can even sound “more pleasant” to the ear when compressed, think of a filtered picture. So the fact that she didn’t guess right doesn’t mean that she couldn’t tell the difference
Thanks, that was really insightful - could you also cover the other formats and what their purpose is? MP3/ACC/OGG
I think its all about the mood created, example: I don't like Jazz or Trumpet players,.. BUT!!! every time I listen to a MILES DAVIS recording,... I get blown away,... something he was able to do with music (tones, frequency's, timing, meters, dissonance, silence, quiet sounds, loud sounds,... ect.) is just mind blowing to me.
There's always going to be a difference between an mp3 and a .wav. To say otherwise would be to lie to yourself. You can't fool nature's law. \n\nHowever, as to which one sounds better is all in the ear of the beholder. I personally like the YouTube version of Meshuggah's Rational Gaze better than right off the album.\n\nSue me.
I dont believe many people could tell the difference between 44.1k and 96k after mastering but definately MP3 especially on a large system with big subwoofers and extended highs. I have found most headphones arent the same in this sense for some reason.
All I know is this: there is something where I hear the instruments very clearly defined, not a one lump of sounds, and in digital world this mostly happens when I listen to 24/96 music.
So true story. But on the compression artefacts on mp3, doesn't that require a different skillset when to isolate those when listening? I once listened to an indept analysis of compressed files on a loudnessconvention of EBU by thomas Lund. He inverted a compressed track and combined it with the original one. What remained was the difference between the two. It was a pretty grusome distortion, which would lead to listening fatigue. i know from own experience that 128 kb files suffer in the high regions, especially when pushed to loud. Ofcourse encoding quality has an effect. Your opinion please?
So I know this bass player who always turns his volume up crazy high at gigs. I think it’s because of his hearing. He’s in his 50s and the rest of the band are in their 20s and 30s. Is that possible or is he just a show boater?
I’m sorry but what a bunch of pseudo science crap. Just a computer soundcard + (cheap?) headphones. Try it in real life with a decent DAC and amp and good set of speakers in a nice room, then what do you hear? If you only use your smartphone and earplugs and Spotify, sure you won’t notice
The mp3 files are not noticeable when I hear electronic, pop, hip hop. But Rock, Classical, DnB, Jazz, or somethig with a huge orchestration I can hear diferences between quality.
Really liking this kind of content, Rick. Dispelling misconceptions gives me a real charge and fuels my musical endeavors more than all the reading about xyz products etc ever could.
I've been enjoying and learning from these videos for some time. Thank you, Rick--I should subscribe, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to keep up.  But a few points with respect to this one. \n\nThis seems to have become a wide ranging discussion as to the audio quality of MP3s.  \nThe first point I would make about this is that different is not the same as inferior.  There are a lot of audiophiles that prefer the sound of vinyl--they're not wrong about that--it's what they prefer.  (BTW--what's with all of this criticism of audiophiles?  I'm not one, but I have to note that they are maybe the most avid purchasers of music. What kind of business considers its best customers stupid?)\n\nI think what this test shows is that there's a difference in quality.  In every case, she was able to choose one as superior--she heard a difference.  I suspect a recording will in most cases sound best on the technology it was engineered for.  If it's 320bit, 320bit will sound best.  Criticizing and artists choice of medium is about the same as criticizing his/her melodic choices.\n\nHaving said that, I have no doubt that 128bit MP3s are objectively inferior, and I believe that their prevalence has dumbed down music consumers and the industry.  Harmonies and voicings are much simpler than in the 60s-80s and counterpoint has all but disappeared from pop music (see video why is modern pop music so terrible).  I am hopeful that higher bit rates will lead to better music.  I think that's the only way for this business to recover--Despite all of the great musicians active today (and there are a lot), kids today don't appreciate music the way we did.
Thankyou!!! I’ve been saying this to people for years myself.. \nto think of the money people waste
Let me point out that the mp3 test she took is flawed for a number of reasons. \n\nFor example, listening to a sample for the second time *will* alter your memory of the previous one. We also filter things we already heard as soon as they repeat, with varying intensity depending on what it is. And, we tend to look for details in the wrong places when consciously comparing them sequentially (unfortunatelly it's almost impossible to compare sounds simultanously).\nNot to mention that memory gets altered slightly everytime we access it, so listening to a sample of a song we know has an impact on our response to it, especially the first time.\n\nI liked your video, but you presented a question about one subject and showed and argument for your opinion which is a little unrelated.\nPeople can have a better or worse experience due to slight differences in sound quality, and they might even not be able to pinpoint it, since sound is so subjective. So in my opinion, talking about audio file compression is a separate subject.\n\nBut on THAT subject, I think you focused too much on the high-frequencies compression, when I believe you actually know that mp3 does a lot more. Personally, what bothers me most is usually in the lower bands, or when the music is too busy and loud that the original limiting gets very distorted.\n\nJust my two cents.
I could easily tell the difference on my phone speaker, compression algorithms have very distinct sound signatures especially in the way they reproduce sibilance. you can look up an example of all the sound frequencies thats removed from an mp3 and use it to train your ears on what to look for in various compression systems.
Interesting video. Snobbish audiophiles remind of people who claim to know good wine. I wonder how well they'd be able to identify wines if we switched labels and price tags, etc.
From working/recording as a musician in well known studios in London, and speaking as an audiophile myself, I've learnt that its the 'guy/gal behind the desk' that makes or breaks the outcome of any recording. After speaking with many engineers about this topic over the years, the general consensus is that it is not the technology itself that defines the quality of the outcome, but the IMPLENTATION of the technology. I own a Linn/Naim/Epos system at home and it is what you could call a high resolution system. I own some '70s digital master vinyl recordings that sound simply sublime, '70s analogue vinyl that sounds awful, modern digital that sounds awful, modern analogue that sounds sublime plus everything in between. All of it comes down to the skill of the engineer. A badly placed mic will sound second rate no matter what it's plugged into - Garbage in, Garbage out as they say.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe quick A/B demos Michelle took part in don't really offer much help though. I used to work occasionally in a specialist HiFi store back in the '80s and a first generation 14bit CD player would 'wow' customers compared to a cultured vinyl front end due to its artificially bright, forward tonal balance. But like a TV with superficially bright, dazzling colours, it soon becomes fatiguing to experience. Long term listening is required for a better judgement. Its the sign of a poor system if you're reaching for the remote to flick tracks - a good system should be compelling to listen to, rather than 'impressive'.\n\nUltrasonic frequencies are known to resonate with audible frequencies which is often cited as one of the reasons for analogue having a more 'natural' sound than digital. Just because we cannot 'hear' above 22k, it doesn't necessarily mean we cannot 'hear' the effects of >22k on what we CAN hear <22k. At the other end of the spectrum, subsonic frequencies have been shown to affect mood for example. So I think in regard to data compression, it's risky to chuck out duplicated - (superfluous (?)) or inaudible frequencies with these data compression algorithms, as these frequencies affect our brains processing of what we hear in ways which we do not perhaps fully understand. How many harmonics are produced by that single violin note? No doubt many duplicated by the French horn and snare drum? Do they interact on an inaudible, but vital way?\n\nWe humans are very clever with our algorithms, but we can't shortcut or outwit nature. Our perception of music through hearing processes evolved over hundreds of thousands years is perhaps too complex to be quantified or fully understood, let alone managed by relatively primitive, juvenile technology. Personally I'm convinced we need as faithful a reproduction of all frequencies inside and outside the audible range no matter how many are duplicated simultaneously, as that is what would happen in a real world, live, acoustic environment with no electronic processing whatsoever, regardless of bit/sampling rate. No disrespect to Michelle or anyone else, but through a high resolution system - perhaps headphones in front of a computer screen is not ideal? - a data compressed version of a full resolution recording is, to my ears at least, clearly inferior, in ways that cannot be 'measured' eg. emotional communication. Does that compressed version of an Eddie Van Halen solo make you want to jump up and play air guitar? Or Gorecki's Symphony #3 make you cry? In my experience, no. These factors cannot be measured, but they are demostrably real, and surely the very escence ie. the whole point of music in the first place? Data compression works, but does it? No point in chucking the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nIts interesting that in studios I've worked in which have absolute state of the art equipment, when the production team and their musician friends are working on a pet music project for fun in their own time, with all that equipment at their disposal, they often dust off the old analogue 1/2 in the corner because there's just something about it.
Take a .wav and stack it with the phase inverted high quality .mp3 to render the audio track of only what IS cut out in the .mp3. Its a fun little demo and everyone should do it with their favorite piece of music. Depending on the song and style, it will be mostly transient energy and extra low bass reverb that is left. Sometimes funny bits of vocals come through, But you typically have to boost the levels a lot to really hear much at all. The problem is most streaming and internet audio comes across at 128 or maybe 256 and you can still hear those artifacts on metallic sounds. Ask yourself what is about 12-14Khz and it's mostly metals. This is because real metals produce such complex overtones. Wood instruments and most electronic instruments . . . it won't make much of a difference.
I listen to CDs 😕
Got 3 outta 6. The 3 i missed were in 320. Most of que wav tracks had some kind of liveliness to them that the others didn't. I noticed that especially when there were strings, spacious reverbs and sub bass sine waves
I got 4 out of 6, didn't select the 128K mp3 at all. \n\nThe Coldplay sample was horrible, over produced, over excited, over compressed. 10 seconds was enough.
Offering it in a lossless format means people can choose to transcode to whatever format they want. For example 100kbit/s OPUS (try some ABX testing with that!).\n Transcoding MP3 to other lossy formats can lead to audible artifacts that wouldn't be there with the original source.
T you Rick is it possible that a lot of people can hear the diference?? YES!!!  Is it possible that a lot of people can't hear the diference?? YES!!! in some days my computer makes a background noise trough all the soundcard, and some days-hopeflly the majority-don't, some days i'm tired and some other i'm not, and yes it makes a difrence, have you heard placebo effects???? ...these to say Thank you Rick i've been learning a lot with you, and by now i've learned some things that search for perfection that is not on our reach., i'm producing in propellerheads reason/samson resolv and, as the time passed, is my knowledge that really makes the diference bcause when i bounce it outthere and play it wherever outside it sounds intirelly diferently from place to place, so audioFiles or audioFooles, cd or cassete recorder blá blá blá..., 50% 4 each other.. again Thank You very much Rick we all are intitled to our opinion and yes i've understood yours, better some days,  i'm the best and others just a fool you know???so let them speack wathever..
Jazz in mp3 format totally sucks. For that matter any digital format is inferior to vinyl for jazz. You listen to jazz on vinyl (with good headphones) that hasn't touched the digital realm at all, strictly analog, and you can hear the overtones on the bass, the saxophonist's fingers moving on the keys, the drummer's foot moving on the high hat stand. You are in the room with the band. \n\nI ripped all my CDs into iTunes as mp3s and noticed a digital distortion caused by the overtones in the ride cymbal. A hissing, crackling sound. You can hear it on a lot of jazz uploaded on YouTube. I went back and ripped my whole collection as Apple Lossless and the hiss is gone. Fuck mp3s.
''...their ears and their experience give them the taste to know what sounds good''  Absobloodylutely spot on.
Check out the Absolute Sound for some chuckles. You can spend huge dollars for low-oxygen cables and even cable risers that keep your speaker runs off of the floor because that would muddy the sound(?!}. Actually, I think  in light of the current 'good enough'  state of the art (ex: cell phones and poor connections), a 192k mp3 is certainly good enough to get the message across while I'm listening on my earbuds on the train with lots of other noise going on. I even sometimes mix with just earbuds. This from a guy who owns Avalon, Tubetech, Fearn and other expensive gear but thats another story.  Cheers!
When i listen to music im familiar with i can clearly hear a distinction between 192 kbps and 320 kbps, when i listen for the difference between 320 kbps and 1140 kbps id like to think im hearing a difference, but not nearly as distinct as 192 vs 320, and this is with headphones, without the headphones and music that im highly familiar with it would probably be even tougher.
i only got 2/6 and chose the 320 kbps on the other 4.
this is good! thanks Tim Bell of Grace Music Academy
As an audio file I applaud your candid truthfulness and finally somebody has said exactly what I've been saying for years. Thank you.
I used to spend so much time researching the difference between WAVs and 320kb MP3's and I really, really wanted to be able to hear the difference. I soon accepted the fact I couldn't at all and that it didn't matter. Although I still prefer having WAV files to MP3s lol, I like to believe it's better quality to my ears I guess.
Burning down the BS!
I was so stoked at doing this test. Turns out it's the well known NPR test me and my son already did a while back :)
In my own tests, mp3 at any bitrate has flaws in reproducing transients, especially in high frequencies. The treble sound becomes indistinct, hazy, the opposite of crisp.  I don't notice this on every track.  It depends on the material.  128k has fairly awful treble sound.  I noticed very little improvement from 192k to 256k, above that no difference at all. (320k is a waste).  So it's not just about frequency range, although it's true 128k is low-pass filtered at 16kHz, 160k at about 20kHz.\n\nI also tested AAC+, and this format is vastly better.  The ogg format is nearly as good.  Above about 120k AAC+ I cannot tell the difference from uncompressed WAV at all.  Crisp, clear treble transients.
Classical composers tend to peak between 50 -70 also. Could also have to do with the maturity of hearing
Hey Rick, fan of the channel. However, would like to point out the following flaw with the test the lady did. I took the test myself a year ago. Consider this: is the setup used for the test capable to reproduce higher quality digital files with higher quality at analog end? If the dac makes a bad job of doing so then the test is by enlarge irrelevant. All components of the sound reproduction chain are important and the weakest bit is what you are hearing in the end.
There is an excellent article at xiph.org called 24/192 Music Downloads...and why they make no sense that sheds considerably light on sample rates, bit depths, etc. here: https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html
I am not audiophile and neither a audio-fool, but this is not a fair test as I see it! First computer DAC are frequently terrible and headphone sets are as well BAD on average! So... I think that you need good equipment to take advantage of lossless files, I agree that 320Kb mp3 is fine for most of the people but also think that if you listen this test through a good equipment most of people will guess more than 50% for sure! Because you can't find low bass and high frequencies that you skin feels through average equipments... I can't listen anything behind 18800Khz but I can feel it I'm sure!
Do I need an uncompressed file when I'm recording, editing and producing audio? Absolutely. Do I need it during playback? Probably not. There are a few factors that come into play in this argument though. Certain types of music may be (however unlikely) more affected by data compression than others. If there are more complex overtones and tremendous dynamic range present in the audio track, there may be a greater chance for a perceptible difference. Messing with the dynamics? Possibility of artifacts? Perhaps. At 128 kbps, there is a clear perceptible degradation of fidelity but at 320 kbps, I think the chances are very slim, even in a proper listening environment (Yes. That means good quality loudspeakers in an acoustically treated room and not headphones). Maybe 1 out of a thousand tracks will be perceptibly affected but one thing is certain. The fear of quality loss is far greater than any actual loss when it comes to 320 kbps mp3. On the consumer end, pretty much no one (audiophiles included) will be able to tell the difference in a realistic listening scenario.
I am here only for the comments ;-).
I got 3 out of 6 correct in the NPR test. Really 320 kbps and WAV file do sound similar. Listened on ATH M30.
I am hear all the difference clearly, but anyway i can't sing on the pitch. -_-
Watching her take that test gave me the idea that you could play all the tracks from your new album in random order, and try and have her match up the titles with the tracks and see how many she gets right.
The source content quality is key as is the monitoring devices being used. If the source material is not recorded, mixed or mastered well, the differences in many cases will be negligible when processed down to 320kbps or even lower. I have heard plenty of bad mixes that were dense and squashed to death played back at 44.1 that didn't sound any different when processed at varying bit rates all the way down to 128. The better the source content, the more noticeable the differences particularly with acoustic music with complex frequency content, ambient space and extensive dynamic range. I was a Spotify subscriber for quite a while and streamed at 320k until I switched to Tidal which offers uncompressed streaming. I also went back and played CD's in my collection and was shocked how much I had been conditioned to accept what I had been missing. Music I had listened to for years suddenly had more depth. I could hear more detail in reverb tails, more shimmer in the cymbal decays, and a deeper overall soundstage. I am 57 years old, and even with my well worn ears, I can clearly hear a difference dependent upon musical genre and quality of the original source content.
In the early 90s, I read of a study, in recording engineer magazine, as I recall. Maybe it was mix, or another fairly  technical periodical. Some Japanese researchers did an a/b test,of digital vs analogue recordings. Instead of asking subjects to identify what they were hearing they measured brainwave responses. After 2o minutes, neocortex hemispheres went into an entrainment ( usually one is dominant,and this switches back and forth cyclically) mode. Digita; source never stimulated this entrainment response. I have not found any follow up on this.
Have you ever listened to Jim O'rourke? Im really interested in his style of composing like in The Visitor and another album called Eurkea.
Useless!
Great video
Champion 👌🏽
Rick ... I hear ya!
Solution: FLAC
Why bother with lossy compression ( a flac is around 30 megabytes) when you can get a 400 gb microsd card? Just makes absolutely no sense to use those any longer.
Just an observation about your use of terminology: 44.1Khz is a sample rate whilst 320 kbp/s is a bitrate: the two things are different and not mutually exclusive. The latter will usually (although not exclusively) also be 44.1 kHz. Apologies if anyone else has already made this point, but there were 578 other comments at the time of writing....
Hi Rick. I too went to audio engineering school around 2004. We were extremely fortunate to have Mr. Rupert Neve come and give us a presentation specifically on sound quality. The short version is they studied brain activity (PET scan I think) as a person listed to the same song from record, CD and mp3. The results were very interesting. Records showed the highest brain activity followed by CD and mp3. In fact as the quality decreased, parts of the brain that fire when you are irritated stared to show up. The thought is the human ear can't hear above roughly 20K so CDs have a brick wall filter at 22.5k and MP3s do something similar. My understanding is records go all the way up to 96 k. They determined that although we can't hear the extra frequencies, they think our brain perceives them and knows they are there. The brain kind of fills in the blanks so to speak. When those frequencies were removed, irritation part of the brain started showing more and more activity. Just thought it was kind of relevant to the topic.
I had an experience recently re-mastering an old analogue recording that featured a synthesised EMS Synthi style falling whistle, and it suddenly appeared in the most unmusical way. I had to view the audio spectrum to see that it started several bars earlier way up at 18kHz+ then get my 14 year old daughter to listen and tell me how that part was balanced. She reported that at a nominal listening volume the whistle was piercing for her at that frequency, and I was able to paint in a 6dB drop, which fixed it.\n\nAcuity of hearing doesn't simply relate to frequency, but to differentiation. Many older people (I'm 57 - is that old?) begin to lose the ability to pick one sound out from another, because of damage and wear to the cilia in the cochlea. That does affect which frequencies we can hear, because you lose cilia, but it can also affect the signals that are sent by the cochlea for processing in the brain if the microtubules in the cilia are affected by degradation caused by age or illness. \n\nLike Rick says, our brains are very good at compensating, but only up to a point. It becomes especially apparent when dealing with new sounds or combinations of sounds, and we can hear this in some recorded music. For example, Frank Zappa's later remixes of his early work were really very poor and have had to be remastered again. He was quite ill when those mixes were done, either by him overseeing them or actually hands on.\n\nTurns out I can only hear up to about 14kHz on a good day, but if I'm tired or my ears have been abused for a few hours by too much work, it can fall drastically.\n\nThe good news is that there are lots of spectral tools that can report on dB values at all the frequencies, and if you are dealing with known instruments and gear experience will go a long way. Also, there is very little in the post 10 kHz range that is not directly harmonically connected to the lower frequencies, so unless you are constantly pushing the higher frequencies it'll probably be OK.\n\nAge sucks, but technology saves.
but random guessing would've been 33.3% she got twice that and i got 100% bad video
No one uses CD players any more? Last time I looked CDs were responsible for about 50% of the music industry's revenue - significantly more than downloads. I wonder what people are doing with all these CDs if they don't have a CD player.
I'm sorry.. I'm an audiophile and I've been all about music quality for as long as I can remember. I can say yes, I can tell the difference in quality. With good headphones, the difference between WAV and mp3 are noticeable when you listen for it. The difference I hear is that the high ends get washed out and there is dramatically less bass. Also, with the mp3 file, there is far less spread; It sounds narrow. Hearing for the spread is kinda the only way to hear any difference between 320kpbs and WAV.
dude, the difference between 128 and wave, heard on a PA, is absolutely massive. don't believe me? go try it.
You are comparing the data bit rate (320 kb/s) to a sampling frequency (44.1 KHz).  These are different things.
I did the NPR test and failed miserably (using AKG K271 headphones plugged into a Steinberg UR22 interface).\nInteresingly enough, there is one song where I can reliably identify the 128kbps file and it is the Coldplay one.\nThis song has a lot of high frequency noise (an overamplified kind of sound) which is less apparent in the compressed file.\nThis actually makes the low quality mp3 sound better, which might explain why Michelle picked it.\nWhat do you think, Rick?
Your evidence is presented on Youtube, with its lossy audio compression not taken into account.\nWhat a waste of bandwidth!\nI'm just pleased that I haven't wasted any time listening to it :)
Please make mint oreo and merangue chocolate cake
Same thing here in Canada. It is getting really cold here. But I will still eat popsicles in the dead of winter because I don't care! Btw these look so good!
Hii Jemma can u plzz shows us some more biscuits or something like biscuit rolls or some cake dessert 😋🤗 tht would be great thnxx
omg u can just freeze yogurt! JUST LIKE THAT!! my god, I surely wasted my life till now..... and of course u can wrap the popsicles once they are frozen!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😂 thanks for saving my wasted life TWICE, surely am making this one!!! ❤️
I’m just here drooling over her recipes cause I’m too lazy to make them 😂
I want to study abroad next year in London so if i do go, Im defiantly going to  Crumbs & Doilies!
They look gorgeous 😍
Nice😍
Aw, you posted this about half an hour after my girls begged to watch a video of yours before going to bed. (We found an old one they hadn't seen yet.) They're 6 & 4 and love cake videos, yours especially.
That paper wrapping gave me asmr
I love your cooking!!It's awesome and delicious. I LOVE YOU!!^^♡♡♡♡
Please make more cakes!!!!
My d
Jemma, your videos are so helpfull and Tasty 😋 💖💖
Was anyone else worrying about her pretty white shirt getting purple stains from the blueberries? 😮😅 x
Do MACARONS! :)
Love this idea!!
These are your popsicles! ( beats the wisk ) 😂😂😂
Yummy 😋😋😋 Kisses from my channel 💕😘😘😘💕
Yogurt is gross
Hello Jemma, could you please make Raffaello cupcakes? :) x
mmm yummy! thanks for sharing the recipe, jemma! ♡
#YUM
Jemma you have nice hair
my mouth watering
this*
First
Look really good....
soo nice!!!!
I'm sorry I love Jemma but who bites and chews and ice lolly
Yuuuuummmmmmmmmyyyyyyyy
Do these not cristallize? Every time I try freezing yogurt, it always creates small ice crystals that make it horrible to eat. How do I avoid that?
Can you do this with coconut?
I'm glad u made this,in Florida it's still in the mid 80 degrees outside and I really need something to cool down!
RIP blueberry at 0:30
Thank you Jemma!!! ❤️❤️❤️ it's always summer in Singapore here 😂 so thank you for this recipe
Heyy I really love watching you \nCan you show us how to make hot cookie dough pleaseee\nThanks x
Please made a biscoff cake:) They looks so good.
Please show us how to make the cookies and cream oreo cake!
I love your shirt! It looks like vanilla cream or pudding with the seeds scattered throughout!
I love your videos. Even though summer is over it's still a good idea to make those. I have a nephew who is a year old and he is currently teething. He is in allot of pain and cold things such as ice lollies helps to sooth his gums and mouth. I might have to try your recipes for my nephew.
Where can you get those icecream molds. Gotta have them.
Thanks for the recipe. Love you jemma.I live in Thailand l like watching you make a lot of sweets.
Those look delish!  And, you really did only use 4 ingredients!  Nice job Jemma!!
Will you be attempting chocolate macarons at some point? (Not macaroons) they are tricky to get right but I think you will get there. You could even do them as part of a cupcake or something. Like the oreo cupcakes but with chocolate macarons. Anyway, keep up the good work. The snickers brownie and Portuguese custard tarts videos are my favourites.
Yes for me it's sunny, i am living in Caribbean !!! And cold what does it mean ?? 😄, i try your loly pop tomorrow , thank you, i send you peace of SUN 🌞🌞🌞
This should not be trending
Yogurt.\nyogurt.\n_yogurt_\n*yogurt*\n\nsorry,you yog *hurt* my feelings with that spelling.
Made me cringe watching you BITE the popsicle... Besides that, thank you, I'm going to try and make this!!
thank you so much! I'm just trying to eat quite a bit healthier here in Hawaii, so it was nice to see this recipe to know that I don't necessarily have to give up a monthly dessert. Thanks again very excited to try this!
yup! it is always summer here in Singapore!
Does anyone know what the US conversions are??? TIA
How about some more/ new Halloween recipes? Are you going to have a Halloween skit this year?
Nice video I'll make those when I  have a party or friends gathering
OMG 😙😙Jemma you did amazing with the popsicle and with every dessert💓💯 I can not wait to be like you and meet you someday you 😍inspire me to do what I do best and that is to bake🎂🍦🍩
Omg these look AMAZING!! Also I really like the look of your kitchen Jemma! I have just started a baking channel myself and would love it if anyone could check it out and say hello😌
I love the way you read our minds ( e.g.  can add or less sugar, use other fruit...) you answer our questions b4 we ask them. Lol
yummm and its so hot here in south america :p
Roseburg Oregon was 45 degrees this morning it's only about 51 degrees now I'm not happy with the cold weather already LOL I miss summer went warmer fall weather
Cupcake jemma it's my birthday on Sunday the 15th.

Thank you for this Jemma. We're heading into Summer in South Africa so I will definitely be making this!
Today in Spain (at least in the south where I live) we were  at 27°C. So this are perfect
We’re stuck in Eternal summer here ://
Yes its perpetual summer here in Singapore, so yup, I would be making these for summer which is erm everyday...
Can i come to your shop Plz?

Love this video xxx
Hello sweetie.  I love all your videos, and I don't comment usually because I can't eat most of what you make because I don't like the flavor of butter or sugar.  I know, I'm really weird.  Anyway, thank you for this recipe because I would have never thought to make these!
CupcakeJemma where did you get this popsickes molds. You said you bought them online could you please leave the link on your video I'll appreciate it!!! Love this recipe x
Looks like lightly used tampons to me. Just saying.
Made your Oreo cupcakes for a bake sale today :) they were delicious (if I do say so myself) but all down to the perfect recipe!
I noticed the bird tattoo and the one on the towel @ 00:35. Then i realized that it was a cupcake jemma towel. Plz tell us more
No way you did that blueberry squishing in that gorgeous top and didn't get it covered in blueberry splatter...
How about a pumpkin spice cupcake recipe? #Halloween.. #WinterIsComing

Why is someone who is dairy free an idiot?
Is vanilla paste different from vanilla extract?
every time i watch this channel i get so hungry and want to eat what they made
Now technically... none of us should suck the tit of another animal into adulthood (or ever).
I live in Switzerland but never ate that
Hiya guys love your channel. Would you be able to make baba ganoush at some point? I love it and would really like to see your version. It's good as a dip but I love it with spicy roast lamb too thanks 😉
in Chile we call that brazo de reina, which means queen's arm
Any chance of you guys making Wagamamas Firecracker Chicken one day?
Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Have you guys ever tasted woodruff before? (or in german Waldmeister) If not you have to try it its a unique taste that i never found somewhere else.\nI also would like to see you come up with a recipe for it.
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
 You're knocking off my nuts \n*Ben giggles silently*

VEGETARIAN WEEK PLEASE I BEG!
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
Jeremy you prick
No sprig of mint??? -gasp-

Ummmmm Casper where's the second verse!!!!!
Am I the only one who notices the shadows?

Filthy Frank lore and philosophy Thank You
...or the history of the hipster. Anatole Broyard wrote an essay titled A Portrait of the Hipster and a decade later Norman Mailer wrote an essay titled The White Negro in 1957; these essays, of course, making note of the changing dynamics of youth culture and the ways in which some racial and ethnic groups appropriate culture for their aesthetic pleasure. Jump forward into the late 1990s and the Hipster is born alongside an anticapitalist movement among young working professionals who call themselves alternative and subsequently listen to indie rock, punk, and pop. Later the Hipster goes through a major ideological change and redirects its style that adopts the environmental movement and gives rise to the organic/natural health craze.

3000B.C. is about when the first writing or sign of language dates back historically, but sciencist say our Earth is about 5billion years old. So why don't we have any form of writing or language, story about people that dates back further? Could global warming have happened to our species multiple times in the past which could mean its enevitable or we keep getting try after try until we understand the meaning of life and living, or the Christian religions book of Revelations is seriously going to happen...

Hey I’m subscribed and I’m extremely offended
I'd like to know the science behind the comments below. How come so many subscribers started to comment on Filthy Franks? It's almost like a viral commentary. Why did it happened and how can it be explained? Why did so many subscribers decided to follow the lead on previous comments on Filthy Frank, and how this comment movement became a thing. Thanks
Where is Google x and other groups that are similar headed? What kind of programs are these groups in active pursuit over? Could theses groups inspire governments to take a comparative approach? Do governments contribute or help fund these groups of technological improvement, if they don't why not?
Filthy Frank please!!
I am a pharmacist and I've always wanted to know the answer to this question: How does the government decide what schedule a new controlled substance should be. I once asked this question at a pharmaceutical meeting where the drug in question was a schedule 5 drug for epilepsy. The presenter told me the most outrageous story. He said addictiveness studies are done by giving KNOWN drug users the study drug to ABUSE, and then they are asked what they think the street value would be, ranking it with questions like would you rather use this drug or Xanax? Now I have no idea if that's true because I don't trust pharmaceutical sales reps further than I can throw them, but I realized I had no idea how the process actually DID go if that wasn't it. I think that would be an interesting video.
Do a video on all the people propping Filthy frank! Filthy frank is uninteresting, but these folks sure are! Thanks!
*BEST VIDEO IDEA* Where did the applause originate? #holyvox

I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose.

Can she even write a bad song? Next time I'm just hitting Like before I even listen.
Lyrics:\n\nThere's a hole in the dry wall, still not fixed. I just haven't gotten around to it and besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps. Say wish you could find some way to live to be so hard on myself, so why is it easy for everyone else. I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow, I guess.\n\nAnd I never do it but it's not a joke. I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone. Is it real or a dream, which is worse, can you help me? I just wanted to go to sleep.\n\nWhen I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. There's no one left between myself and me.\nBut when I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights, there's no one left between myself and me.\n\n\n\nJB's new single is amaze y'all. Enjoy it. I sure am. 😊
I'm actually gonna fly from Moscow to Paris just to see her show in November...
This album is gonna be amazing.
Turn Out The Lights debuted at #9 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV1dMqeb4_U&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=9
It's Julien. Of course I'm gonna love it
Only person in my life that makes me feel something and I'm tired of feeling nothing. ♥️🏳️‍🌈
Darn. My life’s changed forever since I found Julien, and each song touches my soul in places I didn’t know existed before... Thank you.
This is an entirely new level! Can't wait to hear her new album!
The tears are real son
Omg I wasn't prepared for this
And I thought I couldn't love her more
She makes me want to be a better person
I know its not her style, but im a sucker for at 2:30 if a full band came in and just thrashed the outro
So lovely, u are are my favorit artist Julien.
No one inspires me more than Julien does. Absolutely cannot wait to see her next week.
When you ugly cry into a pillow for a solid hour, but it’s the best part of your day
Julien, you just get me. Thank you.
This song is a masterpiece <3
once again I clapped physical claps
A new sooooong!
I think my spotify and youtube have a syc, because I was listen Julien and YT recommend me this 💙
2017s answer to 2016s Your Best American Girl by Mitski
I've never found a song that explains why I don't go to sleep at night so well. Thanks Julien as always
She's just phenomenal. She can't make a bad song.
I thought this was brilliant, and then I listened to it with new headphones ... now brilliant doesn't seem good enough.
24 forest guards didn't like the video.
D A M N Jesse Cale music taste be poppin h a r d
this is art...
Oth anyone 😀😀😀
Her songs would be great on Shameless
imagine a parody video that's just a cat chasing a laser
SO glad Jesse Cale recommended this song. I'm obsessed.
I was incredibly excited for this recording. But it would seem some studio person thought she needed her vocals layered. Please listen to the incredible live performance and stop trying to fix perfection... for fucks sake. Sorry for being a downer.
i can't wait to see her on the 28th. what an angel
Slowly it start to sound similar...
well I just had 3:35 minutes of goosebumps
really wished I could have seen her open for jason isbell at the ryman the other night! she's amazing.
Beautiful song! Masterful video! Great job Julien and crew! Wish you all the best!
In portuguese, we have some expressions to descrive fellings, things, in this case music, that we fell like overwhelming. Its:«do caraças!». the music of little Julien Baker is... do caraças.
I hope she doesn't sprain her ankle with all that running.
I like how her latest 2 vids have just been her walking around singing
Y'all, I don't know if I'm emotionally prepared for this new album
There's so many reasons why it hurts to watch her perform and listen
She is something special
ya boi is crying now
I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow I guess.
Got to see her when she played in New Zealand! I'm hoping she tours this album here again, she's the best female artist in the world.
The use of 35mm color film here is something from out of a dream. It’s subconscious and unreal. The shot of Julien coming out of the smoke before she starts running is my favorite.
I love her and so happy shes releasing new music.
I remember the first time I heard it live. Damn, I had goosebumps everywhere. I love that song. I love Julien. Can't wait for the new cd to come out.
Me vs Maradona vs Elvis. So much Brand New in this song. Love it
I like how the wire is not actually burning its way through the place, but is just being pulled while the end has a sparkling effect to it :D\nthis song tho <3
We need a song with Julien Baker and Dallas Green
Oh my gosh! Even the sound of her footsteps in the beginning gave me goosebumps.
My god this woman can do no wrong. Simply amazing! Whoever disliked this video; FOR SHAME MAN!!!
in my Julien-trance, forever...
She's an angel sounds so beautiful Love her voice gives me goosbumps
It's in 4:3 so you sure as hell no it's artistic ;)
Pretty awesome, at the end 2017 it was a good year 😍
Recently discovered Juliens music by accident. Now I need this album
I love every new song more than the last. The only downside of an artist like Julien is that every re-listen to one of her songs will never be as good as that first emotional journey, one where you could never be  sure of what was about to hit you. It still hits you of course, but I wish I could go into every song having never listened to it before.
Ouch oof owie my emotions
Woke up to a notification about this video (southern hemisphere). DAY MADE.
Goosebumps. Pure art. Oct 27th please hurry.
Magical sound
I just said goodbye to the plan for the day.
♡ !!

AHHHW WOW :O
Ofuk.jpg
holy crap! Although she writes kinda sad songs they always fit for every kinda mood....
wtf shes a crack
Damn this is overall boring. The music is so slow and unoriginal and the lyrics try too hard to display significance...not to mention the video is just a number of cliched scenes edited together
When you hear that guitar in the intro you know it's gonna be fire
Man new music everywhere (Julien Baker, The Front Bottoms, Knuckle Puck, Beck) loving fall so far
i'm not cry, i'm not cry 😢😭
Beautiful. A perfect song.
How is she running after that sprained ankle?
what camera is used?
This video was shot next to my house
Love it, love it....LOVE it!
The mother Fucking GOAT. Best music I've heard in the last few years.

This is an old video. He was only joking. Tyrese is a cry baby and a diva.
This black Ass peice of shit have degraded the black woman on so many levels.  Im a proud black woman but i will spit on this peice of shit.  U sexy as A Motherfuck!
They playing
Now I know he is mad but that album was good. He is just being mean I hate to see these two brothas at each other's throats like this.
Dwayne Johnson it's about time you addressed his black ass. Not only does his independent music sound like shit but he looks like a big black piece of long shit while he's dissing black  women and going on his senseless rants that nobody cares about. Thank you Dwayne  we know he's not worth your time but that's what he wanted  your time since he's not working  that's all he has is time. Keep winning Mr.Johnson
This is an old video and The Rock was joking.
Thanks Dwayne. All he does is diss black women. Fuck this nigga. Black as his black ass IS. He got some fucking nerve.
If my love for The Rock was slowly fading. The love has been restored after watching this. Shout out to The Rock boo!
To fucking funny mr. Johnson is hilarious
Lmfao damn he's childish and not the mother fucker at the end😂😂
Nigga, i don't give a f**k about that little cat fight between you two; but real talk .... that Black Rose album is fire ...... WTF is The Rock talking about.  I've never really been up on Tyrese; but that album is Da Shit .... not baby shit.  So 'pause big boy and go back and check  that Shame out (classic R&B) and play that When We Make Love for your lady with her eyes closed ........ straight fire my dude.
Tyrees, need to stop you seriously got issues. Start to believe the story about you abusing your daughter. You and Rock was cool and then you going to start shit because, of a movie, stop the bullshit life is to short for nonsense✌🏾😜
EXCUSE ME Rocks wife, I must say u have 1 fine Ass Husband.   Get that show on tv as quick as possible so ur fans can watch u weekly.  Keep pumping that Iron cause that body is the Rock! Cute face ball head makes u hotter!   I hope u have Luv scenes!
Tyrese still tryna promote his 2015 Album 😢😢😢
The rock is the king of petty y'all must not have seen WWF LOL
Tio asqueroso. Tu a Tyrese no le llegas ni a la suela del zapato. Y si es totalmente cierto lo unico q buscas es romper la bonita familia en la que tu solo eres un intruso. Alma negra , ser oscuro con disfraz de humano. Tyrese tiene luz en su alma LUZ DE ESTRELLA QUE A TI TE ESCUECE POR QUE ERES PURA OSCURIDAD. PURO EGO SOBERBIO ENVIDIOSO EGOISTA Y MANIPULADOR. QUE SE TE VE EL PLUMERO. BUENO MAS BIEN SE TE VEN LOS CUERNOS DE SER OSCURO. de lo que llevas tatuado eso eres.
He's my moms face
This guys supposed to be rich, yet he lives in a trailer??
Guys I just looked up that album it came out 2 years ago apparently.
It's all for publicity
What in the actual fuck is happening
Dwayne is over rated. Fuck you dwayne
THAT ALBUM IS FROM 2015 WTF IS THIS????????????
DAM ROCK YOU WENT IN LIKE  THE BAD MF YOU ARE👍👍👍👍
Even if this was a joke.  We all know any album tyrone puts out is donkey shit
He needs to get his motherfucker lessons from the boondocks asap😂😂
CAN U, SMELLLLLLLLL WHAT TYRESE IS, COOKINGGGG??  A BIGG PEACE OF BLACK SOFT DOGGSHITT!!!
This was almost 4 years ago in 2015 when they were cool. I'm sure he was joking lol
I'm just a little disappointed that it wasn't ended with a if you smell what The Rock is cookin
The Rock is in WWF promo mode right now. Tyrese you not fucking with this lol
I ain't even hating or anything but I just hear it right now and I agree with Dwayne😂😂😂
Fuck black roses go up my ass
Y'all messy... This is old
DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK JUST COOKED? \n\n\n\n\n\nYep its called Tyrese on a platter with a black Rose 😂🤣😂🤣😂 \nTyrese gon leave ppl tf alone.
Where is his beard
Cryrese messing with the Rock's $. He's gonna get his ##Candyass beat. 😂😂 Y'all wrong for putting this OLD video out to be taken out of context.
The only really good song is addict I'll admit but the rest was garbage besides 2 or 3 more songs
Lol. He has a point. I only liked one song.
Lol the Rock gave him the people's mouth lol get his @$$
You can’t disrespect someone from the attitude era bitch ! The great one is still great.
😭😭😭😭
Reminds me of his wrestling days. Don't come for The Rock unless he sends for you! Guess Tyrese just got the smack down! 😂😂😂
The album is typical black homeless crackhead singing 🎤 in a ⛺️
This video is old. Rock was being funny. And was helping Tyrese promote the album. Rock is a lot bigger now. And has a grey beard. Y’all will believe anything.
Smh I like them both but this is really old and he was joking around with tyrese. Rock was filming one of the ff movies as well as filming for the show ballers. It pays to do research y'all. Ppl have to learn to stop burning bridges when your angry with a close buddy.  Idk either one personally but Tyrese went to find this video at great lengths to make it seem like the rock is a horrible guy. Makes you wonder what does this say about Tyrese's character though.
Just beat his ass rock.  Fuck cryrees. AnD Kevin  hart to i hate that bitch bonus punch please 2 for one slap him back on the bus singing for a Pepsi
damn
😭😭😭😭
that was fucked up
😂😂😂
Tyrese is a cry baby bitch
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
🔫🔫🔫🔫😂😂😂😂
😂🤣💯
LMAO. I love Dwayne
I love him
😂
SHOOT
Fuck u rock
ooh my
Yah it price of shit
😂😂😂😂😂💀
Damn lol Tyrese brought out the old school Rock 😂😂😂
Don't fuck with the rock t u not ready.
Go in ROCK YESSSSS THE OL ROCK BACK
This was a joke. Dwayne was filming FF and Ballers at the same time so he was in character.  Cryrese posted it and was laughing a few years ago, and now he tries to flip it and make it seem like Dwayne did this in to be mean.
Was that a joke or what. I really thought they was finished with the B'S Rock and if don't like the guy why did u listen to the album anyway. SMH grown men
Yall. Live talking to me bitches eats this pussy
Hee! Hee! I don't know if Rock is joking or what but this was funny.
Dwayne went OFF!
Didn't black rose come out a while ago?
Everybody know the rock has a beard now lol clearly old when tyrese released black rose witch was last year
This has to be a publicity stunt right? Lol like wtf
Well damn. I bought it last year, got some cute songs but nothing to go crazy over. Aint trash at all.
😳
I tell u what u fine Ass hunk of a man.   U so sweet u have a Beautiful wife Beautiful daughter and im a fan.   Rock i just got to say Dammmmmmmm.,    I Luv It when u talk dirty.  Thats right respond to this dry lip jealous ass man.  FUCK Tyrese.

Mans getting a belly from bare chicken uno
Man got the manboob ya get me
Where's the school uniform and one glove look? I prefer it when you look like a clown. And when are you going to do something other than going to chicken and chip shops. If my son ate at chicken and chip shops like they were Michelin star joints I'd disown him.
My man takes months off and comes back looking like Oprah Winfrey
I'm not a hater at all but my man really does need a trim lol. It's mad having a sick job but donny's in need of a diet now. I saw a comment down below saying he's looking like Big Narstie now. This shit ain't healthy brudda.
Looking like a Nigerian Supply teacher 👩🏽‍🏫
these moroccans must be thinking what is a 12 year old doing here on his own
Looks like he’s gained a few pounds

Teleportation ting, mans here now 😂😂😂
That's such an awesome story.
This animation was amazing.
Love this
This is fucking cool and I appreciate it.
This was such a lovely surprise
Great animation! Where's my vault package at tho? Still haven't gotten it😂
who the hell dislikes this??
Animation and Storytelling are both Ace. One gets the feeling that when Jack (John) really connects with someone, who has a heart as pure as his own, it's friends forever. Not many folks care to remember for a minute what you really want most let alone years. \n🎸🐧💙
Things like these are what makes life worth living.
Wow, what a tale :) Awesome animation!
Cried during that show.
This makes my heart ache for The White Stripes even more, especially since this was the last performance they did. I wish things wouldn't have fallen apart the way they did and that maybe some day by some miracle by the grace of God they can reunite and do even more great things. If Guns N' Roses can manage it, I don't see why The White Stripes can't.
What a very nice little animation. I love it.
I love Conan and I love Jack and Meg
Thank you for the video :)
Jack and Meg need to get back together for just one last gig
This was a beautiful story and video, thanks. :)
This is fucking amazing, god I wish they'd come back now more than ever. I really hope Meg is doing okay
was also tws last ever performance :(
CRYING
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing. Love it.

Wow...
Pure perfection by Moth Studio
So freaking cool
This is 💯!
Brilliant! Great storytelling!
♥
Awesome sauce
Everybody talking about unsolved but did y'all realize this man  learned to fly by sneaking into random homes and playing simulations. He wild 😂
Ahh! I finally just shared my coming out story!!
I remember when he was running around our islands. I’m sure that bastard stole my bike 😂
This was actually an interesting video, I liked it.\nThe video and its visual reenactment was well edited, in my opinion.\n\nSure, it's not Shane and Ryan, but this channel isn't all about them, they don't have their own channel, but maybe they'll be moved to their own channel like LadyLike.\n\nBut people gotta chill, man.\n\nThe people who did this video were cool to do this. I've never heard of this story before and it's pretty bizzare and out there.
Wtf ? Y'all better stopppp, this not Shane & Ryan bye.
There's no [WHEEZE]. I'm disappointed.
I live in mount vernon...
*why does every criminal story I hear happen in Washington state?!* I live in Washington state!
BuzzFeed is doing a lot of storytimes
as soon as i didn’t hear ryan’s voice i was pissed
This sounds like me. I go everywhere barefoot....I never leave prints tho (;
I thought it was big foot
I knew this ain't unsolved but still clicked it hoping that it might be 1% related to UNSOLVED.  The wheezes got me addicted.. Sorry not sorry. 😀 Can't wait for the new season starting today.  Shout out to Ryan and Shane,  I love you guys.
This should be an unsolved episode
this is almost like a modern story of icarus and the sun....with the sun being his obsession/source of obsession to fly.
The mini doc on tv about this guy is really interesting!
i did a project on this dude
plot twist: the narrator is colton harris moore
That is a really cool story. I wish him the best.
Ok people put together the clues ok listen \n\nFriday \nBuzzed unsolved \n\n\n\nWhat can u infer by this \n\n\n\n\n\nYou buzzed videos only come out on Fridays I know it’s sucks
when it’s been over a week since the last buzzfeed unsolved and you settle for this
I remember watching a document on him like 3 years ago
Was this a class project Buzzfeed?
wow he was born on the same day I was born!well not on the same year tho
Ryan and Shane should just make their own channel . I'm sure it would take off . We need unsolved everyday not lame filler waiting for it to come out .
when Unsolved is your most popular segment so you try to incorporate it into other videos
Guys get over it they missed an episode be happy with the free content you are getting
Why does this sound like Mr nightmare .. ?
He used to live in a half way house next to my apartments, that's where he actually ran way from, he shot our neighbors window out with a BB gun
BATHS ARE ILLEGAL OML I HAVE TO TELL THIS TO MY MOM
Can we leave the crime stories to Shane and Ryan? Please?
why does his voice sounds like Rami Malek
Come on guys, this isnt an unsolved mystery, nor does it say unsolved anywhere in the title. Obviously not going to be an episode of unsolved.
His mother lived next door to my aunt’s farm on a small island in Washington! Always signs saying do not enter, etc.
I hope he gets to fly again!!!
Was it just me or were there not enough details to make this story interesting??
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved...disappointed
Why are people butthurt about this not from Unsolved when the title clearly reads Crazy story of the Barefoot bandit? It's pretty clear that this not an Unsolved episode. Idiots.
I want a shirt with hey demons its me ya boi printed on it
Here for the unsolved comments
Stop comparing it to buzzfeed unsolved ! I actually really like this it was so positive ! You just have to watch it all the way though.
IT WAS MOSE BUT IN SOCKS
Just like I am obsessed with BuzzFeed unsolved. I come to YouTube . Refresh the application again and again everyday to watch a new video, even though I know it comes on Friday. 😂
hey that's where I live
I don't like the narrator .... His voice isn't interesting
I thought it was buzzfeed unsolved then I realized its not the day they post
Who else thought this was a surprise unsolved video?
My old co worker is currently dating this guy
Little town power electric tour wave.
I was born on March 22 too
I dont think people realize that this guy is like a modern day legend in the Bahamas XD
thank you for doing him!!! for unsolved crime,  can y'all  do Sherri Pepini?
He broke into our house and stole some food and a dirt bike which he left broken down in the woods.
Was this story supposed to have a point?
Honestly whoever is doing the voiceover, your voice is 😍😍😍😍
I clicked on this misreading it as 'bigfoot bandit' and now I'm disappointed
no crimes unless it's unsolved maybe they want to give you some crime vids bc the current unsolved season is supernatural and they're tired of y'all complaining 🙃🙃🙃
WE GET IT U THOUGHT IT WAS UNSOLVED GEEZ 😂
why is everyone thought this was unsolved? we all know that unsolved uploads every friday. smh
Unlike a lot of people in the comments, I like crime videos along with unsolved videos so thanks for the extra cool vid
0:14 THE PRIDE OF MOUNT VERNON
Only here for all the comments about Unsolved. Looking forward to Friday as well.
Bare foot\nB foot\nBig foot\nCase Solved\n(I know it isn't Buzzfeed Unsolved)
I don't get why everyone thought this was a buzzers unsolved video. They literally tell you the series, season, & episode #
i love all the crime videos. i just don’t get why people are complaining that this isn’t unsolved, this is a bonus for people interested in this stuff
This would be a fucking great movie
Buzzfeed SOLVED
I thought it said Bigfoot bandit
wtf I thought this was Buzzfeed Unsolved...
Ahhh clickbait
I don't know all the crimes he committed but I don't feel he deserved 7 years, he was underage and trying to survive.
pfffft, The Barefoot Bandit is nothing, have you ever ran into THE WET BANDITS??
How tF do you steal a plane
ummm,leave the crime stuff to the unsolved team
How do you fly a plane and not get caught
He was actually caught at a resort/restaurant/marina called Romora Bay in Harbour Island, Bahamas! My family used to go there all the time and the staff would wear shirts saying how they caught the Barefoot Bandit!
I like bare feet
Aha, you forgot something... *WHEEZE*
Elementary divorce reflection tennis diabetes owe battle.
Where’s oily sheen shane 😂😂
Fucking this isnt buzzfeed unsolved. More like buzzfeed disappointment
I read Bigfoot. I'm disappointed
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved 😭😭😭
I thought it was unsolved, wtf

*wheeze* \n\n\n\n\nWrong video
Hello, tonight I'd like to test some of our favorite and as well as some new sounds that can be triggering for you while testing my new mic set. I do need to work on some settings and get pop-filters still but overall I think these are pretty good :D What do you think? \n0-02:10 - intro and voice test\n02:19 - rolling crinkles sound\n05:55 - comb in the plastic ♥ \n09:47 - brushing of the mics\n13:27 - purple beads waterfall\n15:53 - crinkly sticky sounds\n17:47 - bumpy clicky sounds\n18:30 - shell beads high pitch clicky sounds ♥ \n19:41 - fast tapping on a smooth foam sheet ^_^ mmmm\n20:41 - light slime squishing and tapping \n21:36 - whisper test and goodbyes :) \nThank you, I hope you enjoyed it! ♥
Pink comb = eargasm. Lol please do more! Love the new mics too.
I wish this wasn't such a niche subculture, I'd LOVE to date an asmrist, but I can't find anyone who even knows what it is 😢
You are glowing and radiating beauty.... 😍😍😍
I'm sensitive but the pink comb didn't make me tingle or give me goosebumps.. it's probably because I don't have earbuds or headphones
watching asmr with my over sized razer gaming head phones its like OH MAH GAWD you guys should try it if you have a pair of krakens
Oh damn it. I've been trying to sleep for several hours and i'm about to wake up in 2 hours. I've keps scrolling through all these kind of videos in a while, and the only thing i get is feeling uncomfortable. Especially when people keep whispering, that makes me worry about how someone is about to murder me and wonder if I did lock the door. And seeing it doesn't really fix the problem. Back to the Liza videos, somehow they make me sleep..
You look similar to Kate Middleton (Princess in UK), only with lighter hair obviously.\nDon't mind me - just passing through :)
When you can't find your earphones. 😭😭😭😭
Ima be honest, this was the most relaxing slime ASMR
oh how I love the comb
2:36 that made me extremely uncomfortable...it sounded like termites in my ears
This video gave me tingles galore 🤤 Please use more slime!!
You should make a whole video with that pink comb💓great video by the way
I loved this..great job.. congrats on the marriage... Great to have you back, I missed your videos
This is my mega favorite video of all times!!!
Brain, Huh wonder what all this fuss about the pink comb i..... Oh lordy.
If you like the comb she has a cod it’s called intoxicating sounds and it has the comb in it
Who gets help sleeping while listening to this? Because I've never listened to it while going to sleep
Nice to read these comments abt ppl listening to this with some super high quality headphones and getting amazing tingles when im over here with my old cheap earpuds, one of them twisted like fifteen times so it would be just in the right position to even work LMAOO
I'm getting tingles down to my feet hahahaha holy shit! I love you Maria
Those new mics... OMG! I feel the sound deep in my ear 😻😻 I LOVE THE SOUNDS IT MAKES, specially when you whisper 💕 Thank you so much!
“What do you think? Good?” YES! VERY GOOD!
Honestly, i love seeing people get new things. That happiness in tandem with ASMR... ugh just awesome. New mic asmr is some of the best there is, cuz people are just so excited to mess around with them and see what new triggers and stuff they can come up with.
I absolutely love sounds from behind the ear, especially whispers! So excited for your new videos with these microphones!
this is so tingly!! thanks <3
You are so amazing! Thank you for making going to sleep so much easier and pleasant 💕 kisses from Brasil
Omg I love your sweater it’s so cute!!❤️❤️
I like ASMR but never really got tingles, this is just realxing for me but I had tingles for the first time with this video !
The goo test... oh my god. This combination of tapping and sticky-ish fingers... MORE PLEASE
Any small ASMRtists out there that wanna support each other??
I hope one day I find someone to marry who enjoys the small things as much as you do. I keep to myself alot, fortified in my castle, but every now and then I look out the window and see people like you, and I wish I knew them, not just observed them. But I often worry that they wont want to know me, so I just keep to myself. I have watched your videos for years, always smiling, always sharing. Its nice to see. Thanks for being passionate about something you enjoy and allowing us to be apart of it.
You look like Amy Adams.
I feel like Maria was like half high or something in this video like just up there in a happy place she seemed so hAppy?? idk how to explain lol
what microphones are you using?
does anyone know which other videos has the comb in plastic ??!!
She’s like a cutesy witch casting a tingly ASMR spell on us🖤
Well Gentle Whispering is becoming more and more a Godess isn't She? \nBest ASMR artist!
i feel like these mics would be good for a twin trigger word video
Hello!!\n\nYou can go to www.google.com for browsing!😋😋\n\nOr just relax😴😴
You are beautiful and amazing
my asmr trigger is lightening mcqueen saying “ka-chow” in a medium volume
am i the only one who loves that top with the choker ?

DID YOU SAID I LOVE MASS EFFECT?
I was wide awake.\nNow I'm yawning and can't stop.
A whole video of really close up whispering with these microphones would be so great, I don't get tingles anymore but I feel like a video like this could maybe bring them back💕
Those back whispers omg made me go tingling overload but it made me move for some reason idk why
When Maria whispered in both mics, my whole body did a thing and I don’t know what it was but it needs to happen again
I love how in the description she shows the time! So exciting!   l( '.  ') l
That is such a cute choker! ^_^
Hey that's pretty good
gentle whispering makes a video called intense sounds. Arent those like opposites?
You look like the princess in Kingsman
You look like Amy Adams.
You look very attractive ♡. Amazing video. Love from the Netherlands
The quality of your work is always amazing!  And you are so beautiful!  Thanks for being there on our sleepless nights for so long ❤❤❤
i want you to know that you look amazing here, Masha ☺️
I love your VOICE the most!♡
I am going thru thyroid cancer and some radiation and other health issues that keep me awake.  Thank you. Ur videos relax me.  I don't want anymore meds than what I already take.  You are wonderful!
God she's hot as hell in this.\n\n\nWell, when isn't she.

Passion debuted at #13 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzJNg0BqA7A&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=13
Is it a problem that I already knew the lyrics to this song by heart this morning when this song wasn't even 12 hours old yet?\n\nPA-PA-PA-PASSION!!!!!!
i started CRYING i have been a fan for so long!
I hope they blow up
Yes! Yes! Yes! God I love AWOLNATION so freaking much!
I love this band because they're so mysterious- I don't know how to describe it. Aaron is really unique, he doesn't truly stick to one genre. The songs switch from dark to upbeat, and the transitions are very well thought out, and planned. It can seem like it was all jumbled together sometimes, such as in Knights of Shame, but it matches and you can start to understand and hear the connections.
The only thing that sucked about this song was that it ended
The outro is so friggin AWOL.  I love it.  Can't wait to someday see this song performed live!
I like it. Sounds great.
This was a very pleasant surprise, quite refreshed I'm excited to see more :)
Hated it when I first heard it but the main verse stuck with me and now I love it!!! It's so awolnation!!!
Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind.  Wow what a great song........
I freaking love love LOVE AWOLNATION and everything they put out
I love the new song already <3
I can’t stop listening, what’s happening
So does this mean therre will be a tour???????
I hope this song gets on the fame and spot on the radio like sail did! I would love to see people appreciate awol more
I care more about AWOL than my own future and certain family members.
Sweet, another great album coming up? Well done. it's been an honor to have been a witness to the evolution of AWOLNATION. Hope to see you soon in the Los Angeles County. Keep up the good work.
This is so good!!!
I like the original but it’s really awesome at 1.5x speed!

350th comment
Our minds r blown 😍😘🙄💚💚🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
I loved that Irontom made an appearance. They need to your together again.
Does this Remind anyone else of the bohemian rhapsody video?
i have loved awolnation since before they were listened to on any public forum.  this video and song disturbs me.  :/
I love that this is kind of a mix of Megalithic Symphony and Run
THANK YOU THIS IS AHHHHHHH
I love Awol only band I'll ever preorder on vinyl and know its gonna be great
AWOLNation is back and better than ever!
IT FUCKING NEEDS TO BE IN THE NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND 3!!!
How I can give 1 millions likes for this song?)
When does the new album come out??\n\nEdit:This sounds more guitar driven, like Awol's predecessors: Home town hero and UTIOG.
I remember this dude back in 2006 as the lead singer of UTIOG. Safe to say, he's progressed amazingly
THIS HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR 4 DAYS STRAIGHT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO GOOD AARON
When the album red bull
Nice jam.  Keep us the good work guys.
Amazing song.  Can't wait for the new album and tour.
Just googled Awolnation wondering what they up to and discovered this....GREAT!!
Seriously I've been waiting so long for this and this is everything and more I want!!!! I can't wait to see them again live!!! (I need this album like now!!)
I appreciate them putting Irontom in this
Love it! I feel passionate about this song! :) Dying to see them live!
💖👍🏻😁
Nah man, not my jam
Pa pa pa passion !!!
S/O to the Irontom cameo in this video. ;)
I feel this album will take AWOL to the next level in regards to mainstream, and such. What a great song!
home town hero forever !!! arron Bruno for life!!!  yeaheweyeaheeeyeahhhhhh.  ROOOOCKKKKKKK
Cannot wait for new album :)
Awesome
So good. Thanks Red Bull for continuing to give Aaron an outlet to share his musical genius with the world. Can wait to see this live.
Fuzzy fun.
Here at 20k!! Absolutely love you guys! Can't wait for the new album to drop! 😭❤👏
I'm glad that awolnation still has the same kind of music and didn't change, unlike other bands (cough cough 30stm)
It sounds like gorillaz and nine inch nails had a baby, i love it
First I heard it, I was skeptical. Then listening to it a few more times, it grew on me, as it says, it blew my mind!!!!! It's fucking awesome!!!!
a great sound, spinnin' it..
Tbh kinda disappointed with this track. Loved their last album. Hope to see this new one top it.
Only here for grace
Amazing!! I can't get this song out of my head now!!!
This is an advertisement for Green Bull, no more Cannabis Hemp Energy Drink, Green Bull is what we need, hhahahahahha.
WOW! I love it!

Where's Kenny :O
I reviewed this here- https://aerolynxmusic.blogspot.com/2017/10/passion-awolnation-review.html so good!
Would love to hear an acoustic version.
they struck down my video about this song... but here is the catch i posted the lyric video before they did, should i argue the copyright strike?
Puh, puh, puh,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n puhtato
I saw a few ppl spraying the stick with fix + and mario badescu rose water to get it to be more wet cause the stick is dry
not a fan of anything but the highlighters and the gloss bomb. 😪
tap off the shit = me , btw luv this video qqqqq xx
That ending 😳😳😳 RIP headphone users
i lover his nails.!
OMG what is this😂😂😂
Your such a star!✨✨✨Get it...galaxy...😂 Q
Michael trying to highlight his ghost-ass white face with concealer is my new aesthetic and I love it
Trophy wife would have been so pretty in the inner corner of your eye. The look is so beautiful and the silver greenish color reminds me of money from the u.s. and trophy wife would be the perfect pop of gold.
His skin is way too light and the makeup is piled and piled and caked on.
You have to use a brush to blend the highlighter sticks and contour cause they are too stiff and dry if def will move ur foundation. Love the look!!
What shade highlight did he use
The highlighter sticks are very firm and you need to use your finger to pat it on and then blend out with a soft brush.
Now this is what I call a big fuck off wing wow
the name is not kilowatt jeezzz
When you called the highlighter kilowatt 😂😂😂😂 they’re all called that 💀
im not gonna lie your intro is better than james charles
DO a FauxFilter foundation review Michael!!!
I LOVE THIS MAKEUP LOOK & THESE ARE THE BEST WINGS EVER. INLOVE
Fuck me you were loud at 3:18am 😂 shit hun nearly woke my whole household up NOT A PROBLEM BINDI
That contour stick color looked like baby shit though 😂
Bindi I'm shooketh it wasn't better than dick mascara!
Your video of you reacting to old photos was so funny please do another !!!!
i fucking love this eye look, rock on
You’re so laid back in this video! None of your usual slag. What’s going on!? This is a problem. q.
Maybe try blending the contour creme with the fenty beauty blender?? I have heard it's really good!!! Love you Michael!!
I love his looks but how can he be the only one that has problems with stuf no one else has
Your reaction to the highlighter was literally me when I tried it 😂 \n\nalso what shade is the foundation? I didn’t catch it but I’m pale af so it’d probably suit me haha
Love the eyessss❤️❤️❤️and also what is the best lash glue that won't let your falses come off because I'm finding it difficult to find the best lash glue I tried everywhere😭
Have to shake the foundation well first!! Huge difference when you shake it before use
Michael you are so amazing to watch I absolutely love the looks you come up with. Keep slaying it sister your beautiful
Holy actual shit I'm actually in love with yours WHAT AHHH THIS LOOK IS AMAAAAAAAZIN qqq
did he get a nose job , looks fabulous
I was watching full monty before I watched this omg that's so weird 😂❤️❤️
oh my gosh I love you but I cannot stop laughing at how like this Foundation is! bahahahaha
Rewatching this so I don’t know if I commented already but this look is STUNNING q 😍😍
My house wifi is broken and i decided that you are the only one worth sacrificing my mobile internet 🙈❤️
The best face make up you've ever done. First I was like omg this foundation colour tho😂😂 but in the end it looked better than ever! Like literally soo beautiful 😍😍😍loved this combo (contour,Highlighting )
is it a drag makeup look ?
Love this look. No nails are missing this time and btw they are qqqqqqqq CYA!!!!!!!!!!!! XXXXX love you babes. Put this on your story omg ahah xxx
Does the maybelline fit me loose powder have flash back????
This is gorgeous!! For a video recommendation could u please do a natural warm toned everyday makeup look, just very natural and cute :3
Lol you look like literal  ghost but love this eye look and you. Hopefully I can come to your masterclass
Michael have you tried Sportsgirl's eyeshadow palettes? I bought 4 of them and they're amazing! I think you should do a review of them, especially the Pretty as a Peach one and Burgundy one
IN LOVE W THIS LOOK
fenty beauty do have a concealer but love you loads thooo xoxo
I really wonder how talented youtubers such as yourself don't have a million subscribers. Q 💜
Worth creature talk ywwbm chamber governor village supply gold card embrace.
okay so imma need some rock on merch on the website as soon as possible 💁🏼💁🏼💕
You look like Ursula from The Little Mermaid
Thank you for helping me lose weight. The moment I saw your face I realized you are mentally ill and I puked my lunch.\nStop it. Get some help.
If you don't want that unicorn shimmer stick I'll take it off your hands NOTAPROBLEM 🙋‍♀️🙌
Love you so much Michael QQQQ I hope I can meet you one day 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love you Micheal but please calm down with the lip injections, they look so uneven and balloon-like
I want the palette but I don't support mac because they test on animals! First world problems. Sooooooo pigmented
Have you lost your right earring ?
I love your nails
I don't understand how you can put makeup on every day for a living and still end up looking pale with ridiculous eyes or massively orange.?
Finally an honest review of Fenty beauty.
OMG your makeup is so nice you look amazing year girl xxx
Too much foundation, that’s why the contour stick ain’t blending
Complaining about the contour stick when you're sponge is still covered in the foundation. Of course it's gonna look like that
You over exaggerated just a little with the unicorn highlight stick 😂 it is honestly not that bad when applying it on customers it's best used when warming the actual product on the back of your hand and patting onto the skin instead of just wiping it onto the skin which will lift whatever is underneath it
Legit, if your ever having a bad day you, just need a little Michael fix!! You make me laugh dal 😘
Flash back Mary 😂
Biscuits
Great come back Ginger Jim! No I'm married with 2 babies thanks hun for the kind words!!! Your an idiot problem some lonely loser trolling people and cutting them down!!! And after this I'm not adding fuel to the fire it's clearly you can tell you have NO RESPECT FOR THE WAY PEOPLE ARE!!!!!

This is creepy
Dude did you do your research on Fenty beauty and how to use the products? All her powder highlighter are called Killawatt. The duos have the shade names on the bottom & on the box it comes in. This was a half ass  review.
This is fuckkkked
this is like those fucking weirdo rich people on the hunger games. fucking disgusting
this is why euthanasia should be legal
Freak
What, the fuck
Stopped watching at 0:01 in.  Absolutely horrid brows.
Cheap drag act

Any small YouTubers wanna support each other? 💕 I have a makeup and sfx channel!
I want to do this look with blonde hair and think I want to go for another color than this blue/green. What do you think could be a good color?
Your paint colors are giving me Beetlejuice vibes! Such a creative look🔥🔥
THIS LOOK IS EVERYTHING! OMG the talent is surreal!!
Awesome!! Where are the contacts from?!
EVERYTHING about this is just amazing! The fact that you showed where your inspiration came from, and also credited Madeyewlook for the technique is sosososo great, a lot of other people wouldn't do that!
YASSS Desi! Can you do your take on like a Dumbo/Elephant (cute or scary) inspired Halloween look? I haven't seen one like that, and I feel like it would be a challenge that you would kill!
My god you are the hottest demon ever!
You’re so talented! And u always do such unique Halloween makeup tutorials! 👏🏼🎃🖤
Loved it. On point for Halloween 👻

I was kinda sad they left there other house but dang this house is so nice,  AND IT'S A FREAKING 1 STORY!
I love the fact the pool is gated, u guys really put wicky first
dominic is getting sooooo big😭😻
Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!💕 #wilsonfamily
This house is fucking BEAUTIFUL 😩 and it's not even fully furnished yet
I like this house better then the other one they had 😄

This is the only Pixar Short that made me literally cry
Omg you have a son, congratulations
Why haven't I watched SuperCarlinBrothers in so long? I need to kick myself...
From what I've heard is that those two volcanos are based on Isreal something or other (Brother Iz is what they call him) and his wife or girlfriend... At least in their looks.
Not the socks!!!! Can't you guys like alternate or sell us more socks???
Lava is exactly like my life except I die alone and there is no happy ending. :,(
My favorite napkin story is Obi-wan writing his lightsaber plans on a napkin.
When I watched the lava song I started crying.😅
Whoa what about the fact that they were designed after the famous Hawaiian Rights Activist who sang the famous cover of Over the Rainbow and his wife??
I feel like the only person who did like 'Lava' . . .
Partly Cloudy is always my favourite Pixar short, followed closely by La Luna!
No more amazing socks? NOOOOOOOOO! *in Claptrap's voice*
I wanna watch this but official lava song is recommended.
Here’s my thought on Lou being so low: Lou is the newest animatic out there with the movie it came before not even on DVD so a lot of people haven’t seen it. Since people haven’t seen it putting it up against another animatic most have seen isn’t exactly fair\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think having far less dialogue is WAY better than the lyrics that run Lava
Listen, I think it's a really sweet little story. I do. But I can't be the only one that thought lava was a little... lame? \nAh I dunno, not my fave, anyway.
Can’t the turtles be kuru’s (from find Nemo’s) sons (or random kid-IDK)
Love super Carlin bros but every time I hear about the stupid kid I dislike the video
Honestly I'm not really a fan of lava. Idk why. Its just.... Not my favorite
Commenting before watching because I agree with this title
Geri's game still is and I think always will be my favourite Pixar Short it was probably the first 1 I ever saw and has ALWAYS been stuck in my mind
You should do a video on how Lava in connected to Moana. If it is at all contented
Aren't they also based on a real island?\nLike, the shot of them together at the end always struck me that it must be based on a real place, probably a volcano called The Lovers or something.\nNo? Just Me? Anyone?
Ukulele is basically Hawaiian for dancing fleas. Because the first people to play them had fingers that moved so fast that they looked like, well whatever dancing fleas look like.
Suck on my tater tots
i dont have a lava story sadly i wish i did tho
OH MY GOD I NEED TO SEE THE NEWBORN! MAKE A VLOG!
My favourite short is day and night
You talked about your son kicking and I automatically liked the video ❤
Meh. I don't think Lava is that great. Made it even worse when I saw Inside Out. The 2nd worst Disney Pixar movie! 😑
My favorite was the one about the guy in a desk job who was sad but ended up finding happiness and making friends and I just connect with it a lot.
@SuperCarlinBrothers. Ey! I think your video is cut off at the end... The vid needs some music! My songs might help youtube․com/XimerTracks
It could have been a turtle from Moana because Olaf will be in front of Coco so a mix of Disney and pixar in the shorts isnt unheard of.
Not going to lie I bawled when I watched this Short in theatres.
I've been waiting for someone who is worthy of my lava. I hope to be worthy of his lava too.....
Personally the first time I heard lava I teared up because I was lonely and wanted to meet someone and had given up because of past failures. But then I met someone later in life and now I can hardly remember being alone anymore.
Harry Potter question: We know that someone's Patronous and Anigmas animal are the same, because we were able to see McGonagall's Patronous. But if you change your Patronous, does you Anigmus change too?
piper yes it ain't any of your business.
This one is my favorite too.
If you want a place as a person... Hetalia
you should do a pixar movie tournament.
Are we not going to talk about the love of my life?! Israel “IZ” I-not-going-to-even-try-spelling-his-last-name?! He sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and is the main inspiration to the song aspect of the short! He’s a large Hawaiian who looks like Uku and his wife looks exactly like Lele.
Nooo.....Partly Cloudy is the best one!
NO. BOUNDIN WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST. BOUND. BOUND. BOUND AND REBOUND.
why did you stop the socks??????so sad
I lava him already hahahaha
lava sucks
My favorite was piper
Awwwwwww
I cry whenever I see lava
Anyone heard of Walk On’s?
10 pfffffffffffffttttttttttttttttttttt more like 7 ; )
R.I.P sock club
#ripsocks
#supercarlinbaby
#Bridecano enjoyed the vid!!!
Awww can’t wait to hear more about your unborn son
What about the one with the old man anx chest
OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU GUYS WERE HAVING A BABY CONGRATS MY FRIEND!! ❤❤❤
When u said u had a very sad announcement I thought u were quitting Super Carlin Brothers or like stopping for a little bit so u could spend time with ur wife and soon to be son
OMG UR GOING TO BE A DAD!!! I’m so happy for you J!
What place did day and night come?
I know Feast isn't technically a Pixar Short but you should talk about it!
It it brings me to tears. The love and wanting to be loved hit me personally. It was how I felt until I found myLele
The two volcanoes remind me of my grandparents. they got married when she was 18 and he was 21, and were together for over 60 years until she passed.
The little match girl 😭
LOL! I always have a real hoot watching your videos, though I havn't seen any in a bit, of course anything titled after LAVA would catch my attention! XD \nI Absolutely Love LAVA! I cried the first time I seen it in theaters, and then when I eventually showed it to my boyfriend (now husband), he cried too! XD so darn cewt dem volcanoes!\nAnyways we love singing it all the time, and then earlier this year when we found out we were pregnant, we knew our nursery theme INSTANTLY! Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\n\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!  (Plus Uku reminds me a lot of my husband, who is a giant cuddly ball of mush XD  )
My Lava story: 1 days after meeting a, we were hanging out doing homework together outside. On my iPod, Lava began playing and I sung the chorus to which I heard another voice join me and sing the verses.He was singing with me. When it finished we both were amazed somebody knew and loved the song and it is one of the things which bought us closer together. We have been dating over 1 year now and it is one of our songs we sing together and listen to when we miss each other <3
None of these reasons are why it was the favourite.The video was pretty yet sad and the song was the sameThe end.
Bro, lava is boss. Ukuleles. Where's my bois at?
Oh God, please don't get into top 10's. Too many of those. Stay original like you always are.
Bound almost came in dead last...?! How?! There is an emotionally supportive Jackalope!
Julie Chen: But First
So I watched lava again... Not into it but probably because I can't relate.
Yes Ukulele is pronounced oo-koo-le-le. And uku means lice/flea. Lele means to jump. So jumping flea. Which describes what the Hawaiian people saw when the Portuguese people brought the braguinha and played it for them. Fingers jumping around the fret board like fleas.
Boundin' is my favorite....
I'm sad that Paperman didn't make top 3, it's my personal favorite! I'm also surprised that Get a Horse! wasn't in top 3.
My friend randomly brought a ukulele to school and during lunch she played a beautiful rendition of Lava and everyone stopped to listen.
Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztaccíhuatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocatépetl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocatépetl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztaccíhuatl that his fiancé had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocatépetl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:
#LiveLifeButtFirst\nOne of my favorite hashtags btw 😂
Falling in Lava.
Lava makes me feel 😢.
Lava actually made me cry.
#livelifebuttsfirst!
Best Tim Burton film poll
My Favorite short is Boundin'. I do not have a Lava story to share (but I love that short). Tournament ideas: Best Pixar movie, best Harry Potter movie/book, thins in the star wars prequels that sucks the least, best Disney song, and coolest movie character of all time.
It's pronounced Ookalaylee but it's been Americanized into Yukalaylee. So yeah, you're right to think you're pronouncing it wrong. also pronouncing ukulele in the proper way sounds like a pretty cool battle cry.
I lava it
#ukulelescreamo
Pipper is probably my favroit 🐥🌊
No
Day and night
I think my sister is a valcano. \n\nSUPPER CARLEN BABBY BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-D
100% agreed
Lava 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE SOCKS
Slow da down!
Congrats on #41 on trending!
41 on trending
LAVA IS MY FAAAVVVEEERRRIIITTTE!!!!!!
Congratulations!
Pills debuted at #1 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFx0ROBf7o&index=1&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
I didn’t see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move 😂😂
Cara's voice is good :)
I give up, I just can't like her. Idk what you see David Byrne.
really? this is about as edgy as a marble. yawn, hard pass.
FREE REMIX of pills on soundcloud!!!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/puff-n-stuff/pills-paid-in-pain-remix
Can somebody explain what's going on in the vidéo ???
No bonus, buddy. No bonus
How have I not heard of this artist before? I love this!!!!
Cara Delevingne is singing the chorus. I cant
Cara !!!
Discovered this woman by watching the Kate Bush documentary. I hear Kate Bush all over this work!
I’m seeing St Vincent tomorrow night omg!!
New St Vincent's lyrics are too direct and edgy for me.
CARA DELEVINGNE 😇😇😇😇😇
Anybody else LOVING that Cara Delivigne feature!
Why does this sound like the pokemon red/blue song 'Guidepost' Love it!
3:08 - the lyrics are very reminiscent of Shine On You Crazy Diamond
I'm not excited by this last material
Thanks NPR for turing me on to this amazing Artist!
Sup, dudes. I am currently run a blog entitled Come and Share This Jam With Me where I share underrated and simply awesome songs that I love like Pills, and where I also discuss my delightful opinions about them. If you want to check it out follow this link: http://sharethisjam.blogspot.com/2017/10/pills-st-vincent.html or not, that's cool too
The childish melody on the intro and the chorus reminds me a lot of the Pokemon games on the gba
I'm not sure how many know how great Annie Clark really is, but I do, this girl is one of the greats...
I love this so much
time for me to see, my guitar to think
I really hated this song at first.
Brilliant. In every way.
i miss st. vincent, i miss annie clark. digital witness was certainly the harbinger for a departure, but i am afraid, in this departure, there is no lift-off. (my opinion)   2:42 is a saving return-to-form, the rest is so done, so medium. No boundaries pushed, which coming from annie clark, is what I interpret as pandering. que lastima...
Pills pills pills and a big stiff dick pills pills pills
it's crazy that it's been 10 years since I first heard Annie. Been devoted admirer ever since. \nI don't know if anyone else hears this but this is for me is evolution of the kind of stuff Pete Townshend was writing during the Who's Sell Out & Tommy era\nI immediately heard that kind of funny-but-serious approach in the pills to... refrain, and the left-field spiritual slow jam of the ending. That's the Who, right there. I'm loving every second of it. If only John Entwistle was alive to play bass on this shit. Love you Annie 💚🎶🎸🎶💚
Ugh, why so many dislikes.  St. Vincent is amazing and always will be.
Cum to think of it, she has a Jeff Beck vibe guitar tone going on. 😋
This is like two awesome songs merged into one.
The last part sounds like a 90's song we had in Romania, i kept listening to it didn't know why it sounded so familiar. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqILPaz1KU
does this remind anyone else of the underpants gnomes' song from south park?
pretty good timing for this song considering that the vegas shooter took anti anxiety pills that  drove him to psychosis
I don't even know if that's a bass anymore (what year is this?), but the responsible for it knows his stuff
The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\n\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.
The breakdown sounds like the Rain down... section from Paranoid Android to me... (a good thing)
the end half reminds me of Marry Me, and whatever happens before that gives me a seizure. I kinda like it. It feels like a solid blend between new and old styles. It reminds me a bit of The Apocalypse Song from Marry Me, and then Your Lips are Red, and then the hook is like a 1960's commercial jingle
Music of this woman is  absolutely Unique !!! 😍 I love it !!!! 😍
This is my happy pill!
i love the part Cara sings
I hate pills but I like this songs.
PILLS HERE
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
that rug is amazing.
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range
I hear Pokémon\nI hear Queen\nI hear Bowie\nI hear Pink Floyd\nI hear St. Vincent !!
Wow, love the song! Check out this group Head Noise below too, pretty quirky electro-pop also :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKts5guMOU
We Happy Few better use this song in their promo... It's literally perfect.
this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The outro has bowie vibes 🖤
Yes
Annie bravo <3
AOTY
I like this.
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
On my zillionth listen now!
I'm so freaking hyped!!!!
me come
I hear Pokémon Red/Blue!
https://youtu.be/eB-CTk8oimc listen my band please!
St. Vincent > Queen Bee
Annie is spitting rhymes. Awesome!
love it
Annie❤
Sounds fresh AF.
yawn
Sick
Much better than Los Ageless
Brilliant
ooooh
no disappoint me ever
Really talented pop composer though, like brilliant ear for melody and tasteful guitar, the music kicks ass. It's just like 'rage against the machine' or some other kind of immature preachy bad self-important lyricism, i can suffer through most of it.
SHe's a boring person desperately trying to be edgy and avant garde
Firm flop into pop on this album. Lalala fafafa pillspillspills. She used to rock.
Why aren't her new music on vevo?
I read somewhere that the Pills chorus has vocals by Cara Delevigne

I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. 😴😴😴😴😴😴

I know I'm not the only who was singing with the guys to spice girls😂😂🎤🎤
When the power tool was properly revealed I heard and ethereal grunting ala Tim Allen in Home Improvement. Like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLnFdYt4yZw
Your cakes always look so moist. Do you syrup them before cutting them or are they genuinely that moist!?
Ok the spice girls puns were everything 😂
Thumbs up if you watch this for the crew.
Please, Please, PLEASE!!!!! I need tomsee the guys singing the Spice girls... :)
I knew you were special! ;) Halloween baby here, I too love all things Halloween. Looking foward to all of your creations.
So beautiful! I love you guys!! Too funny
Please collab with Yolanda of how to cake it
The spider won't bite us but we'll bite it
Joshua, may I ask why you trim the cake before crumb coating? curious and wanting to learn
I'd love you to do an Atlantis themed cake...!
Whats up with his nose in this video? It looks like serious contouring...
I like your cake
Você é show de bola!!!!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🍰🍰
This is so gorgeous! I love it!
I love your crew! This video had my daughter and I cracking up. When will we meet the crew?!?
This has been my favorite video yet- one day I'd love to see the faces behind Spice Girls 2.0 😂👍🏼
JJR ~ I condition the gum paste with shortening as well as rub the outside of the gum paste with shortening before inserting into my extruder.  It works.  Thanks for the laughs!!!  :D
There are definitely five Spice Girls, guys. \n\nSporty, Baby, Ginger, Scary, and Posh.
Sorry jjr, I also love spice girls soooo. I actually like them singing. Bwuahahaha
Can I please marry Brandon?😂 He seems so funny!
the spider looks like a crab
Hi Joshua i liked  your cake design and I’m wondering what type of gold paint do you used??please provide the name Thxs
Amazing how do u do it
Its Saturday and I'm STILL singing Spice Girls songs!\nThanks guys!
I really appreciated watching the struggle of innovation. It made me feel like it is totally worth every time I try something new. Thanks!!
The middle of the video is a hot mess haha
The guys should sing in every episode.
but the spice girls are amazing especially with spice cake
What do you have against Spice girls Joshua ? lol
This thumb up was for the Spice Girls enthusiasts behind the camera. You guys rocked.
I was the grudge for my freshman year of college.... totally won the costume contest! It was badass
I HATE SPIDERS.\nNo wonder this didn't appear in my sub list.
I’m so scared of spiders that it gives me chills even seeing you make it, especially the pointy legs of them but I couldn’t help but watch till the end and it’s beautiful
You love the Spice Girls and you know it! Friendship never eeenndss!
This was extremely good I loved it plz make more videos
To make you feel better there are 5 Spice girls, so Brandon is a little less creepy now. Well on that end of the spectrum 😂
JJR, the spice Girls are nothing to be ashamed of! We all love them, even you! Don't fight the spice.
Where do you get all of your shirts??? I love them!!!
Found your channel from iJustine! Love it.
He hates the Spice Girls,  tries to use a drill to make gum paste strings for decoration, and knows what channel locks are. Yep, definitely a Man . . . About Cake.\n\nAs for my costume, I'll be dressing up as a skeleton for work, but my husband wants us to dress up as peanuts so we can be nuts together.
Does whatever a spider cake does
I love this cake
Next Video please collab with How to Cake It
My new favorite sound is the cutting bubble tea straws. Btw just found your YouTube channel from the trending videos.
Aw, JJR, the crew's singing is great though!!! Love the cake (even though I'm arachnaphobic) and the crew!
I was Baby Spice when I was 8, my best friend was sporty spice and my neighbor made us sing for our candy.
Can you do a vampire team please. Beacuse I am a big fan of Twilight movie.🖒👍👍
I loved the guys singing and making JR turn red in the face. LOL 🤣💘
Long time ago I made and wore an autumn-themed costume  (that was inspired by Marjorie the Trash Heap on the puppet show FRAGGLE ROCK)  to work which won 2nd place in the costume contest. It was a separate hood over a long sleeved maxi length dress out of soft, drape coral-orange knit fabric; covered over with preserved florist autumn leaves and stems that I had meticulously appliquéd by hand. The accessory was a fan rake and to remove ANY doubt as to what I was supposed to be, my name tag read:  Pile-a Leaves!\nYou could make an Pile of Leaves autumnal cake like that too.  Bet it would be gloriously golden and gorgeous!
Really bitch! I was about to go to sleep and then I seen this video in my recommendation 💀💀😢😢
The Spice Girl puns! Lol Had me dying!
For the record, there were FIVE Spice Girls. Not four ;)
I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol 🤣🤣😂
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
You guys are funny! (: JJR I always enjoy watching your vids!
These are two videos I believe everyone should watch and share.\n\n1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI&t=224s\n\n2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCLoIorYguU
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL 😂
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
Sorry, but I gotta love the singing and the Spice Girls references.  Totally liked for the Spice Girls stuff!!
I like the added Spice Girls 😅
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
This is one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen! It's so elegant!!! I loved every detail... AMAZING JOB!
so is he a top or bottom
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing
New subscriber here if u wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends making it last forever frrrrieeeendships never ennnnnnnd😂😂😂😂😁😁😁
Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile 🤗
Can make a Australia themed cake pls
I will sing a spice girls song every time I hear pumpkin spice lol
hands down my favorite episode the singing and back seat caking make this too legit to quit. #backseatcaking
https://youtu.be/c1_4SNLT2sk  Não sei se isso te interessa  Você se lembra deste video ?😊

LOLOLOL, those references. LOL dead. FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDSSSSSs
Love it lol
Make a jack skelington cake!
stop singing LOL
Wow that's amazing
Personally, I'm quite partial to the B line.
My favourite train line is the Grove Park to Bromley North train line for three reasons:\n1. Its only three stations long (Grove Park, Sundridge Park and Bromley North) and is therefore very fast\n2. It takes me straight into town\n3. There's never ticket inspectors so its always a free train journey which one can never refuse! Who doesn't love trains?!
The West Coast Mainline
I have a new favourite customer at work. He came in about a quarter to closing time, and said 'I NEED YOUR CHEAPEST BIKE.' Lovely, goodnatured man, had been working since 2am and needed the bike asap so his son could get to work the next day. He was clearly stressed but didn't take it out on me or my colleague at all.
My favourite book right now is either Turtles All The Way Down or Songs About Us. Both are brilliant!!
Recently, one of my favourite songs has been What about by Janet Jackson, all thanks to you
I always feel guilty if I don't buy one of the products a sales lady recommends me, but I always do the I'll think about it deal and run away.
Where are you? Miss your videos. :-(
My favourite trainline is waikanae to wellington but that's in nz so you'll have no idea 😊 my favourite author is robin hobb 100000/10 recommend if you're into fantasy
my favourite train line would be the one that goes from London to Brighton that's such a nice one the worst is great western railway fuck them
AHHH omg my new best one is the film Pan's Labyrinth. Watched it for the first time today with school for film studies A level. I have never seen a film so aesthetically wonderful whilst also so technically brilliant and narratively stunning. I personally connected with it a great deal so that helped a lot-I was in tears most of the time. I adore the fantasy aspect and the historical setting but also love the darkness of it and how it is not just a (disturbing) fairytale but also the relation of that with the context of the Spanish rebels fighting the facist group after the civil war. That description was a mess. But I just really had a lot of feelings about the film.
Came back from Amsterdam today and although not a train line, it was the bus line that our driver lovingly called the “cocaine express”. One hell of a ride.
I like London Midland, free WiFi unlike Virgin.
I do love the DLR
I think the bakerloo line is underrated
The jubilee line is my fave tube line and Japan is my favourite country ever now having visited
Try the Gentleman's Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Basically Oceans Eleven meets Assassin's Creed. Warning the series is still ongoing, only 3 books out. But its so amazing. The way he writes is basically like he's painting movie scenes and dialogue is hilarious :D
Metropolitan because if you get the right train you skip some bits and get where you want to go much quicker! ;P
my favourite train line is the go transit lakeshore west line which means nothing to people that do not live in southern ontario but it is a good train trip 10/10. my favourite books include but are not limited to the night circus by erin morgenstern, she is not invisible by marcus sedgwick, and the rest of us just live here by patrick ness
I read All That She Can See by good ol carrie hope fletcher, absolutely loved it! Rewatched Black Mirror ultimate favourite and favourite film i've watched recently is probably Moana (i watched it again i love it so much). A favourite train line in wales cannot exist because Arriva are shockingly bad you wouldnt believe. I've been on the london underground once and literally can't remember any names so who knows
The Lobster is very much the same, perhaps darker, but I haven't seen the new film yet. Thanks for the vid, Dan! Oh also, the line from Providence to S. Station, Boston 😊
I recommend La Vita É Bella, if you haven't seen it, it is one of the most beautiful films in the whole entire world with comedy cleverly spread throughout... another good film is Hunt For The Wilder People, it's hilarious and you will be quoting it forever 😸
on the train to edinburgh, near the scottish border the train goes right next to the see and it always just fills me with a bit of warmth inside
Favs\nGreat British Bake Off\nEducating Greater Manchester \nRed Queen series
I have too many favorite books, but only one favorite train line. Portland Oregon Tri-Met Max Red Line.
I could honestly watch your videos all day, your voice literally soothes me and your dry sense of humour really brightens me up, thankyou so much for being such a natural creator
Ooh I like participating\n\nI haven't seen it yet but I can tell Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is soon to be a favorite. And I've been listening to The Regrettes for the past couple weeks and they're incredible and I'd highly recommend if you want some good riot grrl punk fun
I have the same mask from The Body Shop and its wonderful
Okay so most importantly, I live in Perth and my favourite train line is the Fremantle Line, also known as the Blue Line so... that's fun.\n\nFavourite movie is 'Breakfast at Tiffanies' and if you have seen the film I recommend the book, get ready for a wild ride. I personally like the movie more, you'll see why. \n\nFavourite book is trickier because it depends on mood. If you want a good YA novel I recommend 'Six of Crows' and it's sequel 'Crooked Kingdom' by Leigh Bardugo. It's a heist novel but also not a heist novel... yeah. If you want just... fantastic, 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman (I've only read the extended edition) it's brilliant. \n\nI liked this video a lot. :)
One that had me in tears was Flight by Sherman Alexie, who's a quality author btw
i’ve been jamming nonstop to the new ballparkmusic song ’exactly how you are’ it’s so nice and it makes me feel nice
Honestly, all I've really read this year are books related to Star Wars. Would highly recommend Lost Stars by Claudia Gray.
Has to be the Transpenine express
My favourite train line is the dlr because it has the least amount of sweat in the air, and also has near to no security, so when I'm broke I can just...jump my way in... >.<
the one that goes from Lichfield to London cuz its cheap as fuck buts its like the ryanair of trains and normally you have to sit on the floor or by the shitters so thats fun but it goes to euston which is better than all the other pretentious and expensive train stations in the middle of bumfuck in London -cough- st pancras
My favorite book at the moment is ‘walking the underground overground’ which u recommend ages ago. I really enjoyed reading it and learning so much. The book doesn’t just tell you facts about the tube lines and its stations but also gives you a new perspective on how to view London and it’s hidden treasures. Living in Australia I have had the lucky opportunity to visit London and I wish I had read this book before I visited. Because instead of taking the underground to the places I wanted to visit I wish I walked around the city more and see these diamonds in the ruff. I loved London and I hope to go back one day and visit some of the places mentioned in the book. I also highly recommend the book to anyone!!!
I'm so jealous of the uk/America.... everybody is complaining about summer ending and winter starting. I'm sad because I can't remember a single day that it rained this winter. I want winter back I'm moving to the UK for 6 months
Blade Runner 2049, First sequel i've ever seen as good if not better than the First, fallout series, i love video games i love sci fi and post apocalipse YouTube, it's been a lovely few months, october i love cold months i can't stand heat. Andddd movies in general as always
My best ones this month have been The Book Thief and Rick and Morty...quite opposite tones. Says a lot about my brain atm.
my favourite train line by far is the line from bristol temple meads to reading. sometimes late but a good solid relaxing journey, often not too busy despite being over an hour, some pretty countryside to look at. 8/10\n\n\n\n\nalso wth are you doing with a hillary book dan. ew
My favourite train line is the central line, super continent to get from my house into central London. Highly recommended 8/8, 6 stars, 100% reliable
Oh my god! I didn't understand that you said 'colder months' i thought you were talking about some Game of Thrones thing called coldemonts 😂😂😂
I've seen Blade Runner 2049 at the movies the other day and it was mind blowing. I am so affected by it... IT'S SO GOOD
My favourite train line is the steam train that runs between the coastal village of Swanage and the even smaller, cobblier village of Corfe (which has an awesome castle next to it). It's all very picturesque and lovely there. Thank you for asking.
You asked for it, so here goes - my favorite train line is the regional train from Leipzig to Chemnitz (both in Germany).
Did you say favourite train line? Because in all seriousness, there's a line known as the Heart of Wales line which goes between Cardiff and Holyhead, but the only bit I've been on is (ironically) the English bit from Hereford to Shrewsbury, and it's got some darn lovely views.
I'm really enjoying bus 12 at the moment, it goes from Utrecht central station to the university and it's so so so crowded. Almost everyone hates it but I think it's so amazing, you see the most interesting people, you hear the most crazy stories and I sometimes make friends for like ten minutes and then never see them again
I don’t have a favourite trainline... now I want one
My current favorite thing to watch (besides you and josh giving me almost daily content) is drunk disney by practical folks! It's really fun and light hearted and I'm just really enjoying the easiness of it
Favourite thing at the moment is King Arthur. That movie was incredible; I was thinking about it for days after seeing at the cinemas and once I'm done planning the blocking for the play I'm directing (send help, please) I'm going to reward myself by getting it on dvd.\nFavourite train line is the airport line (usually not going to the airport when I use it though - usually going to concerts at the Opera House!). Much nicer than the train line that's actually the closest to my house.
I LOVE that mask! Wish I could use the others but I'm allergic :( instead I use Lush masks instead
If you're a hygge fan 100% come to Denmark - I thought the whole hygge craze in the UK was just capitalism capitalising on some random concept that doesn't really exist but Danish people LOVE hygge and are always trying to make situations more hygge. For example, in the University of Copenhagen Library there are free blankets you can borrow to wrap yourself in while you do your work! It's the best, Denmark is a cool place.
House Of Cards mate. That is the current favourite. What a show. Also What Happened was great, but made me extremely angry and upset all over again. I JUST WANTED HER TO WIN OKAY (still not over it)...
If you haven't seen/read it I would recommend The Handmaids Tale in both book and TV form
My favourite train line is the Joondalup line but that would mean nothing to you haha A really good book I read recently is The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead.
bakerloo line forever. also i'm reading The Power by Naomi Alderman and thoroughly enjoying it
Tube line? The Victoria or the overground \n\nIf you’re not talking about London, I like the sky train in Vancouver... but I’m a bit biased. ;)
My favourite train line is the Kapiti line from Wellington Station to Waikanae
my favorite train line is either the Corona or Hargita Lines that go between Budapest and Brasov, passing through the best pockets of Transylvania and Székelyföld.
Dan, I'm sure that soup is delicious and I myself and psyched for soup season.. but frankly, and I'm sorry, it looks like you're eating a bowl of shit
can you please talk about what happened  when youve finished it?
right now it’s my summer doona as i’m in australia. haven’t been out of bed for a few months because depression but i love this doona.
my alltime favourite book is I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson and its INCREDIBLE. ive read it three times and marked my copy to hell and back. cannot recommend it enough
Eyy! I made potato and cheese soup today because it got cold enough :D I'm quite the opposite, I enjoy the cooler weather much more than the warmer months. I like the warmth, but only for a short time. I don't like being hot and sweaty :/ I like cozying up with a blanket, a book, a cup of tea or coffee, and a pet (preferably a cat). I can't wait for snow and more baking and cooking!
are you sure winter is coming?  i'm not.  you prefer the summer months?  april thru october possibly thru november possibly thru december possibly forever.  damn what ISN'T a summer month at this point?  come here, you'll have a blast at least until ya get heatstroke in the deep south united states.  this place will cook you like roast chicken.
Can't believe you didn't ask about favorite soup! After that whole intro! I'll tell you anyway. I made a delightful cauliflower green curry soup last night that was very much in the spirit of hygge.
I'm a pretty big fan of the Gold Coast line
I'm rereading The Martian cos it's so heckin good. also rewatching stranger things. I should probably try to consume new entertainment but. The Martian. so heckin good.
Does anyone else constantly want to run their fingers thru Daniel’s hair?
My favourite book and movie haven't changed since I was 10 (which is Harry Potter and Nightmare Before Christmas respectively). Don't know what that says about me as a person considering at age 24 my favourite things are still the same as they were when I was 10 :/
I don't put it on my beardy bit oh Daniel, you wonderful human!
When you're taking a break from studying Brecht and Mother Courage, to watch a Daniel J vid where he references BRECHT
Daniels videos always make me feel so calm and welcome and warm...omg his videos are the soup of youtube vids!
I like steam engines not because of the pollution but because of the industrial revolution occurring and inspiring creativity
if you haven't already: HIdden Figures.
love the northern line.
Well the Milton line, I guess. not that Go ever gives it good service.
i like london midland bc their trains are clean and well spaced out and USUALLY not too busy. also enjoying my bedding i got for uni from matalan (its sO soft) and this charcoal and bamboo face wash by t-zone (really cheap and good for oily skin, if you're a student buy it in superdrug bc they do student discount if you have unidays)
I like the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini. Extra info about it, it was originally intended to be a trilogy, but the world got so complex, along with  the characters, that it broke that oppressive system and became a four-parter. Mandatory reading for all humans who like fun and don't know everything. I love train line 2, in my city. It's the older one, and has far more interesting people on it.
favourite train line is edinburgh to london kings cross, because whenever im coming to london its for something exciting - an interview, a visa appointment, a reunion with friends - london itself im not that fussed about but that train journey means im going to something not somewhere.
Over summer, I went inter railing with friends. We were travelling between Vienna and Venice overnight, on a thirteen hour journey. There were three of us, along with two strangers, packed into a small cabin with three seats lining each wall. About half an hour into the journey, we discovered that each of the seats could be made to fully recline- in essence, the bum bit of the seat slid forward to allow the back bit of the seat to slide down and become horizontal. We did this with each of the seats, essentially converting the cabin into a great big mattress, the five of us lying parallel to one another trying to get some sleep.\n\nIt didn't work. I was really uncomfortable, and around 1 in the morning decided that enough was enough. I left the cabin and went and sat in the connecting bit between two carriages for a couple of hours, listening to music. Eventually, I felt just exhausted enough to maybe catch some shut eye. I snuck back to the cabin/bed, climbed over my friends, and tried to lie still, waiting for sleep to come.\n\nI managed maybe an hour of sleep, maybe a bit more. I zoned in and out of consciousness, noticing street lights dashing by in valleys far below us, and deducing that there must be so much Austrian countryside we were missing out on in the night. Sleep came and went for another couple of hours, until I came too and noticed that we were in daylight. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked out of the window. My gasp was loud enough to waken the cabin.\n\nWe were in the middle of a mountain range as the sun rose, and the view was unlike anything I've ever seen. It was the most spectacular assortment of mountains and trees and snow and sun. It was the type of moment you imagine in your head, an unachievable fantasy that could never actually pan out. Like a moment in a John Green novel. An instant of pure beauty. And it was real, it was tangible. I could pull the emergency stop cord and run out and be in that view (I didn't). It was one of the most magical moments I can ever remember experiencing.\n\nThat's my favourite train line.
As I've just started my gap year of doing odd jobs and figuring out what I wanna do with life (lol) I've started compiling lists of books and films I should read and see. Top of my books list are gone girl, the handmaid's tale and the bluest eye, although I recently bought Rest In Power (a book written by Trayvon Martin's parents about his life and death) which I'm quite eager to read. I finally watched Arrival the other day an loved it and am meaning to watch Hacksaw Ridge and all Star Wars because I haven't actually watched any of them all the way through (Ik I'm sorry). Also got a tv show list and next up is Westworld...This is a real long comment I hope someone actually finds it interesting lol
Me: what are caldamons, is that something from Game of Thrones that I forgot about? ...  Oh, wait. caldamons, warmer months, colder months, warmer months....
My favorite ones...AVATAR the last airbender because I've been binging it again and it's glorious and I've made peach cobbler, pecan cookies, and apple muffins this week. My kitchen is well stocked and I got promoted yesterday. There's a crap ton of wildfires that's making the air awful and scary (I live in Northern CA right where the fires are happening) but a lovely breeze came this afternoon and swept it all away. LIFE IS GOOD. Food is amazing. Dan Howell uploaded a fantastic video today. What more could a girl want
DLR
Favourite train line...Southern.
~Things I Live For~
Awww Daniel! Where you be?

My favourite movie is def Stardust.
Eastmidlandstrains reppin 👌
Bakerloo, mate, every time
Favourite movie - Pride (2014) soooo good
the central line...for literally no particular reason
Isn't hillary extremely corrupt? She constantly changes her stances e.g. gay marriage just to win votes, she's known to be in the pockets of big powerful companies?
The Settle to Carlisle railway, which crosses the amazing Ribblehead viaduct in Yorkshire, is by far my favourite train line. I don't understand how you can even compare lines like this with London Underground lines and similar metro systems - they don't fit in the same category in my mind.
I think this is a good camera angle for me
Josh, I'm honestly wondering how, at this point, you don't burst into laughter at your own jokes. Like, that in itself is impressive.
this was crap
“oh yeah he’s a crisp man”
is this whole series just an elaborate excuse for Josh to introduce us to amazing music? cause boi, i'm in
hey josh this is so great i love you youre doing amazing sweetie
jack screams when he laughs it's a lot
It’s manager *snap* josh, *snap* it’s manager *snap* josh *snip snap* plus my two favorite YouTube skit makers Jack and Deano. Love you guys❤️
I actually love these videos😂
I've never seen such a fair game show?? How are you such an impartial judge?? Honestly inspiring😍😍😥
Who am I to argue with... logic
The better question here is how Daniel J didn't burst out laughing before he appeared.
I'm going to be so upset when VIDEO is over
jack’s laugh > everything else
God love ya, Manager Josh
amazing. best trio
Iconic.
Why does jack want to kill mice so bad jeez what did Mickey ever do to u
I want to win a Daniel j Layton
Love your humor. This is old school YouTube. People just having a laugh for laughter's sake.

Jack I think you broke my speakers.
Worlds best birthday gift.

I'm gonna miss this quality content when October is done

Reppin’ the 808! Love that hat

He always looks so happy while singing! He's just always trying to have a good time with his music 😌 I love how he shares the spotlight with his background singers and they act like a whole unit. I could go on, but Bruno is an amazing performer!
You're just the best Bruno Mars. Thumbs up bruh.

#YIAYpoint:\n\nPHILIP PULLMAN NOVELIST\nHere we are, alive and conscious, in a universe that seems to be made of material things like atoms and quarks and Higgs bosons and so on, which are undoubtedly there but possess enigmatic, ghostlike properties that are hard to grasp, such as entanglement and the wave/particle duality. What are we to make of it all?\nI start with consciousness. I am certainly conscious, and I’m equally certainly made of matter; so I conclude that matter is capable of consciousness, and there’s no need to make up a thing called a soul to do the consciousness while the dull, inert, clod-like body does the carrying around. I’m certain that animals are conscious, and I see no reason to deny a form of consciousness to plants too. Don’t they sense where the sun is, and turn towards it?\nHumans and animals and plants are alive, though. Perhaps consciousness depends on being alive, and not just on existing. Surely stone, air and water aren’t conscious?\nI’m not so sure. It’s not hard to imagine that consciousness might be a normal property of matter, like mass. Thanks to the Higgs boson and its associated field, we now know how mass exists. Maybe there’s another field and another particle, as yet unsuspected, which deal with consciousness. Maybe what we call dark matter and dark energy are aspects of that very field. Or maybe not. But when by chance complex structures like the human brain evolve, consciousness is able to think about itself, and reason, and imagine, and empathise.\nThat sort of self-reflexive consciousness is a good thing. The more of it there is, the better we’re able to understand and create and be kind. So here I come to what the point is: the point is to bring about more consciousness. By teaching, or doing mathematics or science or philosophy, or writing novels and poems, or making music, or painting pictures, or studying history, or healing the sick, or bringing up our children to be generous and kind, we leave the universe a little more conscious than we found it. And that’s the point.\nMARY MIDGLEY PHILOSOPHER\nRichard Dawkins has told us that the cosmos is pointless. Our universe has, he explains, “precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good”, nothing but “pitiless indifference”. This suggests that human life—which is, after all, part of the universe—must be pointless too. Dawkins, however, plainly doesn’t think so, or he wouldn’t find it worthwhile to work so vigorously at spreading his philosophical views. And in our biosphere this perseverance is not exceptional. A vast variety of organisms, from snails to eagles, work fiercely and persistently at their own business. Acorns buried under paving-stones don’t just settle down there in comfort. They do their damnedest to wriggle out and grow up into proper oak trees. Human beings, too, often work incredibly hard, tilling the soil, catching fish, exploring deserts or busily writing books to cure other people’s errors.\nSometimes, however, the road before them runs out into the sand and they must look around for alternative possibilities. What they want then is a wider context, a larger hope to which their work can contribute. Thus, when Tennyson’s Northern Farmer looks back over his life on his deathbed, he is happy because he can claim that he “stubb’d Thornaby Waäste”—that is, he has cleared it, making it fit for crops and cows—fit for the decent agriculture that he believes in. His son, however, very differently, forbids his own son (quite in today’s style) to marry a girl with no money:\n“Wot’s a beauty? The flower as blaws –\nBut proputty, proputty sticks, an’ proputty, proputty graws …”\nWe might not now want to endorse either of these world views. But we surely follow the same method of looking outward towards a larger perspective, even if that means looking as far as the limits of the universe. What we aim at is surely the welfare, success and prosperity of whatever cause, or whatever people, we most love, honour and wish to be part of. That aim is what gives point and meaning to our lives—which is why we need to choose it so carefully.\nJOHN BURNSIDE POET\nAs any teenager can tell you, it’s a short step from asking the question: “What does it all mean?” to arriving at the inevitable answer: “Nothing.” Meaning is constructed by each person after her own fashion, his own nature; there is no universal formula or divine plan—no “all”—that can make individual lives meaningful. At first, such a realisation can lead to dismay: befuddled by the schemes and promises of our elders and betters we had trotted dutifully to school and kirk and community discos full of the blithe enthusiasm youth is cursed with, in the sure expectation that a worthwhile life would just fall into place, with a modicum of effort, so long as we did the right things. Maturity, love and marriage, job satisfaction, happiness—they were all out there, waiting to be achieved. So we thought, until this perennial teenager’s question cropped up, and we began to doubt.\nDoubt is a good thing, most of the time. As is the shedding of illusions, however painful the process. For after dismay, after the insomniac nights and the hollow feeling in the pit of the mind, what follows (if our supposed betters can be persuaded to refrain from meddling) is the gradual understanding that, since meaning is neither fixed nor universal, it is determined, to a significant extent, by the power of the individual imagination. True, there is a world out there that would compel us to conform, to consume, to render unto Caesar. But we are, nevertheless, free to resist, free to imagine, free to furnish our lives, and the terrain we inhabit, with meanings that derive from our own natures, and from the nature of our home terrain.\nHenry Miller remarked that “life has to be given a meaning because of the obvious fact that it has no meaning.” But he also said that “the aim of life is to live, and to live means to be aware, joyously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.” In a conformist society, the attainment of that joyous, drunken, serene awareness is both an act of resistance and a personal achievement, for it says to hell with Caesar and his tawdry coin, and leaves each of us to invest life with all the intangible and unaccountable forms of wealth that the imperial minions in their counting house can scarcely begin to imagine.\nELIZABETH KOLBERT REPORTER\nThe “point”, Darwin taught us, is to pass on our genes. This is as true for humans as for any other organism—chimpanzees, for example, or planaria. The formula worked for life for the 3.5 billion years before Homo sapiens came along, and it isn’t likely to change now, just because people tend to find it unsatisfying.\nMost of us would, of course, prefer to believe our lives have a higher purpose than those of E. coli. The very capacity to aspire—to truth and beauty, fame and fortune, intimacy and immortality—is one of the characteristics that sets modern humans apart from other species. But the mistake is to project the structures of our minds onto the nature of existence, to demand that the world conform to the way we think about it. “Endless forms most beautiful” evolved without us, and will continue to do so after we’re gone.\nPerhaps the wisest thing we could try to do is to make peace with pointlessness. This is not so much a prescription for personal happiness as a petition on behalf of creation. Right now, expressions of human purposefulness are transforming the planet—reshuffling the biosphere, altering the atmosphere, and changing the chemistry of the oceans. We’ve ushered in a new geological age, the Anthropocene, which is likely to be marked by the highest extinction rates since the asteroid impact that did in the dinosaurs.\nHow might we pursue a less purposeful existence? We could begin by trying to do less. This might seem like a negative goal, but it would actually be hugely consequential. As it stands right now, humanity’s most lasting accomplishment will be our pruning (or hatcheting) of the tree of life: a sad legacy, and one we should do everything in our power to avoid. The challenge to us as a species is to let other species pass on their genes—to allow them, too, to have a point.\nYIYUN LI NOVELIST\nA while ago, I worked as a researcher in a hospital laboratory, studying asthma with mice as the animal model. My job was to inject ragweed into the mice over a period of time and measure the effectiveness of a new drug. There was a glass chamber, I remember, where I put the mice to induce asthma, and then analysed their breathing patterns. That and other methods gave me the data of their illness, though imperceptible to me was their physical sensation: suffering, which is an individual feeling, cannot be measured.\nAsthma comes from a Greek word, meaning panting. But in ancient Rome, the doctors nicknamed it “rehearsing death”. I ran into this detail while reading Seneca’s letters to his disciple Lucilius. Seneca, like Dickens, Proust, Dylan Thomas, E.B. White, Elizabeth Bishop—the list could go on—was afflicted with asthma, an ancient disease that hasn’t, unlike many others, gone away. There was no one trying to cure the illness by dissecting mice in Seneca’s time.\nEveryone, sooner or later, draws their last breath. What’s the point of living, one could ask, if we all have to come to a dead end? What’s the point, if life never tires of offering situations like asthma? Far from fatal, these nevertheless cause inconvenience, suffering, even despair—in a letter Stefan Zweig wrote before his and Lotte Zweig’s suicides, he mentioned her incurable asthma as one of the reasons for their decision.
#YIAYpoint    There’s supposed to be a point?
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
I can relate to this so much, thank you for this video and sharing your story <3 (and, like, all the other stories. I really love your channel) I've been vegan for about 1,5 years now and it has really expanded the variety of foods I eat. I used to hate the texture of beans but now we're starting to be friends :----D\n\nI don't consider myself sporty and it's been difficult to find a form of exercise that I'd enjoy but last autumn I did and it's roller derby! I love that it's a mix of speed and strategy and contact, and learning to roller skate has been so much fun! The sport has such a strong, accepting and welcoming community and to me it has really helped me to embrace to body I live in and to see the strength and capability to learn that I have. So I can highly recommend roller derby if you're looking for a sport! :----D
Thank you for sharing <3. \nAlso what top are you wearing?
Thank you for sharing this video 💗
I'm so happy you made this video. I've always been chubby and struggled with food and my weight. Videos like this make me feel less alone. 💜
I can relate to this very well.  I was 7 when my grandfather started making advances towards me.  My parents were divorced, my dad mia and mother was in the navy.  I turned to food to cope with what I was going through.  I turned 18 and found out I had PCOS, a genetic disorder that makes it difficult to loose weight due to imbalanced hormones.  My relationship with food has been a constant war every day for 22 years.  I was anorexic, bulimic and obsessive compulsive with food.  It has been the longest  battle in my life.  Some days it feels all consuming.  I tried going vegan but found it triggered my ocd.  Thank you for sharing your story,  it's always heartwarming to hear similar stories from the other side.
Please be honest to yourself, If you have Cats and Dogs they still need food with meat and if you take or ever need any Medical procedure or medicine they also exist due to a lot of animal tests and pain, so you CAN'T disconnect as you think. Don't fool yourself. You not helping animals being a hypocritical human.
You are so inspiring Kiera, I love watching you videos 💖
I can really relate to you. From the year or so I've been watching your channel I would have assumed that you'd always been thin. I think you're beautiful and intelligent... even more so now that I see how alike we are.
Great to hear your story <3 I'm sure a lot can relate somehow to what you've told us now, I know I can. You should feel proud of yourself, you've done an amazing job
You have shown us all that it is still very difficult. You say that you didn't want to talk about food on your channel but it really is one of the reason why all of us are here, we listen to you and look up to you, you are beautiful inside and out and you have inspired me to be better and helped me become Vegan. Please keep going and continue with this channel and talk about yourself and food, its brilliant! You're brilliant!
Hey try this before they are all gone! I had AMAZING success losing weight with garcinia extract. It burns fat, gives you energy and stops you from being hungry all the time.

Hey Keira ❤️ thank you so much for this video - it hit home a lot for me as I've also struggled in the past (and I continue to even now)! About your What I Eat videos... please don't listen to the negative comments. These videos actually really helped me with my journey towards veganism because I saw how realistic your diet was. It was nothing too fancy, nothing expensive... I remember watching once of your videos where you do a vegan Tesco shop and I remember thinking wow actually it looks really easy to be vegan! You just buy more vegetables!. So yeah, it made the vegan diet seem much more do-able for me and is probably one of the bigger things that helped me push forwards in the right direction with my diet/morals :) I'm super glad you are feeling better about everything and I hope you continue to feel better every day :)
What a brave thing for you to do. I really appreciate your honesty and I'm so happy to hear you're feeling so much better. My ED has the tightest hold over me. It's videos like this one that give me hope that one day, I too can be happy within. Thank You so much. Xxx
I related to this so much. Thank you for making this video 💖
Eurgh I love you. Thank you so much for you being you!! 🍄
I found a lot more things that I would eat at others peoples houses too!
Going vegetarian has made me be way less of a picky eater. I am way more willing to try new foods.
thank you for this video keira, you're the best!!
Veganism changed my relationship with food too! And I'm so grateful to you for recommending the minimalist Baker as I can finally cook 😂. After hating exercise my entire life I have now joined a kickboxing gym and the impact it has had on my mental health is amazing. I feel the best I've ever felt, a workout works better than any anti depressant I've ever taken and I can't believe it!
I would have never known this side to you💭 thanks for sharing🙂 You are definitely one of the reasons why I started thinking more about vegan choices/ meals, and why I one day want to transition completely into that eating lifestyle !x
I really struggle trying to be Vegan and working full time 😔😔
Can I just say you are look absolutely stunning!!!! Thank you so much for this video. I’ve been struggling with food and my since I had my son 9 months ago, I’m vegetarian but because I’m so busy with my son and work I find it easier to just eat crap like a bag of crisps. But your video has inspired me to eat more fruit and vegetables and home cooked meals.
Aw Kiera! Thank you so much for sharing your story. Though you and I had different journeys (duhhhh different people), I feel exactly the same about veganism. It was like as soon as I started eating vegan, all the other problems I had went away. I stopped wanting to be thinner, restricting, calorie counting and just eat whatever I want, when I want. Everyone’s always saying how good I look physically, though I do regularly exercise now too. If you want any tips on how to get the ball rolling on exercising on the reg pls let me know. Sending love to you and Alex xx
Nothing better, or healthier, than a delicious, juicy sirloin steak from a 7 week+ hung side of beef.
I love your food videos ! They motivate me so much to eat better & to cook more & I love seeing meal ideas !
I ❤️ you so much Kiera ❤️❤️
What a brilliant video Kiera, huge respect for you for opening up about something so personal. I’ve had huge up and downs with food and my weight and have chronic ibs which makes things even more difficult! Have been wanting to go vegan myself for a long time but with ibs it’s extremely difficult and I haven’t found a way yet. Our relationships with food are such a complicated thing and the focus is always on weight loss above everything so thank you for talking about it from a different angle.
I too find it so hard  to motivate myself to exercise! It'd be great if you could share your journey when you get started ... it really is a mountain to climb ... Does Alex exercise? It's lovely he became vegan with you. Thank you for your videos!
I don't eat fruit. I eat pretty much all veg, but can't get over the fruit mental block :( hopefully one day
I adore you. And I love your what-i-eat-in-a-day videos so much more than most others, because they include a variety of foods of all kinds.
Thank you for producing such an honest video about food. I too had a big problem with textures of food growing up and it is nice to hear someone talking about it! I completely agree than Minamilist Baker is a life saver - has opened my eyes as well. I have only been vegan for 4 months now and have been enjoying getting to know you through your channel. It takes a lot of courage to go online and talk about these things and I really respect you for having the confidence to do so.
I didnt get my weight loss ca. 1,5 years after I went vegan. All the other people mentioned it to me and they still do. Sure, I realized I could downsize my wardrobe here and there in the sizes I needed to buy. I still don't weigh myself. That's what I stopped since I moved out from my parents house. Avery helpful video. Thank you Kiera. All the love. <3
Wow this helped me a lot and opened my eyes. I'm vegetarian and I stress over a lot and I found myself gaining weight rather then losing it. Then again my diet isn't the greatest.. but you've inspired me. I honestly always wanted to go vegan and I will get there one day but thanks for inspiring me!❤️❤️❤️
Just found you through this video loved it I wish I wash brave enough to talk about weight mental health and veganism on youtube but I love watching videos about it 💗
I think your food videos are really awesome! You show that you can eat what ever tasty food you want when you go vegan and you're not hard on your self and you show it for what it is, delicious! Anyone who's is vegan and promoting it is admirable. Not everyone needs or wants to be a health guru. You do you!! You're doing great work.
oh my god, thanks a lot for sharing.
Veganism is so beneficial in so many different ways!\n\nLoved this video <3
You look So gorgeous in this video!
Thank you for sharing this, Kiera!\n\nI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that - as you said - cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.\n\nRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy! :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you! ^^
My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)\nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) \nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx
Self defence classes? Hell yeah, become more like Xena!
I love this. I relate to this so much and I can say right now, my relationship with food is not the greatest. No one would even consider me fat but I was very overweight when I was younger and I still tend to feel like a little fat girl this was inspiring.
I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year! I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions! It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food! Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic! I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you!
Thank you for this video. My eating disorder history is different but it is nice to see that you have gotten better and made progress. Seeing you talk about it and how it got easier is really encouraging.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm on my own journey to resolving my life long issues with exercise and food and it is so inspiring to see someone who has gone through simillar struggles and has come so far. No matter how many videos I watch of super healthy exercise and diet people I watch I never know where to begin but your channel actually makes it seem possible. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone.
Ah I’m so proud of you! (And Alex!) thank you for sharing this with us 💕 you’re so amazing and definitely continue to inspire me. I’ll forever love your videos, super chill and feels like I’m hanging with my friend ❤️ (I’ve stuck around since your red hair days! And your pink/ purple fringe and blue hair days lol) so glad you’ve stuck with YouTube. Thank you 😊 much love 💕
This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. ❤️ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING 😅.) Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. ❤️
Thank you for talking about it. It is really meaningful for me.
I've been subscribed to you for years now. I relate to you on so many levels. This video however just blew my mind. Our stories are so unbelievably similar. Thank you for  being brave enough to share your experiences. And thank you for normalising and demistifying veganism as much as you do. You, and your videos, are very much appreciated ❤️
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included 😊
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu 😞 I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ❤
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change 😜😜 have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you’ve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
At 21 years old I’ve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‘fussy’ with food like me. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn’t even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It’s so reassuring hearing that you’ve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing 💗 your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals 💗
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
you look beautiful and your so brave x
You are an amazing person Kiera!!! Keep on being fab x
You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ❤
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them 👌🏽
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo

*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant 👏🏻💕
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.
<3
❤️❤️❤️
I like food
Vegan trending? What the hell.
You're amazing💜
Love u 💓

Brave girl x
❤❤❤❤❤
It’s nice to see a vegan, and I know not all vegans are like this but they do exist, who doesn’t force veganism down non vegans throats because they see it as a superior way of life when they a lot of the time themselves are restricting their diets so much they have border line eating disorders that are not healthy and sustainable in the long run. She just seems to natural and real like a normal vegan with a diet that is healthy and makes her happy, it’s nice. Sorry for the paragraph just thought I would say 😂
Ah white ppl problems\nIf I was middle class I'd make more important videos
someone pls report that sex comment i dont know
how the fuck is this trending gtfo

Most can detect only between light and dark, while others have well-developed vision.\nMe: .......THAT'S RIGHT! MY SPIDER IS NOT LIKE MOST SPIDERS IT'S DIFFERENT AND HAS 4 FUCKING EYES.

OMG instead of spending money on farts lol. You should donate the money to animals shelters instead.
Why would eBay sell this stuff
She looks like the girl who thought that earth is flat. But with blonde hair instead of black
I have so many questions\n\n\n\n\nWhy? Why am I watching this? How the frick did I get here from a k-pop music video? Why does this video even exist?

,,This fart was $20,,   This is new.
Anyone else waiting for a fart in a jar worth it
I think this might be a sign that buzzfeed is running out of ideas...
Do you think that's a reasonable amount to pay?....\nNo. It's literally a jar, Johanna. XD Savage.
Count how many times she said fart
drinking game = everytime she says Fart you have to drink a shot
I will fart in this jar! I will do it!😂😂😂😂
Take a shot every time she says fart.
I find myself watching the weirdest things sometimes..
Why do I even go to college....I could just trade my farts on Ebay...
I dunno about a jar, but I know a foam seat cushion with hold one!
Ahaha someone ran out of ideas

4:07 name song?
Cyborg: The ride ain't over yet\nAquaman: My man! \n\nThat's some damn good script writing! I can't wait for the dynamic between them!
Did NOT like Man of Steel or Batman v. Superman. Watching Justice League to support Wonder Woman 💪👌🏻
Kind of looks like Darkseid is the main villain here.\nJust my speculation.
Movie looks stupid.   All DC movies suck.  Only way to make it decent is to have Stan Lee in charge....
That's not David Bowie... THIEF'S
m i the only one who is missing super man ;(
What I don't understand is why they took second rate actors to play Cyborg and Flash. They're both lovable characters and should have been played by actors well known/successful. People playing Wonder Woman and Batman as well as Superman are all accomplished actors. Especially, Gal Gadot. \nRegardless, the movie looks cool.
I really hope they compare power levels. I don’t think the Wonder Woman movie did her justice in terms of power scale. I want her and Supes to be the main powerhouses of the league
Can't stand the music. Great trailer though
Seriously where is Superman? Guess I'll see when the movie comes out.
Seriously.....Red Clouds....Fire...Shots....Man, this looks like a gameplay more than a trailer.....
2.27......... that smile will kill all man <3<3<3
Make a New JUDGE DREDD film!
Should've kept Christian bale as Batman
i see dc everywhere ... its in my blood....  a tiny drop can destroy the entire marvel universe
What the world really needs is a cyborg throwing a merman at some bugs
Am I the only one that likes the comic look of the CGI?
They will just protect the United states of America
Half this trailler is batman driving a car in a straight line
Anyone other than Aflak as Batman. :(
Partly equipment star comparison gas tend credit column adolescent house noise.
Dragon ball super episode 109-110 got more response than this duh... Justice league sucksss
for realsies though i could totally see matt daemon playing green lantern
2:16 All I can think of is the mailman from Rick And Morty...
Does any one actually believe superman is dead and is not in this film? Lol
These are the kind of themes they should have started all this with.
today is my bday so can you please watch this fr my bday presents https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5zlift4PDQ
I love D.C. and I'm sorry if u disagree but the flash [Ezra] will make a horrible flash Grant can be the only one ☝️. Maybe it's because I'm sooo used to Grant as the flash I rlly don't know but as soon as I saw grant wasn't gonna be the flash and then the Director talked about how he wouldn't fit in but yeah sorry if any of you want Ezra to be the flash just my opinion tho
Looks awesome my only gripe is the flash, makes me cringe every time he says a line just my opinion
When Superman comes back in JL, it should be  to Kryptons Theme from the original Superman Movie\nhttps://youtu.be/SWzzA-pgOAM
Man, they should have used Grant Gustin to play the flash in this movie. Why Ezra Miller though? 😑
I don’t get why everyone is trying to pick marvel or dc. I’m just happy I can look at the list of movies at the theatre and actually want to see something.
cant wait for every other action shot to be slow-mo
finally a trailer that doesn't reveal the whole plot
I hope all the songs from all the trailers is in the movie. they kind of fit the movie unlike the music of suicide squad. for example this song can be used as the suiting up song of them coming out of the batcave. then come together can be used when superman shows up and helps them fight Steppenwolf.
please......don't let this be another Suicide Squad
Nope. Still shitty. Will be as bad as Thor: Ragnarok. Let's all root for Blade Runner 2049 being the best movie of 2017. That's right, bin your crappy superhero movies DISNEY, WB and Sony.
Meh....I liked it better the first time....WHEN IT WAS CALLED THE AVENGERS!!!
I can't wait
I wanna watch that movie is gonna be amazing
Hey, look at that... Wonder Woman there as the video icon.  And she's SMILING.   Perhaps DC is finally learning.
since the moment 1:41, it is shown how all act alone and fail, but not Batman, because he is Batman.
Where's my Superman?
I just want to see a good batman film with Ben Affleck
I cant wait for this movie
Why Grant Gustin is not Flash in JL ???
Honestly I'm just happy for the true depiction of how DC heroes should be and act like, I'm sick of those emo weaklings in series like The Flash
Can't wait for the movie..!!
Batman looking at the Bat Signal while he stands there while the Bat Plane comes up, wow, so badass
Omg is that the guy from GOT?
Flash already my favorite character, always been.
Had to come wash my eyes after Thor and black panther
this movie going to be great
Honestly, they could do better for this trailer.
“The world needs Superman”
I thought the only one that can beat Superman was Charlie Puth 😂😂😂 just kiddin
Amy Adams is the worst choice for Lois Lane ever!
but where is the leader,where is green lantran???
All are fucks sucks
😍😍😍Gal Gadot
That smile at 2:28 💖
God I hate Amy Adams...
2:03\nMom!! How do we preorder movie tickets?
Where is SUPERMAN?
Where's spiderman?
My Man!
i cant wait
DC FINALLY GETS IT!!!
Aloud: please don't suck please don't suck please don't suck please don

They relally have to rethink their choice of music when it comes to movies.
Do any of you know the song played here? Thanks
Why on earth would they not cast the flash from the mad hit show The Flash in this.... Stupid life choice...
Grant Gustin is Better Flash :(
zack snyder is the shit, joss whedon is the fan.
WHAT YOU GUYS THINK ITS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST SURPRISE IN THIS MOVIE???
How many women had to get molested to get this movie made?
Total shit
Watch superman come at the very end of the movie , I will be pissed .....
This looks terrible and it's too pathetic
Does anyone know what the song they play in this trailer is called?
everyone looks up to you Clark. They listen to you. If you tell them to fight, they'll fight. But they need to be inspired. And let's face it, Superman...the last time you really inspired anyone -- was when you were dead.\n-batman
I missed the first 2 mins of the video and had to go back because I'm just staring at that perfect liner 😅 how do you do it Suzie! I got the nude bow jumper too and the cape coat I love it haha! <3
We have the same aviator jacket 😬 I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!🙌🏻 Cute Haul!!!
Don’t keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn’t really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ✨
The shearling jacket is SO CUTE!
Me encantaron todas las prendas  <3
She looks like she's coping off Zoella
Olivy, bat wingy, nudy, cardy, camelly, syntheticy, plasticy.....?????
https://youtu.be/DZVJC6guVaY
Love your suede jacket 🌷
Aviator jacket camel jumper and green cardigan are gorgeous. You have lovely style suzie x
Great haul!💖👌
love the herringbone scarf!!
getting that beanie for sure!!
where your earrings from?
Love the cardigans
Happy birthday
pls do more zara haul!!! ♥️
Great cosy haul! My favourite was actually the cape coat but I think it was a bit too big for you, so a size down and in a navy would be dreamy!
Love your try on hauls 💚 saludos desde Argentina! 💚😘
Loved every single item you bought!! Super cute and cozy!!
How tall are you?
what do you wear on your lips? The color is so beautiful!!
Where is your choker from? Xx
The jeans you’re wearing are fab! Where did you get them?
I like your videos...but I suggest something...you explain everything really well...no need to re-explain when you try them on...you takes ages on every item...loved everything you picked up...👍
Ooh lovely haul. You must have been totally in the zone. The red jumper, colour is amazing on you and the grey pearl hat is fabulous. Grey  jumper makes the gold earrings pop and the aviator jacket makes me want to go and try one on. Am not a fan of batwing stuff for myself as they are pain to wear under coats though.
I love scarves!!! I'm obsessed with them! 🙈
You're so beaut! Thanks for sharing your haul!
Hi Suzie, Love your video. Thank you. Please can you share where your jeans are from? They are lovely!! Xx
Those jeans ! Where is it from ??? 😍 your body👌
loved this haul! recently did a little shopping at Zara as well! :)
My faves were the grey and camel scarf, and the camel jumper! Oh and the cream cardigan😍🙋💛Been looking for one like that for a while! 💖💖
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe 😩
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! 🍁
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul 😍💜
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. 😂
everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! 😍🍂
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!😍
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not 😂 love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely 😍
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you 😍😍
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!
girl im buying every single jumper, cardigans, scarves, and that suede jacket yesssss I love all of them so cosy and pretty and pretty much my style for every autumn and winter season cause dang its cold up here in the north of america 😅☁️🌧🌨🌦☔️
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the “cape style” coat at the end doesn’t sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! 🙈
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist 😍😍💗
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we’re still waiting for the cold in New York 😭
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn’t think it was worth it. Also didn’t have any washing instructions in it 🙈
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haul💕
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ❤️👍🏻💕
Makeup tut on this look please
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
Stupid little puppy claws... seriously disappointing?
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colors😂
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!💜
What jeans are you wearing?
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. 👌 Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
Where are your jeans from? x
Do you actually try things on in store?
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it’s out of stock :’(
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
Where is this lipstick from? :)
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
I just want subs
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these
Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Her youtube channel is called helloOctoberxo...?
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!
4:49 Sean: That's my style! Andy: Okay, whatever you say, junior.
@6:54 There were no Mustang's in the 1950s. The first production year was 1965.
Love sushi....hate wasabi.
1950s mustang XD
I'm a fan, but - I just don't think the world needed another white people learn to make sushi in ten minutes short, you know? I feel like it's been done and done and *done* at this point.
8:31 That's much better than at the truck stop.  Sean, open up a sushi truck stop.
No such thing as a 1950s mustang. They came out in 1964
lose the playa watch please!
Hey guys. Commenting here so I can plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi, one of the greatest sushi documentaries out there, and quite possibly one of the greatest documentaries of all time. You guys should definitely take the time to watch it. That's all.
more of a snowflake situation. killed me
sean is not even fun to watch. boring hipster dressing motherfucker
The chef reminds me of Adam Sandler for some reason
I really enjoyed the video, but you don't need to stay in character all the time. This segment seemed a little forced.
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Mustangs didn’t exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a “round 1950’s mustang”.
He has so much pride about making sushi it’s very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
watch more great video on Indian cooking click photo
“Like a 1950’s mustang” he says. Too bad they debuted in 1964😑😑
I'm going to pretend you meant a 50's P51 Mustang and not the car, seeing as how the fish on the rice kinda looks like the body of a P51!
You're such a good host
Can you invite Pewdiepie again?\nI know the first time you invited him! But he turned you down because he's busy!
Honestly super proud of Sean. Great work! 
Where did you see a 1950s mustang?
Man, Sushi *looks* SO good..... Alas, tis not. lol
Chef was a champ, seems like a cool dude
Next Hot ones we need Hot Ones: with ROADMAN SHAQ PLEASE LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN SEE IT
In school I used to always question why the things we were learning were relevant to our us. Now I willfully click on these kinds of videos...
There are five things we teach\n\n*names 4 things
You better not replace Sean ever, or you'll lose all your subs
Shawn is my favorite internet personality rn, so genuine and funny. Thank you for the content !!!
great series, love how he was honest with the ratings lol
how does someone who knows nothing to little about preparing food get a food show???\n*white privilege
nope, no raw fish for me, i dont want vibrio cholerae in me
@0:35 THAT ACTION POSE!
Remove your watch before cooking.
You fucked up the tuna! :'(
little finger action... \n \nsean, you tease...
64 sean. mustangs... 64 man..
jheez that looks good
Hair net? What hair net?
aaaaaaah i need some sushi now
Anyone realize this guy appeared in GMM Crew ep with mike and Alex and they made sushi like the spider one
Does Sean do any stand up comedy? I'd love to see some of that
A little finger action?
What watch is that sean
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
#ricegumisabitch
Little finger action? Uh huh.
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant 😆
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing 😂 mustangs became a car in 1964.5
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Does Jiro use a fughkeng blowtorch?!?!
My favorite host
The secret to good sushi is bad fish. C'mon, guys.
Honestly if Sean made my sushi I wouldn't know if he was a pro or a rookie lolol
here's what I don't understand, why scale the fish if you're going to fillet it? what was the point of scaling if you're cutting the skin off the flesh anyway?
3:26 Never heard of a straight bass Sean
Sean that watch though!!!
lol 1950's Mustang
1950 mustang?
1950s mustang
Sushi quality looks fetching terrible
Great interview!
1960s* mustang, sean.
Hahahaha awesome.. tnx Sean this was entertaining :)
this was awesome!
1950s Mustang?
Did these motherfuckers just sushi-fy a fucking striper???
nice gold watch
Best channel!
damn that big ass watch !
isn't that the sushi chef from gmm? xd
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
It made me think of those inflatable, dancing  cheese-string-looking things at fairs 😂
ok so she's funny. Like really funny.
This is by far the funniest video you've ever posted!
Cristine and Saf have such a cute friendship ❤
I took the jacket to meet a friend I burst out laughing. Too funny
Taking ‘sweaterpaws’ to a whole new level.
“I’m not saying I’m good enough to be hired but I’m good enough to work for free” 😂
Ehh if it was like 20$ I'd wear it :,))\n\nI kinda like it
I found jeans for your next video! Dare I say they might be the ugliest yet! https://www.facebook.com/HahahaLetsLaugh/photos/a.701775023186303.1073741826.557235980973542/1666556946708101/?type=3
next you should give hairy leggings a try
Can I just say that I was more impressed by you wearing a return tag attached to your clothing... for a whole week :D
I thought  it looked pretty cute actually when you wore it with the dress or skirt or whatever
When you started Devil Wears Prada-ing it. omg I'm going to die laughing.....As long as you don't need to eat or be perceived as a normal human... lol I can't breathe...This is like the jacket from hell. Yay for Disney though...Also Cristine :D
I freaking loved this video, man alive that is amazing. oh you made me laugh. so so many time xD
This amused me way more than I expected.
Designer be like: Shit, I got a pair of jeans left, why don't I just sew that onto a jacket and see if anyone jumps on the hype bus?
You should trying wearing Indian clothes for a week and see what people think
I had the same jacket 18 years ago from Giordano; yes, that was almost 2 decades ago. It was sold for around 25usd. How they marketed the jacket was to roll them up to your wrist, much like any other regular denim jacket and no one would be the wiser of its full couture potential...until it met you. Best video I've watched on YouTube this week, you've outdone yourself, Safiya. *claps claps*
Wondering how weird her closet's looking
I would've worn the t-shirt with the tutu sash.
10/10 would buy it just to smack people with it as I walk past them.
Sounds like/rhymes with net-ah-por-tay.  It's a play on prêt-à-porter, ready-to-wear which is in contrast to couture (tailored to and created for you specifically).\n\nJust fyi.  😉
It looks like you have 4 legs
I would wear the first one for when I have to shake hands with others. I don't do handshakes Or contact with others or eye contact
Later in the week, I went to visit a friend I had to shubscribe!!! Loves it!!
i watched this and u made me feel better thank u for making me lol
THIs whole video is what us short people feel like when we buy anything long sleeved. XD
Ben wasn't fazed by it because he's so used to the weird shit Cristine does lol. Also, I was so worried you would miss the opportunity to tie it down like a straight jacked, but thankfully Cristine delivered!
Oh yeah I bought this jacket and cut the sleeves off
not lying I would wear that I love the sleeves
Hey, Saf, I have been watching your fashion videos and I find them HILARIOUS! As for the jacket, tho, there are many other ways to wear it (especially if you weren't able to return it). Like button the buttons, don't wear the sleeves and tie them around your chest (and maybe a t-shirt or a shirt inside). I think that questionable image of the jacket (fortunately) is not the only way to wear it and this way it can be much better (or so I imagine). Keep cool :)
You made it look so good lol
Dollskill has a ton of stuff with sleeves like this right now :P
This is definitely my favourite video of yours, you're so funny
iN tHiS rOoM *is outside*
are you sure thats a jacket?
Just trim the sleeves if you Dont want it to be long anynore
Some fitting jeans to complete the outfit - https://imgur.com/gallery/nMhXvem
Beyonce wore this kind of jacket on her instagram. It was a long jacket cuffed up
You should try the glossy eye trend!!!
got to love your confidence to wear such weird stuff in public!!!! good on you!
Okej so this happened https://www.instagram.com/p/BaSyJJhnoiu/ the matching shirt
I can see you just swinging it around and let it hit the people that think it’s ugly 😂😂 and girl I can also see you saying “anything that’s on my damn body always look good bitch” 😂😂😂
NEXT VIDEO IS I WEAR SUPER LONG NAILS FOR A WEEK and i mean dUPER DUPER LONG OK
You're so pretty :O I don't like denim, but it looks very pretty on you.
What happens if you're short and it's raining? >.<
what brand of jeans do you buy?
The more uncomfortable you seem, the wealthier you are. #hmm
This video made me so extremely uncomfortable that I couldn't watch it but i love all ur other videos
CRISTINE OUT OF HER MAIN HABITAT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
This was a good video until crisrein showed up
Safiya, you're hilarious and you rocked that jacket!
That laugh at 1:38 😂
At Disney her skirt flew up
this video made my day. after laughing so much :) love saf so much. she is truly one of a kind.
There are hairy leggings and once I saw them I thought Saf would wear these so here you go
You should wear all the “ugly” stuff for a day  or week
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE SAF GOT HER MINI BACKPACK. I NEED IT 4:07
One spin and everyone is getting slapped
Oh my god, I could not BREATHE for the day seven jacket. This is the hardest I've ever laughed at one of your videos.
you should wear heelys for a week!!
also saf looks like those car wash advertising blowing figures (completely unsure what these are called oops)
Lol me when I try on those type of jackets
i think the next invention will be mom jeans with clear patches on the butt
am i the only one who noticed she had to blur her butt while twirlling. i love her so much XD
8:41 reminds me of when Mulan was trying to drink Tea in her matchmaker scene xD
Hey guys pleaseee check out my account. Im trying really hard to get some viewsss. ONLY POSIIVE COMMENTS PLEASE. Thanks I love all my fans and really once I'm famous you can say you subscribed first. ANyway love you guys. I love magic school bus so my username and alias is based off of that
5:26 made me laugh like crazy 😂 I loved that
I live for saf's cute weird dances lol
You should make a video of all of your ugliest clothes that you've done and put them all together
i completely lost it when you started dancing with the flailing tube man, oh my lord
_Have you ever worried about your sleeves falling down when you wash your hands?_ *_WELL,THIS IS THE JACKET TO DRIVE YOU INSANE_*
If you weren’t gonna return it... why keep the tag on it?
At 5:28 i laughed soo hard, that I couldn't breathe 😂😂
She’s so beautiful
5:27. I died!! 😂😂😂
namjoon?
12:29 Luna Lovegood of 2017
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legit my OCD is telling me roll those FUCKING  sleeves!!!!
I laughed til I choked at the wacky inflatable tube man part
QUEEEEEEEEEEN! LOVE YOUR VIDS! THESE ONES ARE AMAZING!
GOT7 looked good with overlong sleeves...
5:27 HAHAHA made my day <3
SLENDERMAN JACKET
Hahhhahaha that dance😂
10:48 when Saf says simply nailogical but someone types simply illogical :D
Jenderman
“I’m Edward Denim Hands”
10:43 DEAD 💀 😂
omg i laughed so hard!!!!
TRY CRUGGS (crocks+uggs)
edward denim hand lol
This is my fav
Ugliest sunglasses?
Haha Safiya at 5:30
Just fold the sleeves.
Saf, you’re beauty with brains.
When you've already shanshed those buttons
How is the porg cute?  I don't get it...
so an unoriginal movie. Star Wars is ruined.I'm out.
Pablo Hidalgo tweeted MONTHS ago; \nI don't understand all this Grey Jedi talk. It's the light side, the dark side, and that's it. There is no Grey\n\nI foresee ALOT of disappointed theorists in our future. \n\nI guess this is what happens when fans have NOTHING but time between episodes to make predictions and speculation. \n\nI would say, I'm not hating on the people who speculate! but that wouldn't be true. \n\nI'm letting Lucasfilm fill in the blanks for me. As they have since 1977. They created this thing I hold so dear.
Everyone be like, oh can't watch the trailer! Can't spoil it!\n\n\nMe: @nerdist TEAR THAT $*!T APART.
How many times will Pablo Hidalgo have to tell you Gray Jedi dont exist!? Stop perpetuating the myth!
I think a BIG detail was missed: Luke's fear!
I love how she pretends to give a fuck about all of this xD
Great job Amy on this episode of Nerdist News!
She talks too fast the first half.  She needs to pace and breathe.  Outside of that, it cracks me up all this crying over Jessica, happens every time she isn't in the video lol
I can't wait for Dec., but seen this new trailer it as the look of a rehash Empire Strikes Back like with The Force Awakens from a New Hope. basically The Empire/New Order & Rebel/Resistance still haven't learn from history. they might have new tech, but still essentially stuck in a loop.
What about the line which Luke says about raw power ?
I bet she has a HUUUGE vagina
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The grey jedi crap goes against EVERYTHING.
I didn't miss shit!
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it’s going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that’s just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! 😍 In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! 😊
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe’s Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke’s Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
Hey! Nice Vault-Tec dress/shirt(?)!
Star Wars: Return of the Mary Sue
#TEAM CHEWBACCA because he is going to eat that stupid porg thing lol

Quality Review Nerdist!
Wheres jessica
kristal fox
Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn’t on makes me queasy.
Why do the US and UK trailers have different middles.. THIS CHRISTMAS or THIS DECEMBER around the 1min 20 mark...
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
Bring back jessica
You guys should play Cat Mario :3

DAN YOU DON'T NEED TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, YOU ARE PERFECTLY GORGEOUS WITH YOUR NATURAL CURLY HAIR 😍😍😍😍😍 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE DON'T GO OUT OF MY LIFE ❤❤❤❤
your nails!!!!! i am so in loveeee!
PINOF... capitalized because it's an acronym but also I'm screaming it due to excitement
Love his nails matching his shirt so much xx
those are!!! my favourite flowers!!!! and im a Mentally Ill (tm)!!! NICE
DO A VIDEO WHEN YOU DO EACH OTHERS NAILS AND MAKE UP AND PICK EACH OTHERS CLOTHES
Young minds is our school charity
i live for when they are together they are great
I don't have any yellow clothes either.(not because I'm depressed or something I just don't like yellow its annoying)
omfg when dan told ella it's going to be alright, that made me so happy bc my names ella and i have had a bad day and that was all i needed so thank you so much to dan for that i love him!!!!!!
my school didn't talk about mental health issues at all
wasn't the 10th a Tuesday?
what if the thing in the calendar is going to be a dog ???
Is there somewhere i can donate to from switzerland (not in the eu) ?
Ooo Dan throwing shade at the demons is my new kink
I noticed their voices were slightly lower in the bloopers video and I was very confused!!!
I’m loving the yellow nails 😍
Am I the only one who's still waiting for the scented candle haul ..
k but how does he blow up the balloon so easily
This is completely unrelated but there was a teacher called mr Howell who started working at my school, let’s just say that phandom in my school didn’t stop
If Dan was my therapist, he'd probably cry alongside me in the corner.
The cheese dress is back
He looks so cute in this
So I was planning to comment all the yellow emojis for support but then I realized that every symbol, every emoji is yellow so here is my best: \n\n😀😃😄😆😁😅🤣😂☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍😘😗😙😚😋😜😝😝😛🤑🤗🤓😏😒😞😔😔😟😖😣🙁😕😫😩😤😠😶😐😑😯😦😳😵😲😮😧🙄🤔🤥😬😬🤐🤧😷🤒🤕😺😸😹😿🙀😽😼😻😾👏✊️👎👊👍🤝🤛🤜🤞✌️🤘👇👌👈✋️🤚🖐🖖🖐✍️👋👶👱👴👵👨👲👷‍♀️👷👨‍⚕️👩‍🌾👨‍🌾👩‍🍳🐥🐤🐣🐯🐝🌻🌼🌗🌘🌖🌕🌒🌓🌔🌝🌙🌜🌛🌞💫⭐️🌻🌼✨🌟⭐️⚡️✨☀️🌤🌦🍋🌽🧀🍯🍟🥇🎖🏅🏆🏵🎗🎷🎺⚱️🛎🔑📯✏️📴📳🈶🈚️🈸☣️☢️🉑🆚✴️🈷🈺🔅🔆〽️⚠️🚸⚜️🔱🔔🔕📣 \n\nOff to do it on Twitter now
i suffer from anorexia, it is inspiring to hear that people care about mental illness. thank you Dan and Phil for this video. every one blames me that its my fault that I could anorexic but I never asked for this, it just arrived and now it eats away at me making me believe things that are not real. I want to get win and get better but its so hard. video's like this help to encourage people suffering, it gives them hope I guess. it makes them realise that people do care. thanks for the video guys. :)
Nail polish is harder than it looks!! ha!
Huh, now I know why my favorite color has always been yellow
Why did my school not teach us about this
I just got my master's degree in mental health counseling (well almost, I am about to defend my thesis and then I will be done with my degree) and I think mental health is sooooo important! Thank you for speaking about this!! <3
Snowpiercer is my favorite movie, omg it's so under rated
#1: Answer the door. #2: Come upstairs in the cheese costume. Geez, peer pressure much? I would totally tell my bf that, I might get hit in the head for it, but she'd probably accommodate me. She's nice like that. Sometimes. Best friends are meant to torment each other. It's a fact. The fact that they can understand you is a bonus. Domesticity at its finest. Oh and  nice he ordered milkshake(s)....I mean are you even surprised anymore?
When he turns his chair to his left the screen gets more yellow and normal colored, but when he turns to the right the screen goes purple
Dan!  you can use rubbing alcohol, instead of nailpolish remover!
💛We💛love💛you💛Dan💛and💛Phil💛never💛change💛
I had a councillor at school because people took the mic out of my name and the guy didn't even know my name. It made matters worse .
My best friend had depression after being bullied, and I have anxiety. Thanks Dan, this helps to know that you care.
Omg their calendar is gonna be with the Howlter family
but what if you joke about your mental illnesses to help you cope?
Guys I need the name of the anime he recommended is it new yokyo? Help
the only counselor available in my town or anywhere nearby is infamous for gossiping and breaking confidentiality. I need something, but I literally have no options. There are school counselors but that's not a thing I can do on a regular basis.
ACK I missed it, and I have mental health problems...
omg wait, why didnt i think of this earlier? Dan x Cole, i mean imagine the beautiful babies that they would make
you should do a baking dan vs phil
my bet there is animals in the new calendar
I had such awful experiences with councilers and all my counciling experiences were so strange and didnt feel very comfortable or helpful. If you had the same problem with therapy youre not alone please dont worry. 🖤 Things will be alright.
W H O L E S O M E
Snow piercer took a lesson from Jonathan swift??? 😖
I fricking missed world mental health day AGAIN fricking hell
I literally had a breakdown over my anxiety the other day and then my mom went on a tangent on how I’m “ just trying to be cool “ and that I “ don’t have anxiety. “ god I wish people would realize that ANXIETY ISNT COOL and it’s extremely difficult to deal with.

Dan painted his nails.\nThat's it, my life is completed. I can finally die at peace.\nrip
DAN WITH PAINTED NAILS JESUS AMEN SCREE E E  LIKE IF YOU AGREE
this is one of the many reasons I love you <3
aww he was blushing so much when he spoke about phil painting his nails, this is so wholesome
when they smile it makes me happy
People I've talked to go on about depression like it's a choice, or like it's some sin, or they think those who are depressed are weak. I try to tell them otherwise, but they go on like they know what it's all about when really, they have no clue.
Out school is shit they told us it was wmhd then just started to shout about attendance for a school trip 🙄🙄🙄😂

He paints his fingers with a close precision
I wish I had a soulmate that would order me a milkshake
I actually got so sad randomly that I almost cried for no reason a few minutes ago. Do I have depression?
HIS NAILS
Is it just me or does Dan's skin look flawless in this video
Still wishing you'd worn the Pooh Onesie, our cuddly wee Bear.
WTF you got the same results as Harry Potter.
I like your nails Danny boy :))
When I took the pottermore hat sorting quiz i got a choice between ravenclaw and slytherin!

Could have been much heavier without the background synths in the drop. Think it takes away from the power. First drop >>
I really enjoyed this! Blasterjaxx saves Spinnin' once again.
Where can I find the lyrics for this music?
Awesome track
Who also like this one?
You Back Yourself\n🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
I like this music just too short the drop :c
The drop not bad tho, but still prefer big room from blasterjaxx
Where's the I love it  button?
It's good, the drop could've been better
Long time... Blasterjexx that's what I want from you... Insane beats
And once again they make something that has never been heard before, this is not human anymore :o
Kinda sad that blasterjaxx is making this type of music, Ik it’s a one off but this type of genre doesn’t really suit them.
Very different from blasterjaxx. I wanna see him do some trance or chill step or bro step.
Bizarre mean weird in french
Totally Different what I was expecting from Blasterjaxx.
I always told myself Future Bass is too operated but this is just Bizarre!
blasterjaxx? future bass?    I LIKED <3

h main does whistler 2018??????????????
these will save yer ankles dude, I used them loads recovering from similar impacts down hilling \n... http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/s?q=sixsixone+ankle+support&cat=direct
Camelback
#36 on trending 👌
Mr main
Muddy fox is shit ngl
Yo what brand joggers
Nice undies
Go to Halfords
Ooo
Go outdoors do hydration packs
high ankle sprain probably man
Evoc for the backpack 100%
Harry keep safe man!
Que buen vergazo!!
Damn!! Bro get better soon 💯✊️
Lovin the mtb content
those are some sweet thigh tattoos
Get an Osprey backpack
I
Get clip pedals
http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Land-Rover-Discovery-3-4-Range-Rover-Sport-Quick-Release-Tow-Bar-GENUINE-Oem-/142497372955?hash=item212d815b1b:g:w8cAAOSw~AVYnyYY
Ffs you bought shit,  you need fox or tld brand clothing
Find good matcjing gloves
Go to eBay for towbar
gumtree or ebay
Looking FRESH!  Yes lad.
Upgrade your rocker
I always enjoy watching your videos but on this one the only thing we was looking a was the ground I think you need your go pro a bit higher on your helmet, just what I think that's all lol
Muddy fox is a decent brand for mtb but you would be better with like fox or alpine stars. I wear alpine stars because they're amazing for long endure rides especially for jumps and stuff
what a little bitch? you just hurt your foot? so what...  lease you can still ride and live a normal life and not of had to have operations and long recovery, STILL recovery ill say like poor scotty cranmer...try being in his shoes mate and show some respect to him.your crash isnt serious/worth crying over, you will live, get over and fuck you
That looked so painful get well harry 😔
You look a twat in that
Range Rover comes with a tow bar 😂there is controls in the boot to release it and it folds out
Make sure you lock the bikes with a chain if you end up with a bike rack , been known for bikes to get nicked even at traffic lights when on racks
No you haven't broken your ankle it's just in a cast 🙄
Dude I work for Land Rover @champagnejolag that's my insta DM me I'll hook it up
EVOC Back packs for the win every time !!
get  universal tow bar in have a range rover and it works excellent mate
Harry those 2 holes on you tow hitch are for the safety chains on a trailer. Incase a trailer comes off the tow hitch ball, the safety chains wiith hooks stay connected and insure the trailer doesn't go into on coming traffic, hit a person or a building etc. You want a tow hitch bike rack like this. It'll slide right in to the square receiver n fastened with a big pin ..... \n https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-Racks/Thule/TH990XT.html?feed=npn&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIofbev_jp1gIVQWSGCh1JkAubEAQYBCABEgKO2fD_BwE\nThule make good hitch racks. Hope this helps.
*HARRY hit up Cannock Chase!* Best place I've been to for Mountain Biking!!\nhttp://www.chasetrails.co.uk/
Doing sick bro keep up the good work
Harry, get the space brace for your ankles when you ride. They will save your ankles! Also help you get revived.
I am so glad harry is keeping it like his channel in stead of worrying about youtubes rules! Cheers!
you can purchase a bike rack that just sicks right into the square hole in the back.
its a bit shit mate, got to a mountain bike specific store and there get you the baller shit you need man!
That was one of the funniest vids I've ever seen!! Good start with the Enduro gear, just stay away from Spprts Direct next time. Have a ganders at Endura clothing on Chain Reactin Cycling.
Parking over two spaces like a twat
Harry!!!! You don’t need glasses bro, just bang on a sick set of goggles with your full face 😜
Why don't you get a roof rack for the bike
thumbs up for nandos (SA for the win)
There is a tow hitch already on it. Just removed that plastic blocking the hitch and you can use your bike rack.
the riding shorts are good  but maybe invest in better jerseys, those ones look like they are for cross country, also an enduro helmet would help.. For example ( troy lee designs A2 helmet) having longer shorts is better too,  the jacket is good.
for your towbar try Caravan and Camping/ towers in southport
You have a hitch on your Sport already mate.  All you need is a bike rack now, it will go right into the existing receiver.\n\nSomething line this would work https://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/car-specific-accessories/buzz_rack_bb4_4_bike_wheel_support_rack_no_brp304/Qx%40w%2C6M42VAwp3%40Rb%7B~cC4ure5HXEB\n\nGood luck with the ankle and the date bro!
Nice little fear and loathing in Las Vegas look! Yesslad
Get a tld Jersey they're the best
Holy shit mate, i sprained my ankle on a second degree and y have a friend that hurt it 4th degree, and now you!, we were joking that hurting your ankle was the new trend. Its fkin nuts. What up with the global energy or wtf is going on, too many synchrinicities
A Thule should just slide right into that hitch that's already on your car. And I'd definitely get a neck brace for downhill riding. If you go head first into a tree without one you'll for sure fuck ur shit up.
The square in the middle is the tow hitch receiver...typically you'd slide a trailer hitch w/ ball mount in there to tow a trailer, but they make bike racks that slide right in there as well, similar to this  https://cdn1.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/90/45/t2_classic_wloc_9044_9045_sized_750x492.jpg
You already have a receiver hitch, which is the squareish opening back there, which is what all bike racks insert into anyways. Get a North Shore style rack or a tray rack. North Shore mounts the bikes so the sit vertically long ways. Tray rack they just sit by the wheels horizontally. North Shore rack would be my personal opinion any day as you can hold way more bikes and they don't extend out so bloody far, so they are sturdier and more compact so that you're less likely to back into things.
You already have a towing receiver. Just buy a bike rack that fits your (guessing) 2inch receiver.
Harry you need a hitch bike rack. You already have the hitch you just need the rack not a tow bar. US price is less than $100
get  full face helmet with the remove able chin piece there better for enduro type riding
Don’t get a Thule get a North shore rack they are much better
buy a thule bike rack or a roof rack for the MTB it will look steeazy and its not half that expensive
stretch the other side of your ankle.
check out the online store chain reaction cycles
You have a hitch receiver. Just get a 2 rack.  🤘
You should have gotten the TLD or FOX gear
Most hilarious video in a while or maybe I am just in a good mood.\nI feel Harry is back to having tonnes of fun and just doing things he loves!\n\nVery good to see my man, cannot wait to watch you shred some enduro in your new get up!
Go on chain reaction cycle if you want good deals on any mtb stuff
Hahahaha the ginger part. Sounded like u said shall I edit that hahahahahahah. Hilarious
I enjoy the mountain bike videos
your fucking quality man videos are sick.
for outdoor sports stuff go to decathlon if there is one near you not sports direct
Riding gear is right I'd just go to a local bike shop
hi harry i have some downhill trousers and a top you can have . the top is a large and the trouser are a small to medium they were only used a couple of times . they are in good nic. let me know if you want them
Check out the Bell Super 3R helmet. It's a half shell but has a chin bar that you can attach and detached. Means when your confidents goes up you can remove the chin bar.
Hope his ankles alright but him hitting that tree was fantastic 😂
I feel you pain. Always did my feet and ankles. In the end I just permanently rode with 661 ankle braces on. Made a big difference in pain management and feeling confident. You're totally killing it on the MTB by the way 👍
As an MTBer who did some homework, I recommend Osprey back/hydration packs, camelback is the big name but osprey are better thought out, Chain Reaction are a good start point, another top tip, join British Cycling for £20 2nd get 10% discount at CRC, have saved myself a fortune
Shimano do a great hydration pack and alterations or funkier clothing is good
any fox mtb clothing are the best, for winter I've just bought the fox downhill polar pants and a gore-tex waterproof jacket......best mtb gear purchases i have made! For a full face i suggest the POC Coron...rated for multiple impacts so you can crash it a lot and you'll survive
10:48 i lost my shit holy fuck that was funny xD
bro you should make your own cry down hill gear shoes the lot job will look sick
The central square hole under the bumper is the main armature part of a tow bar(the expensive bit!), you have the electrics fitted too (black plastic thing to the right of square with sprung lid!). I doubt that you have the plug in part with the hitch under the floor in the boot (it's too big to fit under the floor, old ones used to attach differently and fit under the floor). Go to LR Supermarket in Speke, they can sort you with the bit that's missing (I have the adjustable height removable bar on my RR) - also they sell Thule bike racks - the 'tilting' ones are recommended cos you can still open the boot with bikes on the rack!
Budget is best sometimes man ruin it re buy :)
For your enduro rides you should def get a pair of bib shorts. Basically a Lycra suspender shorts but it has a pad in and stops any chafing. \n\nIt took me years to start wearing them. It it's the best thing I ever did.
giro switchblade is a pretty good helmet for enduro and dh
Osprey hydration packs are really good I’ve had one for a year and it’s really good
Towbars are normally a few hundred quid. Just shop around at scrap metal places and stuff or CES or euro car parts. They will certainly have something for you
An easy way to remember what you need to do is called R.I.C.E.  R- rest I- ice C- compression & E- elevation. If you do that you’ll heal quicker.
Get roof bars fitted by a Land Rover specialist not Land Rover themselves and then get a roof rack for the bikes
You need to get a ute to put your bikes on the back
Why don't you get someone to fabricate one lad
I sprained my ankle really badly and wrapped it up tight to stop it flopping about when on crutches. Turns out it's not the best thing to do according to NHS
And there is a channel on YouTube callGMBN that is all about mountain biking and everything you need to know when you are starting off
Such an expensive vehicle I would go the dealer to get the tow Barr
OMG THAT FIRST VIDEO JOSH PLAYED THO 😂😭😂
I cried of laughter at 9:04
Omg like this if u love grants laugh 😂👏🏼
i cannot believe that was 3 years ago
I would love someone to do this to me that looks so fun😂
Why are your pranks so good???
Your really good at pranking people joe so are you casper but joe is a bit better at pranking people
3:40 - I’m literally dying right now. ( for those who haven’t seen it, as maui says, ‘you’re welcome’ )
Next time u should put the card in ur pocket and make him pop all the balloons
'I'll put a link to the SuggLife website in the description'\nGood One Joe😂
omg the end was so fk sad
HAHA when he's on the phone and a strangled scream cuts through
hi Joe i love you so much your great never stop being a youtuber xx
Aww♡ I miss this kind of videos.❤
Well.. That's good for the environment... ;(
Joe is so dedicated with his pranks it's amazing
Next time put water in them
I'm kinda here - Grant 2017\nI love this
it really doesn't feel like three years!!
📁Documents - 📁Videos - 📁YouTube - 📁 Thatcher Joe - 📁Bad videos - ⚠️ This folder is empty
You are mean Joe. You should,  have given him a spiky think to burst the balloons with like you did with caspar 🎈
I just watched a ten minute ad for you joe
AFJFSERGJVBBSNCDEFGHIJKLMOHDAEFJGD IM SO EXITEDDDDFDDDDD (ik it says exited i dont know how to spell it)
I probably can't even survive one second near a balloon because I'm constantly afraid that they will pop
This is so funny!!! 👍👍👍
He is back with the pranks😂💫
Poor josh I was crying at the enf
lol, I'm an Irish dancer and that vid was so funny
Hey joe if this coment gets 100 likes\nYou'll haft to make some slime
Who else thought the Titanic edit was just amazing!
Awwwwww Josh looked so sad at the end. 😭
You need to fill someone's bathroom with orbeez ❤️❤️❤️
i really would love to know caspars reaction to this. like he comes home, ready to relax, knowing joe hasnt (probably) played a prank on him bc no one has asked him where are you or what time youll be home. so he opens the door and sees the ballons everywhere. he just stands there, in mind going yep joe was here.
THIS WAS UPLOADED ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!
I think Joe, Caspar and Josh should try ballet for a day.
The last part :( I hate you Joe for not helping Josh
This was a really good prank
Grant is hot
HAHAHAHAAHHAHAA
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PRANK GOD YES I LOVE THIS
penny wise is SHOOK
grant's laugh/scream is everything
We need to get joe to do another DARE SUGG
Use water balloons. Harder to clean up
this is your fault, your fault, and partially your fault LMAO he was considerate
this is like the funniest prank ever i sWEAR
Use a fork\nI'm trained
if josh stabbed Joe this would be a great upload
That screaming laughter 😂
Josh: I thought Joe and Josh would come back and help me with the balloons but no. They use to do it for Caspar but I guess not for me.\n(Probably not the correct wording but omg that is soooo sad, poor Josh)\n😂😂😂
I missed these videos so freaking much
poor josh! loved the prank
Ai looveee it
You look like PewDiePie

This was the funniest video I've watched  of yours 😂😂😂
LOVED THIS PRANK, by far my favorite among all the prank videos you have done <3
You  NEED to create a prank war with josh some one tweet this to joe so he sees it
Tbh it would take me the whole two hours to just tie one of the balloons
i can't watch these without laughing lmaooo
It kinda makes me hate josh when he always do that annoyed face on camera coz i've never seen caspar, oli and the other gang gettin annoyed by joe's pranks.... he's just like there glaring, and the way he mimick grant when grant's explaining he's not part of it was kinda...annoyin
Should of filled some with water
Joe Sugg you still need to make part 2 of Caspar and you reacting to your pranks😂😂
What josh shouldve done cuz there was some left PUT IT IN CASPARS ROOM 😂😂

Aaayyyu
Your EPIC thx
Mike Diva is a genius.
Not the superhero we deserve but the one we needed
California is going to become the meme and anime state soon
This is my favorite one haha poor Anna cleaning at the end
So disapointed. Was in the metro with a bicycle, waiting for Super Kind Girl to appear. She never came. 😭😭😭😭
LA is so extra I love it.
Oh, Mike and Anna. Never change.
Is this PC Music?
Anna is so cute omg
Now do one for those a-holes who stand right outside the train doors and try to get on without letting people off. Basic elevator/subway etiquette, people! heh
These ads are creative af. Most unexpected and wonderfully executed! 10/10
I love Mike diva stuff
this is a superhero we need
Mike Diva making the world a better place by bringing artistic integrity to ice cream ads and PSAs
Wooow Excellent job Metro!\nfinally a message that encourages respect for passengers and defends them from other rude passengers. There is no courtesy or kindness in many people in the public transportation system, and it is not an exaggeration but, yes, they behave like monsters.
I LOVED THIS. Mike & Anna are awesome.
I wish we could have that in France !! Ahah I love it !
日本関係ねぇじゃんwww
Does that mean this is the end of metro manners??
God who the fuck is negind this!? It's brilliant.
I just love this.
Is this Hannah Diamond in disguise
Super Kind needs to wait until everyone is off the train before barging in.
train and bus in Japan, also, SuperKind is needed.
Dude wha's this for?  Anyway I love this super crazy n cool KAWAII ;)
More California/Japan fusion! SuperKind is the best. More please! And T-Shirts!
I love Superkind videos, make more! ...and do Full, long songs of already created. Pls ;)
I want the beam she can use.
And we continue to stigmatize bicyclists. Super kind should have used her words and found out why the eyeball monster wasn't standing clear of the aisle. Even eyeball monsters like to go with the flow, unfortunately sometimes there are situations that interfere. This PSA is a misguided social pressure call to action, how about stigmatizing the people that stand where the bikes are supposed to go?
this is a milestone for modern culture
So much better than most music videos!
めちゃめちゃイケてる！
Wow. I love it. \nBut 通路除外 doesn't mean blocking. I think it's 通路妨害. And not ブロキング, ブロッキング is correct.
普通にかわいい曲で好きだわ
I would totally buy a pre-transformation Super Kind t-shirt.
Nice
Where can I buy my Super Kind shirts and other merchandise? This is brilliant.
LOL this got to russian news headliners
The next clip in Moscow
que dice la supa kain cuando mira al rude dude ?? jaja no cacho unaxDD
I don't think you understand the people you're trying to target with these ads.
Lol
Aesthetics
heheheheheh))))
Bahahaha ❤️ this
k...
Convinced me.
Omfg that end!!!
ANNA IS QUEEN!!!
My new favorite anime !
well actually 除害 is correct not 除外..
Never in Russia
Why is it in Japanese?
Why it is in Japanese?
Only a nobody walks in L.A. public transportation is a mobile apt. For the schizo-homeless
I do think its weird that you have Spanish announcements in the US. Doesn't it make sense that people speak a country's first language when they want to live there?
wtf, i'm japanese, so i can't understand what happen in this commercial video XD\nbut this dim metro and pop girl contrast is actually too fun!!\n日本のイメージってこんなんなの・・・・\nまぁ良いか、テンタメの都ロサンゼルスだし。\n俺がグリフィス天文台からホテルの帰りにこの地下鉄乗ったときは、黒人の兄ちゃんが箱にお菓子入れて売り歩いてたなぁ\n駅も車内も薄暗くて、人もまばらだから余計このポップなCMが浮いてるというか・・・ｗ
I wanna do her
超親切のダサさは異常
え、何で日本語なの？\n皆分かるの？
日本..
No surprise it's a man because women are never rude and inconsiderate.
I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
Reaction videos may be fake most of the time, but at least they can be entertaining to watch.
Space band-aid (Not future band-aid, n00bs. This is a long time ago.). Not gross. Love the rest of the video and the commentary on dumb reaction videos.
The hell were you doing to that Porg? Masturbating its eyes?
you don't get a prosthetic face... that doesn't make any sense Watch GITS....   that being said, the black patch could just be something like a futuristic plaster or something... from the lightsaber fight with Rae
What's your favorite Star Wars fllm?
Her nerdiness is ridiculously attractive.
Sitting here hoping Jenny is going to go Full Paige (Netflix 'Atypical' for those who missed the reference) on the Porg toy!!!!
I jerked off my R5 to the new trailer.
Was new ground broked?
Lol this review is so sarcastic and passive aggressive, and taking shots at literally everyone, but then again your like calm and nice. So I am really confused
I don't think it's actually mesh under his skin. I think he's just wearing a cool techno bandage. You know, he just has a particular taste in bandages that he thinks is cool.
I avoided watching this trailer after Johnson's and Hamill's warning. Watching this reaction video somehow feels like a decent compromise between abstaining and watching it. I'm looking forward to seeing Kylo's face mesh in the theater.
The Porg seems to be permanently unhappy. : (
Wow, a real reaction thats not an overreaction, thank you for this Jenny. :)
Oh god all the uncreative RLM comments have migrated....
Those porg eyes are NOT going to last long, Jenny.
This is the best.
Funniest reaction video i've seen. Really apathetic and ironic whilst also being a giant piss take of all the reaction vids about. Love it 😂
I love all your content, and I think you're awesome! But I'm really writing to tell you know that I think your horse is The true embodiment of Black Beauty from the movie. 😁
I agree with you that trailer reactions are silly , but I mostly think they're stupid
Palpatine was set to wear Golden clothing on the previous movies , dont mock snoke.  didnt you join the SW showmoedown
Oh baby, I'd love you  so much, and post-coital would be a trip to the stars! Plus. I'd like to nibbke your feet
After spending over a decade living on a desert planet, Rey has to jump into an ocean and swim so she does. She out-swims all of the local sea creatures but on her SECOND attempt, NOT her first because #NotAMarySue
I think it's some sort of bandage. The scar is different later.
Every time Jenny rolls up her sleeves, take a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so it only happens a few times. Drinking is bad umkay.
In a bold move to finally tie animated Star Wars to live Star Wars, Disney will make Rey the lovechild of Ezra and Sabine.
Many it's like a weird looking Band-Aid.
It’s like Ellie’s new tattoo. The ultimate cosplayers got it tattooed lol
I figured it was a cyber-bandage thing of some sort
I found I had more of a reaction when I tae a shit then I did when I watched trailer. The 1 thing that the trailer are my movement was alt of urrr, ugh, groan and grrrr's
The Mesh Thing as you call it, is most likely a Bacta (Star Wars Magic Medicine) patch used for healing wounds on the go, since this movie is supposed to take place right after the last one according to the director. I'm guessing he is feeling like a failure after his loss to Rey and wants to get right back out there in the fight and slaps it on his face instead of going home to lick his wounds for a while. Then by the end of the film, it will come off. Think future face grow back bandaid.
You're trying to say figuratively blind. Watching Archer helps.
You and rich evans have two different opinions on how to use a porg doll.
This is hardly a reaction video
Is that your daughter's room or do you still live like a 12 year old?
Last shot of Kylo, could be from the flashback at Jedi academ wood-shop failure. And Kylo stoic? I don't know your humor, was that sarcasm or confusion, cuz everyone calls him emo Kylo. :)
the mesh is a space bandage.
How can she hate Rogue One and be excited for TLJ?
I think it's just a space band-aid on his face
How funny, you are silly, and cute, but a little silly, I think I mentioned that already, not sure I trust those porgs though, what someone else called an egguin, a term I like, but I can't wait to see the movie, mesh scars and all, force be with you.
Jenny, is your left sleeve okay?
I thought it was a space band-aid
i do not do reaction
I want to see a Jenny Nicholson/Red Letter Media cross over.  I think their senses of humor would compliment each other nicely.
Biased against the poor Foxes because you don't personally like them?... SMH ;)
Your reaction was cool, seriously. But Tyrone Magnus was better ijs
That stuff is not under Kylos skin I don’t think. It looks likes a band aid almost
Make a video about  Andy Signore.
It baffles my mind people watch this...
who cares if he has a gold robe? What's the big deal? What's to dislike? It may be part of his character development. Who cares. The nitpicking about every little thing is getting to the point that I just can't watch this type of crap anymore. There's NOTHING of value in these videos. Just people doing absolutely nothing, saying absolutely nothing, talking shit about things they'll never come close to accomplishing themselves and so what the fuck is the point? You watched a trailer that we also watched, wow, guess we need a video about it? What's going on in the world? Why are we all choosing entertainment that's duller, less interesting, has less substance and doesn't bring anything new to anything. That's our world today. Watching people watch other videos and then bitch about them. WTF!?
I was a huge fan of the part when the Porg opened up his mask only to reveal another Porg saying, Now, I am The Last Jedi.
I assumed it was a bacti strip to accelerate healing and minimize scarring. If that's the case, then he's obviously wearing it at the beginning of the movie, which is when I think the space battles take place.
If Luke and Anakin can get robot hands that look like normal hands why can't kylo ren get his scar repaired or pull a handsome Jack and have a hologram over it
She is so weird and awkward...yet I still want to bang her.
I HAVE SCREWS IN MY LEG, TOO!!
Yippee, another star wars movie. I can't wait to be disappointed by another average movie hyped to infinity.
Are you underage, why all the fluffy toys?
I can't find last week's millennial falcon. when are you gonna release it Jenny?
The scar looks like some Kevlar tape bought from Amazon stuck on his face.
Torn between avoiding the trailer and watching this video.\n\n*Finally breaks down and watches this video*
Finally. An honest trailer reaction. I'm glad you didn't cry when you heard Luke speag. Or scream like a porg at the end shot. Or surmise the entire plot from a 2 minute clip of film that might not be in the film.
Your mother has a screw in her leg?  She is more machine now, than mother. Twisted and evil.
I would be very interested to see your analysis of the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who, if that's something you are familiar with. Although it may be too much of a complete mess to even attempt analyzing...
It's not fun watching someone complain about entertainment
PLEASE MAKE OUT WITH THE PORG ON YOUR NEXT VIDEO!
The whole flick is a comedy!
Max Landis brought me here ❤️
LOL
Great video.
That Kylo ren  doll is creepy af
Eff the redemption arc. Kylo gots to die.
Watched 10x before lighting up.
What eats porgs?
*gasp
Reaction starts at Never:Clickbait
LOL
No. The last shot is a flashback. And that fire behind him matches up with the scene where Luke is digging himself out of the rubble.
the metal mesh represents a small step towards kylo's machine. \nhe's more machine now than man.
That was surprisingly fun. I kinda enjoy reaction videos (although I always keep in mind that this trend is a tad depressing, sociologically speaking), but yours was one of the rare believable ones I've seen... ^^; Some people are good at it, whatever it is, and some aren't, some have lives, some are men-children with the emotions of five year-old girls. In any case, I like your humor.
If Vader was Jenny's dad he'd try to force choke me to death every time he reads my mind because of my impure thoughts towards his daughter..
It kinda doesn't work to criticize trailer reactions while running with a Droopy-the-dog schtick as pretentious as this. Just putting that out there.
Our allegedly strong female lead with the line Just show me my place in all this worries me.  A strong character has goals and at least an idea of the path they want to take.  Rey kinda just bumbled her way through The Force Awakens too.
Is she for real?
No, I definitely do not need this.... sorry. But your command of the obvious is really firm.
Mr Sunday Movies does this better.
God I can’t stand this girl
Trailer reactions are silly, you are so right. Most of them should be called trailer overreactions.
God I hate you
Other people are having fun in ways I disapprove of. You should only have fun in the same way I do.
If you really want to see cringe reactions in their purest form, type ComicBookCast2 trailer reactions. The guy who does those reactions is like Tommy Wiseau of trailer reactions.
You are so perfect, and I would, still, say that if I could only hear you on the radio,...... or something stupid like that.
I love the Porgs too
Her attractiveness is approaching 5000.
I clapped when I looked at the comment section and everyone said they clapped, because I know that reference too!
I'm so sorry to admit this, but I fap to Jenny all the time.
Also quit Shitting on trailer reactions. People like the crew at Blind Wave, for instance,  work very hard on their content, know their stuff, are intelligent, and their responses show this. People want to see fans like THEM react to things they are equally fans of, as well as hear their subsequent opinons on the matter. Your invalidation of this is very narrow.
The only The Last Jedi Trailer Reaction you need.. *to avoid*
You think I look funny? HARD TO TAKE SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHAT!!!!!!!! although I have to thank you for calling me fashion forward I do like my Gold Robe but I'm supremely intimidating I'm not funny other than that this amused me
I love you.
Oh my god, the hammer pulled you off? xD
For all the people saying the voice doesn't fit the character, thats the point dipshits, its a joke.
Korgs voice is great expectation subversion. you'd expect him to have a deep low voice, but he doesn't. and he's quite eloquent too.
korg is my favorite now. god bless this weird rock man.
Take notes, Fox! Kevin Feige/his crew can make a better *Thing* than your 4 failed attempt/boring/corny ass movies! LOL!
Y’all complaining bout the voice doesn’t fit the character but not appreciating the pure brilliance of a gay sex joke in a Marvel 🎥.
The voice is unique and I love it. Kinda reminds me of Alpha from UP. You’d expect a badass voice from a badass character but you’re instantly surprised by how it really sounds
XD Krog looks like Winston Peters with Taika Waititi's voice.
ragnarok they said , movie gonna be dark they said ...oh well i just hope it wont flop
Knew the director would screw the movie. Just like Bay and Transformers. Korg better have some good fighting skills to compensate 4 that inaccurate voice the director so stupidly gave him.
Either I’ve grown up or marvel has gotten so corny my fucking god what did they do to korg?!?!?! He can’t seem to pull enough quips fast enough apparently and you can hardly understand what he was saying.
You guys do realize that this is not The Thing but in fact Korg, right?
Beached bro
Really that's his voice? Why would they even do that?
Where can i find this Stand up comedy?
Stupid accent for Korg, doesn't even match up with the animation and the accent in general sucks, couldn't even tell at first what he was saying. How the hell does the hammer rode you on your back become damma rude you on yus beck? \n\nStupiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
IT'S CLUMBERING TIME!
Yes! I knew the thing was in this!
I don't think they filled the quota of 5 jokes per minute yet. Quick get him another quip.
I'd be fine with the voice if it sounded like he was trying but it's clear someone really didn't give a fuck about Korg
Not enough quips
Why the fuck have Marvel allowed Taika to make Thor into a parody of himself? This looks horrible.
This scene is not funny. Fuck i think blade runner had funnier scenes than this.
That sounds nothing like Korg
I have PCOS and I still struggle with body image because of the side effects of it so I really appreciated seeing Leena's attitude and it was really inspiring and I don't know it just made me feel better so <3.
I was diagnosed with PCOS pretty young as well. I didn't have periods really much, I would go like 5 months without one then have a tiny one that lasted about a day. Me being the anxious person I am asked my mom who also has PCOS and she told me her mom also has PCOS so I went to the doctors. It wasn't until college that I started the pill however, after bleeding for about a month straight, very heavily they put me on the pill. It has worked wonders for my skin and for regulating my periods. I also no longer have to live with constant morning sickness when I wake up now. It has also helped a lot with my mental health as well, while I still struggle with my weight it is nice seeing the changes my body and mind have gone through by simply regulating my hormones. I would highly recommend the pill for anyone with PCOS, it might help a lot.
This video has made me realise how uneducated I am about my PCOS. I was diagnosed 2 years ago and given a pill to take. When I found out it was just this explains everything and then carried on. I don’t know if this is just something I’ve just experienced, but I never really knew anyone else who had it so it wasn’t something I really talked about.
I watched this video a week ago just to learn new stuff, but today I was diagnosed with a mild form of PCOS (so far the only simptoms are acne and a 2 cm cyst on my ovary). So belated thanks for the video, I'll be watching it again ;)
Right, I just thought this was cute: My four-year-old daughter watched the tail end of this and said that you two have the same voice. It took me a bit, but then I realized she meant your accents. Love this series Hannah! Thanks for the awesome info and coverage.
Hannah's bf must be having his dreams fulfilled
I don't want to be that annoying person who gives unsolicited advice.. But you could read 'Woman Code' by Alisa Vitty, she diagnosed and healed her PCOS maybe that is usefull for you! ☺️
i was diagnosed about 4 years ago and my doctor explained it to me like the NHS explains it, and she did add a bit of history saying that some years ago doctors did though they were actual classical cysts. so thats probably why lena was so confused at the beggining. xx
Human DNA has been evolving to out a strand of genetics that has been dominant in history that is the underwritten Alzheimer's gene and people under 25 have evolved just enough through Selective Breeding to remain free of the Alzheimer's gene or DNA strand, people over 24 report losing memories at age 27 and then they begin committing crimes as well as making headway in developing criminal syndicates that work with the government and they start families and become heterosexuals
I'm currently being tested for PCOS. I'm 27 and it's taken 10 years to get to this stage, my extremely irregular and very painful periods were always blamed on being overweight. I had a scan and apparently don't have anything on/in my ovaries leading my GP to tell me I don't have it. However another GP at my practice told me  I have all the other symptoms and the cysts are just one symptom. I finally have an appointment at the hospital with a specialist in November. Doctors drag things out and Ness you around so much. If you're even a little overweight that's all the doctors see at first, I've suffered for over a decade because the doctors didn't test me for anything. In fact this time I was told that apparently I had a blood test 10 years ago and the results were iffy but I was never told, it was never followed up and nothing happened about it. I'm just glad I've finally got some answers and can attempt to move forward with things.
I was told by an insensitive doctor when I was about 15 that I may have PCOS. I was a fairly late bloomer when it came to periods and they soon became irregular up to 6 months or so. I have a lot of dark hair which I assume was just hereditary and I always yo-yo'd with my weight. It was terrifying being told that I couldn't have kids but this doctor said you never know because the likes of Victoria beckenham suffer with it and look at her (the fuck?) I had no idea what it was and felt like my womanhood was taken away from me. I had scans which came back boarder line and now I'm 22 and still have no idea other than I *assume* I'm ok. I'm careful with what I eat (especially with IBS) my periods are regular from taking Yasmin years ago but the growth in facial hair is insane. I epilate / pluck after years of shaving (I know) and it's a constant struggle - my hormone tests showed nothing obvious but I definitely feel something isn't right. Waffling over :(
I also have PCOS and I am not on any contraception. I treat mine with metformin which is also used for diabetes and helps control my blood sugar.
This video is also really relatable, I have IBS, eczema and chronic back pain so I know what it's like to have a weird love-hate relationship with my body. It does amazing things for me but also fails at the most basic functions. It's been a journey.
Both of you ladies look GORGEOUS in this video! ❤️
I'm sure someone will have suggested this already but have you thought about doing something similar for endometriosis? The comments show how many people this video has helped and I know how much it would have meant to me as a teenager to have something like this for my condition. Anything to raise awareness of endo helps as many of the symptoms are dismissed as just bad periods and it can only by diagnosed via laparoscopy. As a result of this, diagnosis takes on average 7 years and is a long and emotional process that no one should have to do on their own.
i have pcos, but i am not overweight or anything and i didn't feel any like 'bad symptoms' so far. But i went to the doctor lately and he basically told me: Your overies look bad, not sure you will be able to get pregnant, you have PCOS. Badabum. i was like: wow, wtf, thanks for your sensitivity... :(
was always playing the mum in theatre because I was chubbier - omg same
Oh my God I was 18 when I was diagnosed. Leena's story hit so close to home I wanted to cry a little. I'm so glad we aren't alone. Love it when the doctor's say just lose weight. Like we don't try. \n\nAlso totally had that moment with the childbearing. I had always assumed I would have kids my entire life; then at 18 when I was told by my doctor that I probably wouldn't be able to have kids, I had a 5-6 year span where I told myself I didn't want kids (I think because I assumed I couldn't have them). Now, only in the last year or so, have I started wanting kids again, I think because I'm in a relationship where I feel loved and supported no matter whether we have kids or not. It's very weird.
I have PCOS but was never told I had cysts. Just have irregular periods, high male hormones, extra body and facial hair etc., I don't get a lot of weight gain as I have an eating disorder but that also contributes to irregular periods and body hair! No doctors can give me a definite answer which is annoying so I don't really know what's happening
I had the irregular periods, painful, bad acne and weight gain but the mood swings/ bad depression was worst part for me. Pill helps but also causes symptoms of anxiety and depression?!
perfect timing for this video, just found out I might have PCOS
The NHS basically only recognises the diagnosis of PCOS as a woman who has excess hair growth, high testosterone, is overweight etc. HOWEVER- PCOS can also be associated with other hormonal issues that basically just aren't recognised by the NHS. A relative of mine has been diagnosed with PCOS and I haven't yet but experience many of the same symptoms as she did before treatment. Neither my relative nor I experience any of the traditional PCOS symptoms: we are both slim, little body hair etc. with low oestrogen but not high testosterone. The low oestrogen wreaks havoc on my urinary tract because it changes the PH balance of the area causing it to be more alkali and less acidic (should be slightly acidic) as well as a myriad of other contributing problems such as less natural good bacteria etc. This causes me to get UTIs very frequently with no cause and other bladder related pain and issues. This can be extremely painful day to day and incredibly debilitating. My relative was the same and also had other symptoms, however in order to be diagnosed she had to see a private doctor, since no nhs doctor would test her or take her seriously. They even told her it was all in her head and she was just making it up, and I've had similar experiences with nhs doctors. They simply don't recognise other forms of hormonal problems in women and its really awful and upsetting when you are essentially living with chronic pain, to not be taken seriously by doctors whose job it is to help you with your health. When my relative was tested- lo and behold, clear markers of hormonal problems, but NHS doctors hadn't even bothered to look. Luckily with support from family she could afford to pay for a private doctor or else she may have had to live with pain and may not have even been able to have children. I believe this lack of understanding of the female hormonal system is largely due to sexism in the NHS and just a lack of care and concern for women's health. It is truly despicable the amount of pain the numerous NHS doctors have caused my relative, and my own experience tells me this is not merely a few rogue doctors- It is simply policy to ignore women in pain.
I remember before i got diagnosed with PCOS and i had to have an ultrasound on my ovaries but there was never anything on them and i went a few times , so once i finally had my glucose checked did i find out i have it
I think this was super informative and really interesting. I have CFS (google it) and because its so untreatable and unknown, every single time i learn about some new illness/disease, im like oh i could have that!! It would explain this and this and this! I switch into hypochondriac mode, but only because im always desperately searching for an explanation as to WHY im like this :/
this video is awesome! i have pcos and went through so many of the same experiences (diagnosed at 15, put on the pill, attempts to remove hair and lose weight and such) and it's great that you are talking so openly about just accepting your body the way it is. <3
Having PCOS,  for me it's about not letting it define me. In the back of my head I know weightloss can be harder, but I persist anyway. The youtuber Sarahs Day is a good inspiration for me because she's fit, healthy and happy and doesn't let her hormones rule her, and shows how she balances her body out.\n\nMine developed later in life and I just saw it as life steering me in a healthy direction. So I told myself I couldn't be like all the young people surrounding me - to stop with regular drinking and careless eating. Now I stick to yoga and whole foods. It's probably saved me from more serious things in the future that develop due to poor lifestyle choices.
Thank you for this! I was diagnosed with pcos a few months ago at the age of 25. I was completely terrified and relieved at the same time. I went undiagnosed for almost 10 years in those 10 years I would only get my period if I was on birth control. If I was not on the pills I would just not get a period. I knew absolutely nothing about pcos a few months ago. Seeing this now makes me more secure about having pcos and hearing more stories is amazing!
I have PCOS. Got diagnosed this year (I'm 25) and now I just got a letter in the mail about how I should get a flu shot because I'm in some risk group and Im like what risk group... the diabetes one or? I guess the diabetes one. \nAnyways. I got diagnosed because once I got off the pill (because I forgot to take it and was just waiting for my period to start again) that I was only on because of my hairy problems.. and then I didn't get my period for 2 years. Went to the doctor after 3 or 6 months or whatever and she was like come back in x months. So I came back and they were like you might have pcos let's test it. And I read about it and I was like oh I for sure have that I have all the symptoms. But I didn't get proper diagnosed till this year because my gynacologist and doctor couldn't agree on how to test me at the time but then this year I went back and they were like oh no we don't need that you already meet the criteria just because you have the hair and the acne and the irregular periods. I'm like great well they could've told me that 3 years ago. But I think the criteria changed as well. Anyways. I'm trying this dairy-free, gluten-free, soy -free, low glycemic load diet but it is hard because I hate cooking and i'm in Hungary and I don't speak the language so how am I going to find all the things I need or how do I know if I can even have something lol. I tried laser for the hair on my face, it didn't work, only made it worse. Mentally it sucks because I just feel worthless like not only am I overweight, I also have too much hair everywhere and the acne doesn't help either. Kids I am not too concerned about I don't really want them.
(Not PCOS, but other medical complications)\nUgh yes when doctors are like WHEN you decide you want to get pregnant... , like I have told you ten times I don't, if I decide otherwise I will tell you.
Im very very happy to see this video! I too have PCOS. Was diagnosed as pre diabetic at 13 but wasnt diagnosed with PCOS until 22. Tall about a struggle!
Maybe do a video on Endometriosis as well? Because it's so common and affects a lot of people. It's also a reason a lot of women are on the pill. I don't even have a diagnosis but my symptoms were really strong, so, as Leena, I was put on the pill long before being sexually active. I think it's important to talk about these kind of issues cause as you said in one of your previous videos, there's some kind of movement against hormones, but people forget hormones do a lot of other stuff on top of the birth control part. And I feel it's quite disturbing when people just assume I'm some kind of sex addict or whatever when they find out I'm on the pill, even if it's just medicine for me.
I had a lot of the symptoms of PCOS but the ultrasound only showed a small sac on one of my ovaries so they came to the conclusion that i dont have it, finding that out was hard because i thought i had finally found an explanation for my symptoms when i hadnt
I really like this series. I have learnt a lot of things from this I didn't know in depth about. Especially today's episode has made me think to go and be checked myself as I have had a few symptoms of this. Xx
ye i have some of these symptoms but idk if i should go get checked or not?
I have it and live in and the US, I lost both of my ovaries to tumors and that's how I found out I even had it! Fun fact losing ovaries does not end the condition. Loved this video I have had such a hard time finding real information that wasn't geared towards women who are worried about getting pregnant which when I search for info all I get is fertility information which makes me feel doubly awful because I obv can't get pregnant so I do not care and it makes me feel like my only function in life was to be a baby factory. It's just so frustrating sorry to vent!
I love love that PCOS is being talked about more, like so many people I was diagnosed when I was 15 when nobody really knew much about it and talking about it was taboo but videos like this mean we can all learn more about our bodies and feel ok talking about this shitty syndrome ❤️
Thank you so much for this!!! Such a lovely surprise in my subscription feed xx Love both your videos!
I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I'm now 23). I was put on the pill (Dianette) too.  I have excess hair and weight gain but didn't know about the other things (insulin etc). Good old NHS choices. This video was reassuring! Thanks for talking it.
People still listen to Good Charlotte?
Did they give you something like glucophage when you were first diagnosed?
I have PCOS and I was nodding my head all through out while Hannah's reading the symptoms and description of PCOS 😂 I was like yup.. ahuh.. true, true.. 😂😂😂
I feel so deeply for little Lena and her male doctor experience. I also have PCOS that was diagnosed at 15 and I had a TERRIBLE male doctor that told me I was fat and if I didn't lose weight to where he thought I should be that he would fire me as a patient. This is the same male doctor that told me (at a later date) that I would just never be able to have kids. I eventually switched to a new doctor that was completely horrified by his behavior.
I relate so much to not knowing that much about your illness! I have Crohns and I'm only slowly learning what it is and getting better at answering people when they wonder what it is. It's weird when people ask you about your illness and you can't really answer, but I'm not interested enough to go read about it haha..
Thank you so much for doing this video!! I have PCOS, and I'm also resistant to insulin, but I had no idea they were connected! I just thought I had made some really bad nutritional decisions as a kid and didn't remember or something. But hey I suppose it's always good to check up on what you thought you knew every now and again lol.\nAnd yeah the symptoms are shit. It would usually mean I missed a few days of school every couple months or so when periods DID happen. Now I have a hormonal IUD (Mirena) and it's actually been helpful so far? The pill I took in high school was shit, so I'm really surprised this is working out so well!\nAlso of I remember correctly, I think depression and vitamin D shortage are also correlated with PCOS? It's ridiculous how much of the body is interconnected.
Oh, just for the confusion, the 'cysts' are actually vacuums. Basically, the egg is produced within the ovary, but people with PCOS don't release a hormone that allows it to follow through to the fallopian tube, so it becomes a vacuum instead. These vacuums can build up and replace important tissue, making people with PCOS infertile, so that's why it's so important to see what your options are!
I haven’t been diagnosed with PCOS but I was put on the pill to get rid of ovarian cysts. I also had really bad pain while on my period and it was very irregular. The pill actually helped a lot with both 👍
Hannah, it would be lovely if one of these videos was about retroverted uterus. I have it - It shouldn't be a problem in having babies or anything like that. It's just your uterus being in a different position than it should be. It caused me a lot of pain - during sex, during using tampons. It's because these things are touching my uterus. Now, I'm trying to use the menstrual cup. It doesn't cause any pain, but i've tried several different cups and they still keep leaking, even after a year I've been using them. They told me it's got a thing to do with me being a different shape down there. \n\nI didn't know about it for quite a time when i was younger and i kept wondering why certain positions hurt sooo much.\nIt would be lovely, if there are more young ladies, who maybe haven't been to gynecologist yet, to know about this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I was diagnosed with PCOS 4 years ago and struggle to find people talking about it. \nI'd like to share that I feel like my doctor told me nothing, most of what I know is from my own research which is very annoying when you find conflicting information online. \nIt's not something that really effects me, I have all the symptoms but I've learnt to live with them. However, when trying to lose weight is when I notice it most. People around me seem to drop 2kg in a week where as it will take me a whole month to lose that much, its so disheartening and my mental health suffered because of this. I saying this so others don't feel alone and also if anyone has any tips please please please hit me up! ❤️
Thank you for making this video! I was diagnosed last year at 20 years old. I didn't get my period until I was nearly 17 and they've always been very irregular, but I was missing other common symptoms like insulin resistance, high androgen levels, and being overweight, so none of my doctors checked until I was 20. They did change the definition of PCOS recently (not sure how recently), so now you only have to meet 3 'criteria' to be diagnosed (acne, irregular periods, and ovarian cysts were mine).
I always thought the fluid filled bags were what cysts are 😌
I have PCOS. It took me years to find out what was wrong and even after that managing it has not been fun, especially as all doctors see is my weight. When I was 15/16, I went to a doctor complaining of stomach pain (most likely my uterus but I was still learning about my body) and irregular periods that were heavy and leave me unable to function. Doctor looked at me, pointed out my weight gain near my middle, acknowledged my irregular periods, commented on my excessive hair and noted my high insulin levels. All of these are key symptoms of PCOS. Instead he told me to loose weight and gave me some samples for my stomach pain. So I left there, changed my diet and still a year later nothing had changed. I gave up. Till I turned 21, when I complained about the same thing and was finally diagnosed. Problem is I went on the pill and my reaction was really bad bleeding and resulted in anaemia and A hospital visit. 4 years since then and I haven't got it sorted or anything. I've also added the lovely issues of depression and anxiety, two common mental health conditions that PCOS women are more inclined to have. So I've had PCOS playing with me for a decade now (possibly even when I was 12, but that may just be growing up fun) and it's still changing and challenging me. \n\nDespite all this I'm learning, and with each year I learn more about this condition and how I can cope with it. So to any one suffering from PCOS or any symptoms that they feel is real and more then just a weight or age thing, seek out alternative advice if you can, until YOU feel better about yourself and are satisfied. And be willing to learn along the way. Good luck~!
Thank you for making this video. After being given conflicting messages following my diagnosis it is hard to know how to manage it. Especially when you’re told just to lose weight when its easier said than done.
Where did u get your shirt from ?
OK. wow. Leena is so right? I have a primary ovial insuffience (no idea if thats the name, im german so thats the literal translation) and been diagnosed when I was 15, because I hadnt gotten my period then. And untill today (age 20) i have never even googled it because fuck im afraid. It means I dont get my period naturally (Im on the pill now, so now I do) and I 95% wont be getting pregnant ever. And that shit is scary. But what I want to say: thanks for making this. Just having someone talk openly about conditions /illneses that are just in the slightes way like mine makes not feeling shit so much easier.
This was actually pretty interesting. Thank you for putting in effort to educate us viewers. Especially young viewers like myself (14 yrs,) it’s super important.
My nan had PCOS and so even though I dont have any symptoms I always worry I won't be able to have kids as I've always wanted to. Probably no need to worry though but yeah
So relatable... I don't have PCOS but I had ovarian cancer at an usually young age (14)... With only one ovary left I've battled huge hormanal changes, lots of different pills and lots of (male) doctors giving me their own opinions on what I should do with my body. Frustratingly, my doctor refused to put me on a pill after my operation, as he thought 14/15 was too young to be on it so I essentially had period for about 2 years straight with IMMENSE PAIN. After lots of trials on finding a pill that actually regulated me I was put on Diane35 - which is the same as Dianette I think - which as far as I know is used for acne, but is banned in some countries, causes blood clots and has a huge link to depression. And I've been on that for years. Yet no matter what, doctors can't really tell me what the effect of any of this has? I've been told that my 'time limit' for babies is shorter so I better be a mum quicker (ew), yet no one has answers for the long term effect of a heavy pill, or why my period was irregular after my operation, or why I suddenly had immense period pain (that still continues with the pill, and hurts despite taking opiates?). PERIODS ARE FRUSTRATING ): \nBut this series is great, thank you Hannah for continuing to care about women's bodies and inform the world xx
I have been diagnosed when I was 13 and had multiple doctors since then. I have always had a problem with my weight even though I was in semi professional dancing group and at the same time in aerobic team at my uni. I want to share two thoughts that might help smb:\n1. It's common to have too much insulin as it is not efficient and this excess it the reason for extra weight. As insulin makes you put on weight, you produce even more of it. Last year I started taking Glucophage and it helps a lot. I lost nearly 10% of my body mass, by just taking it (no changes in exercise and diet), also I am less hungry, more energised and productive, so totally recommend talking about it with your doctor.\n2. My  other doctor suggested that it is easier to get pregnent after withdrawal of the pill as your period is regulated. I haven't tried jest though, so cannot say from experience :p
I got diagnosed with PCOS just last summer. \nI had come off the pill in october because I wanted to see if that would help my mental health since I'm  person who is very susceptible to depression and such. I then had a very long period for all of november and then it just stopped in december. I didn't have any periods at all and I only thought to tell my mum when it was almost summer again. Coming off the pill was absolutely horrible for me. I felt my mental health destabilize even more, I gained weight despite making an effort to do some exercise, I grew more bodyhair which was also quite dark and thick. \nSo eventually, I went to see a doctor. First one I had basically did the same as told here 'oh you're fat so you need to lose weight and it'll go away'. She didn't explain what was happening very well either. I was just so confused. That was my first time ever seeing a gyno and I'm glad my mum was with me because she pushed for the doctor to give me something to help me along. I'm an overweight person, but not overly so. And my mum knew that, and she knew I was trying to lose weight before but that it wasn't working. So, they gave me an extra heavy pill and I was on that for a few months. Until I went for my follow up exam with another doctor.\nHe seemed a little cross when I explained what happened last time and basically I went in there and he explained properly what was going on in my uterus and such and then said I don't HAVE to be on that heavy pill, I can just take the regular one I was taking when I first started taking the pill. \n\nEver since then, I've been feeling quite alright. My body has gone down in terms of swelling, which was the main thing for me. I couldn't stand it because I knew something wasn't quite alright with that. My mental health is in quite good shape which is making life a lot easier. It's been good since that last visit.\n\nIt does scare me a little tho, that you say you're pre-diabetic. That's something my doctor did not explain to me. My mum has diabetes so I'm already at a higher risk for it. I do get check ups every four years for a research they're doing around diabetes and how it affects offspring. So far, so good. But good to know that's a thing to look out for. She has type 1 so it's a lesser chance I'll get it too just because of genes, but there is still a risk.
As someone who has been diagnosed with PCOS since she was 13 I'm so happy that there is finally a video on it that says how while it is something that we have to live with, and while it does affect our lives, it doesn't really control us and we find our own ways of how to deal with it and still be cool as fuck human beings <3
As an older woman with both Pcos and Endometriosis i enjoyed  this video so much. I also do not want children, ( lucky really) ) The weight is a big issue for for me, even though  i am a size 10/12, i exercise  a lot and eat well. I have been having laser hair removal for the last year, although it does come at a price.... it is sooooo worth it!! I wish i has had it done years. ago.
I have this too!! I was diagnosed when I was twelve but not really officially, it was just suspicion with no follow up. When I was 17 I got checked again because my period is all over the fucking place, early this year.  It's so weird how there's no tablets or anything to help the release of eggs for people not wanting to get pregnant. No method to help me has been suggested so im assuming there is none?\n but that in itself really pisses me off 1)because there seems to be a trend in misinformation or lack of information and 2) because it communicates to me that there aren't any people researching what can help PCOS.\n I have my period with week - two week long gaps and i would like that to not be a thing and have made it clear in the first case that my period was a problem I would to sort out - yet all medical professionals seem to be doing with PCOS people is just remarking o thats funny, sending us to whatever external office to get tested, then just leaving us there to sit with with syndrome. This condition isn't horrible or urgent, but still is effecting me negatively. I mean have 2 events of 6-9 day  periods a month, more money spent of sanitary items and less time to be sexually active (my country isn't as accepting of period sex :( cry) leaving me and others pissed off and helpless. arehg;erwh yluhtgur.
Im really struggling with my pcos atm\nThank you for this
They often prescribe metformin to treat PCOS, which is originally for diabetes. It can help with the weight.
my best friend has PCOS and i love that more people are talking about it on youtube
I have many of the symptoms of PCOS, that is irregular periods, difficulty losing weight, insulin resistance, facial hair around my chin. Because of this I had the ultrasound to see, to which my doctor at the time said I didn't. When I went to a gynecologist for a second opinion he said that doctors are constantly arguing over what the definition of PCOS, and that they can never come to an agreement. For me, I get very frustrated, and sad and embarrassed because I don't have an answer on what is going on with my body. I don't feel like a girly girl and that bothers me and i often feel like I won't ever be able to find a guy who is going to understand this. It would just be nice to have an answer on what is going on with my body.
Needed this. I have it too and it's great to hear others about it. I don't have any symptoms except for having no period, so im kinda lucky.
Uhhhhmmm I'm freaking out a little bit because by watching this video, I'm pretty sure I have pcos... like literally everything she's said I've experienced, besides all of the pill/coil experiences.
I didn't know about PCOS until Lena posted her first video on it. Those symptoms she described were the ones I had! I went to my nurse practitioner and asked her about it. She put me on some form of the pill (don't remember which) in order to get my periods to a regular schedule. I took those for a year and it did not help my brain. I already have anxiety, and the pills pushed my anxiety to unhealthy levels. This last February, I got an IUD (Skyla, low hormones and made for uteruses who have not given birth). Since, my PCOS symptoms are slowing down, my mental health is better, and I've began to lose weight!
Your friend is so lovely and positive. It gives so much hope for her to say that she shaves w her bf and it's fine. Like, all of us hairy women out here being told we're not attractive bc of our facial hair can see that we can be loved. Thank you for this video
Wow! Facintating! Thank you for sharing all this good info on PCOS. I have it but not the symptoms other than shooting pain when ovulating. Wheee!
I was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 2 months ago. I'm still in denial about it, hoping that I can change it with diet, exercise and anything else I can try. I'm seeing a naturopath and after having my bloodwork done, he didn't see anything related to the typical hormones surrounding PCOS as being a cause for it. Instead, he saw that I had low vitamin D and iodine levels, which are things that contribute to hormone production and regulation. I've been taking vit D and seaweed (high in iodine) for the last few months, limiting soy products, and exercising more. I'll be getting my blood done in the next few weeks, anxious to see my new results!
I found out 12 years ago (when I was 16) that I had PCOS and I can definitely relate to Leena's entire experience because mine was so eerily  similar. I was told at 16 WHAT?! YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR PERIOD YET?! SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU!  I was forced to go through many uncomfortable tests (including the ultrasound where I almost peed on myself too) only to have the doctor's say You have this condition. You might not be able to have children. You have extra testosterone so you will be fat, hairy and oh get used to that acne because it's here to stay. You are at risk for several health conditions including diabetes & cancer. You need to accept that now. Oh you want a treatment? have you tried losing weight even though I just told you that it will be almost impossible to do that. Oh and even though you've never even kissed a boy yet, here, start taking these birth control pills maybe they will help your hormones. Sorry Bye. It's a difficult thing to come to terms with as a 16 year old especially in the midst of severe mental health issues I was also dealing with at the time. I've learned to manage my condition (badly at times) over the years but it makes me feel so much better when people try to educate themselves about the condition like you have because it's not just something that takes a toll on your body but on your mind as well and having support around you in the form of family/friends can ease the heavy burden you carry around everyday when you are a PCOS sufferer. <3
I have PCOS. I only found out because I had my period three weeks on one week off for 4 months in a row, then found out I had high levels of testosterone. No cysts though. They gave me birth control and I haven't seen or heard from my period again, which I'm loving.
One of the scariest moments of my life was when my former roommate who has pcos had a large cyst burst. She started feeling the pain about 830p. It took until about 915p to talk her into going to the er. We were there until 5a the next morning. It released something into her system that almost killed her. Always take these issues seriously please!
My mom has PCOS but will never really talk about it. I've learned so much, thank you!
THANK YOU FOR THIS 🙌 I was diagnosed with pcos about 6 years ago and nobody talks about it.
I don't have the Syndrome, but I do have Polycystic Ovaries, so the symptoms aren't as harsh with me. But it's really nice to see someone else's experience! I found out about mine because I had very severe acne and after an incredibly strong treatment that worked wonders, some of it came back way faster than it should've. So I had the same exam Leena had, which is an ultrasound with you on the verge of peeing and my treatment was (is) being on the pill. It did help a lot though because my periods were always sooo irregular and painful (so SO painful) and now I feel almost nothing and know exactly when it's gonna pop up, which is GREAT. So yeah, just thought I'd share my experience as well since someone might have more mild symptoms like I had.
I have PCOS. Thank you for bringing awareness. ❤️
Hannah and Leena, you both make such informative and insightful videos. Thanks for putting this out into the world!
I went off the pill at the start of the year and have followed along with this series ever since. My doctor has suggested I get tested for PCOS as she have some of the symptoms.
Doctors are supposed to give accurate, reliable and current information. \nSo many don't do it though.
Hiya Hannah :), \nIm really loving the hormone diaries i find it interesting that hormones effect everyone in so many different ways!!,  I was wondering if you could make an episode on Turner syndrome i would really love you to make a video on the topic as its pretty rair for people to know of it :), its a condition effecting women in which i have . One symptom is lack of fertility, i have underactive ovaries which means im on HRT to get periods , i may need an egg donar when i decide to have children i dont mind as i will ask my big sister and  where i have a womb i will hopefully be able to carry my baby full term which i think i will be a really cool thing to share with my sister 😊💖🌼, sending  hugs hannah :) http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Turners-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx
Great video for raising awareness xx
I have PCOS and my doctor told me at 16 can't have children. I was half way through my second year at university I found out I was 9 months pregnant and didn't know I was actually pregnant but because of the doctors telling me I couldn't and having blood tests and appointment where no one picked it up, I had no idea. It really affected my mental health from not knowing and being told something by a doctor, so I can't trust them now. PCOS is something that's so difficult to manage. Thank you for sharing this video 💜
This is a great video
I was diagnosed 2 yrs ago and I have always thought it was cysts on my ovaries
when you have a bottle collection with the same bottles.... <3
This was a really good interview. Hannah, I think this is a particular skill of yours - you're great at getting to the heart of the matter, past the surface and asking really insightful questions. Thank you Leena for opening up about it. There should be no shame! xx
as someone with PCOS, it's honestly really great to hear someone with a similar experience talk about it and being able to relate. Thank you for making such an amazing video :)
Everyone has follicles agghhhhh
Is PCOS ever considered an intersex condition?
U are awesome
dis a good comment section. thanks fur geetin' peeps talkin'.
So interesting 💜💜
I thought it was Polycystic *Ovarian* Syndrome.
7:45 aww also Shrek reference <3
Leena, my love!!!
just diagnosed!
You DO get cysts on your ovaries when you have PCOS! The cyst forms when the follicle tries to release the egg and it cant so the follicle swells and turns into a cyst on your ovary where the egg should have been released.
That's strange. Jim never vomits at home.
they used this in the movie cause the lady who was the wife was in a commercial for Yuban coffee and she said that line in the commercial
I will, but Jim won't
Her name is Lee Bryant...   She played the pregnant lady, Punkin in an episode of three's company when Jack and Chrissy agree to take over Janet's babysitting job for one night and had to put up  with a crying baby, no TV, and a locked liquor cabinet  :)
If you are putting polygons together at a vertex, if the polygons are in the same plane, you know you have reached the max. In the case of hexagons, its 3. If you want to form a 3d shape, you need to use fewer, which would be 2, which also doesnt work because then the ball would just be 2 hexagons stacked on top of each other which would be hilarious to watch but nobody would score. I dont know if that's any simpler but thats how I thought about it
Matt Parker: Fighting the good fight.
I find this vídeo funny but is True.
no extra cost?  no such thing.  someone has to draw it up, the image must be then turned into whatever template that is used for the stencilling, lists updated with new image, etc, etc...  it would cost many many thousands to get it done properly.
The skid warning signs annoys me more, the skid tracks cross each other!
While we are at it, that plane doesn't seem to have any engines.
What a Parker Square of a sign. They should update it ASAP.
Wooow great video and amazing editing!!!! I agree on the fact that's kinda an embarrassment for UK since you invented football and you had such a glorious tradition of mathematicians!
I was told recently that the official standard for baseball's home plate is also a mathematically impossible shape. Is there something larger at play here with sports and maths? Conspiracy or not, I bet there's a joke or two in there...Look into it for us Matt.
Oh yeah- that'd be a good use of my road tax money, do that.......
Years from now, no one will remember what a hexagon is. But you win State, and that goes up on the water tower. - Hank Hill \n\nhttp://geocitiessites.com/arlen_texas/leagues.htm
Just checked, The Netherlands do have the correct geometry. Also just wanted to point out that the painted bicycles on the road surfaces are also wildly anatomically incorrect in the UK. Also worthy of a petition.
Matt, you are playing the Reading hexagon tonight, will that be a problem??
5:14 British? What about the Northern Irish people? I demand this be altered! I will have a petition up later if Matt doesnt respond!
I can't wait for the outcome of this petition! Lulz!
UK government, such a parker square....
How about this skidding car as another topologically incorrect uk sign? \nhttp://c8.alamy.com/comp/EHC763/new-road-layout-ahead-and-risk-of-skidding-road-signs-uk-EHC763.jpg
But what if on the back side of the ball you have triangles?
What a Parker Sign.
People think maths isn't cool, and after watching you, I think they may be on to something.
Well, there is a reason why it has dark hexagons: It is displayed on a plane. For simplification reasons, they did not use a fake 3D image because this hexagonal picture scales better and is easier to reproduce (scaling for all this folks that doubt it, the lines towards the outside will get blurred if scaled down with pentagonal structures).
Ugh... This comment section has wonderfully illuminated the lacking sense of humour among the british public. Brilliant video Matt, don't let the not on my taxes lot get you down, they clearly weren't listening or comprehending.
Wow I never noticed that. Can anyone tell me if it is the same in the US?
So... it's a Parker football?
A) Hexagens?  Pentagens?\n2) The images of the castle and fish and elephant are not realistic either.
One day this man will run for a President!
Matt, thanks. I always love your videos. I'm not a UK citizen but would otherwise sign your petition. I realize that this video focused on your petition, but I'm a bit surprised that you didn't cover two obviously relevant digressions. The specific digressions that come to mind are:\n\nA) That the pattern currently depicted is a hexagonal latice which has a planar topology, like the street sign.\n\nB) That only a projection of a 3D shape (like a polyhedron can be depicted on a planar street sign, and what projection you propose the new signs using, (isometric, I presume?) Also might want to touch on the foreshortening around the edges on the projected polyhedron?\n\nC) The fact that, the inflated ball isn't truly a polyhedron, as the edges are arcs, not lines, and the faces aren't planar.\n\nD) History, repercussions and examples of Euler characteristics.
You should talk to a designer about what that would look like.\n\nAlso, none of those really look like the thing they represent except in an abstract sense.  For one thing, things rarely have holes that go all the way though, at least not ones you can see though.
On the sign, you can only see one side of the ball. Obviously, the other side contains different shapes which make it round like a football.
the current symbol really is a parker ball i must say
Can I just say that the elephant sign is used even if no elephants are actually present at the wildlife park indicated. That's what I call misleading.
I couldn't care less about football but now you have pointed this error out I won't be able to stop noticing it until it is fixed.
Just signed. There are now 17,462 signatures. Enough for his letter, but keep going and we might actually get someone to really do something about it.
Perhaps they should replace it with a prolate spheroid. Wouldn't that be better?
On the bright side, at least your government didn't want to make pi, or the equivalent of 0.5 * tau, equal to 3.2
BASTARDS!  Seriously, this is like the stock teamwork photo of three gears which contact each other such that they cannot function as gears. How can a country with such commitment to football/soccer get this so wrong? I blame it on the metric system.\n\n\nAlso - you need to find someone to produce a PDF version of the desired replacement to prevent an even worse version and to eliminate the 'what would it look like' stuck in committee problem. In fact, do one the way you want and also one that is obviously not-right in an aesthetic way to give the illusion of choice. People like picking the 'good one' and not having a preferred answer shoved on them.
Is there any kind of non-Euclidean geometry where an all-hexagon ball does exist?
Waste of time and expense, I hope this comes to nothing.
Suggestion: Provide an alternate design. People are much more willing to approve a change to correct something if they don't have to do what they perceive to be the hard part.
It's a bit brave to link Bristol FC with football, isn't it? Are you sure the sign represents a football?
I just feel sorry for all those motorists trying to figure out which lane to drive into seeing a sign with changing equations for geometry
Dammit I'm italian, I can't sign it
The number of sides on a pentagon is a prime issue... oh har har 5 is prime...
We'e living in a time of austerity though. The government spent £39m on legal fees to try to strip people of their rightful disability benefits, do you really think they'll waste money on something like this.... actually, something this pointless and petty does sound like exactly the kind of thing May and Hammond think matters
I *HATE* football, but I *HATE* mathematical/geometric errors more, so I have signed the petition.
That doesn't look *much* like a castle. The crossed arrow slit is either extremely rare or non existent.\n\nThe problem is that the surface the sign is on is flat, not a sphere. Therefore you can't cover it with a pentagon+hexagon coverage. I don't think the filmed actual football looks as football-like as the one on the sign.
Haha... although mathematically you are correct they still wouldn't match reality if they changed the pic. Nobody plays with that style of ball anymore anyway. The original one was called the Adidas Telstar introduced in 1970. The classic black and white ball. Used again in World Cup 1974 until being superceded by the Adidas Tango in '78. Originally the Telstar was introduced to help people see the ball more easily on black and white TVs.
Well since the regs have literally just gone through an overhaul I’d say it’s a nice idea but never gonna happen :p
I have signed many of those such petitions, but this is completely different from any petition I have seen on there before!
Can we just ban football altogether?
Without context I'm not sure I could've figured out what pentagins are.
This shows that brits knows as little about ⚽️ as them stupid Americans that calls 🏈 an football.
The ball on the signs does not look quite right. It seems unnatural.  Thanks for explaining the mathematical reason why,
I am in the US but glad to see you making a difference in society and mathematics
I almost spit out my coffee at 3:21.
the government [...] don't really care about mathematics and science.\nOOH, D'YA THINK?!
He says all other signs make sense, but the wheelchair one you can see when he is saying that doesn't contain a full wheel.
Isn't a parliamentary petition overkill? Surely you just need to get a memo to the right department...
In my opinion this is a real problem worth fighting for #footbolsignmatters
Concerning your claim that no such ball can be made of (possibly distorted) hexagons: While the mathematics is surely correct, this does not exclude the possibility that some other shapes (say, pentagons) were used at the *back side* of the ball (that is not pictured on the road sign). This probably makes a less symmetrical soccer balls - but if we allow strangely distorted hexagons for the faces of the soccer ball, why not also allow to use differently shaped faces at the backside of the soccer ball (that one cannot see on the sign)?
Tank training ground is a Cromwell on signs.
This is why petitions are jokes.
Matt, I am sure you can come up with an imperfect approximation to a ball made all with hexagons and we'll call it The Parker Ball.
Perhaps the street signs are incorrect in _Euclidean_ geometry, but here in the real world we use _Minkowski_ geometry. Can you make a sphere out of hexagons in Minkowski space?
We did it R̶e̶d̶d̶i̶t̶ YouTube!
That was an interesting video!  At first, I thought, Who cares?  But, then when I thought about it and how you only wanted the newly made signs updated, I realized it does matter enough to correctly display football images on newly made signs.  Way to go, I hope you get your petition positively recognized.  I cannot sign anything since the only part of me that is UK is long past ancestry.
Petition to make him pronounce hexagon correctly
It's a Parker soccer ball, it's valid in Parker geometrical spaces
Undoubtedly a serious problem. Now all we have to fix is all those arrows pointing to the sky. Am sick of getting misdirected into space. It really messes up my day.
Just did it don't even like football but if its 3D will look 10 times better
Am I crazy or does he have an australian accent?
It's worth noting that the icosahedron was used in the Fat Man atomic bomb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron#Applications\nIt seems the ball is changing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)#FIFA_World_Cup\nMatt is right on this one. The representation on the sign is obviously incorrect, and lots of math-inclined people would notice.
*What is the music that you use at the end of this video?*
I don't see any footballs, hexagins, or pentagins - only soccer balls, hexagons, and pentagons.
Will there be a petition to change the airplane icon too? A plane wont fly without engines.
Wow, my Dad told me about this a couple of days ago... I should have know you were behind it!! Haha

A ball made entirely of hexagons is known as a Parker Ball
Why not just get rid of all footyball nonsense in public entirely? It is a paupers game.
The zoo sign is also wrong!  Elephants' trunks always curl in, not out!
and where is the mathematics of a real football?\nhow many possible shapes can you combine to make a succesful football?
This is like saying the size and proportion of a castle sign is wrong we mist change it
Speaking as an American, I envy you that this is the worst of your mathematical problems.  8)
You've got too much time on your hands!
Woooo!!!!! Go Bristol City!!!!!!
Plane Ball: 1 Face - 0 edges + 0 Verticies = 1
HexagOn, pentagOn, gOn, GON!! O!!!'

sounds like helen czerski and raindrop signs
this man is awesome
Parker square ball
17,418 when I signed :)
Wow, those are truly parker-football signs
nice chalkboard
Wtf have I just watched
Icons aren't meant to be real, they are meant to be easy to see and quickly to be recognisable. – Signs don't use photorealistic iconography of other things like cars, lorries, trees, because that would make it not stand out. – Would a pentagon-hexagon ball be easier to see then a solely hexagon ball?
I think you've missed the point of asking why the football has hexagons rather than pentagons.  As you say in the video, hexagons tessellate on a flat surface, and it is this flat surface that the designer is trying to achieve.  All of the roadsign designs feature a flattened, simplified perspective.  By these rules of perspective, a sphere must be replaced by a flat disk, and so the mixture of hexagons and pentagons must be replaced with a hex grid.\n\nI would have preferred regular hexes, though.
Who cares, it's a small meaningless change... also will the government listen to a petition and then waste money on useless sign changes
Yah, but then you can round the hexigon, gcd lcm, so 6 into 5, 30.  You cant easily use 15 without a cooly ball.  But why not?  In 1995, they had advanced materials, whirly tennis balls, you could play tennis in the rain.  It was so bouncy and aerodynamic that you could dip legendary shots, in the rain.  Man that was cool because any old man with wilson whites wasnt anywhere, just your marine core tennis pals. LOL! The ball was fusia, neon, and indigo ripple like a racquet ball, but hat slight overweight and under pressure with poly fillament that grabbed the air, discontinued in 2001 due to cannibals?  I was mad one time, and i realized baseball,  Take a ball because my bat blows smoke?  Upper cut a top spin into the short stop hitting the grass square negative curl for a frack your mom douglas serve koopa troopa.  So it stands to reason that whirly cleats with ankle 400 lbs skocks an d carbide teath are so supperior that nobody could beat and defeat them.  So we learned in 1993 how to compound with a caroitoid lever for acceleration.
You need to do something about these ones as well!  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/55b76bec40f0b6790f000019/warning-sign-slippery-road.jpg

My daughter is in preK this year--she's one of 3 girls in a class of about 12-15. Yup, that's 3 girls and 9-12 boys. Her besties are all boys. Only down side is them teaching her to root for the wrong team--she came home today cheering for the Buckeyes when we're a Bobcat family! Austie [Austin] taught me that is apparently enough explanation. LOL.
#48 TRENDING!!!!
I’ve switched to PES and I’m never going back to FIFA
Paused the vid at 0:40. Went away for some time, forgetting about it. Came back, felt as if I had been watching real life football highlights.
This is what I wanted in a football game, a random dynamic gameplay with resemblance of realism feel to it. I don't see how some people enjoy FiFa dribbling through 6 players doing insane tricks and scoring goals after 2 minutes, that's not immersion of professional football on the pitch. That is the stuff you do when you play FiFa Street, not on the pitch.
Shooting still feels heavily unrealistic. Too much power on the shot regardless of who's playing it
Keep an eye on defenders, they are acting like idiots.
I am a fifa player and have to admit that the game looks much better than fifa 18
I really like the effect pass with outside of foot
I just cant see the realism in pes movements, players look like silly robots. I find fifa waaaay more realistic, and i don't think fifa is great. What pes does better than fifa is that pes have way more animations.
Animations look way more realistic than FIFA for sure...and I'm a FIFA fan!
Best  reviews man so far,  new subscriber :)
So all the pes bumlickers are gonna ignore that robotic moves in the beginning of the video. Who was he Lionel Messi? Fuck that
The problem with PES is its focus on realism. Because the ball and players move slower than on FIFA, it means that the defenders have to be less responsive so that there are still a lot of goals in a 6-minute-half match. This makes gameplay really frustrating for someone who takes pride in their ability to defend well.
PES come back, in my opinion, started with PES 2015. And Konami nailed this year. I played FIFA since 2015. That same year I switched to PES.
This game feels so good fucking love it
After buying Fifa every year since 2004, I finally decided to give PES a chance this year ... so glad I did.  The only thing that put me off pro evo was the lack of licencing, but just downloaded a mod for kits and names and it's all good.
Let me be honest....I only bought fifa 18 for ultimate team lel
hey! bro why are u only focusing on real madrid in this vid?!\nand, fifa 18 is better than pes 18\nyo..... the graphics,animation,gameplay......... and even more\nthe new player signing allows u to meet managers and players to fix the amount of the player to buy.\nthere is nothing MUCH new with pes! same old graphics.it still looks like pes 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbtw good video ;)
FIFA is for the boys, PES is for the men
Lol I belive PES 2050 will be more realistic than real life football
Who gives a shit honestly this game is boring and has shit game modes \n\nI agree their are more realistic animations but imo that all their is
What's the name of that camera its so cool
Since Pes 2006 only bought Fifa since starting from Fifa 10 new dribble mechanic and skills control have been introduced. This has caused Konami to adapt accordingly. After that I also bought Pes18 2018 and was rather disappointed. But this year, Pes18 is clearly the winner !. Skills are catchy and easy to handle, moves and attacks are dynamic, buttery animationn round off. Pes 18 is a simulation which already at the professional setting, but also with extended shot, pass and settings very high demands to the player. This challenge is not up to 815 fifa players
in this years i bought fifa...but in 20/21 i think that pes will be better than fifa
AI is brilliant in this game, I like FIFA 18 as well but mostly for multiplayer, the computer AI is too simple. The full backs in FIFA are way too stupid and always leave your offensive wingers free, so scoring from the wings is always where you will score most of your goals. While in PES it's way more varied.
Pes is literally like grand turismo and fifa is forza
How to setting Camera View ?
When I saw Lukaku's position I made my choice
In PES 18 can you create your own characters and put them on a team and play offline? I do that in FIFA a lot. Idk why I find it fun to play a game with a bunch of weird made up characters lol.
You just got a new subscriber for this great review
This year PES2018 is far better than FIFA18 !!
The Grass is Disgusting and the Goalkeepers are trash thats why i dont play this shit game
Great video! How about a FIFA analysis video? And another one with comparisons? Where FIFA is better, where PES is better, etc.
Your reviews would be much less realistic if you just cjange your camera to wide. Ppl just dont get it..
What's about the camera angles? It's the camera angles which add the realism
3:08 at first glance I thought it was a real match!\nYou have a new subscriber 😉
Which camera angel do you use?
It may be good but the animations dont match ur input in buttons like when holding the shot fully and the animation is a tap in ,doesnt make sense.fifas shooting and passing animations make sense half the time
Super realistic fast players like robots from other planet, and super real pitches
One problem in PES is the grass looks too clean. Its gotta look more realistic.
Finally someone explaining how good PES is! Thanks mahn! Hope every Fifa fan in the world watches this!🤘🔥
I am a FIFA fiend but piss looks SK real
It's a shame that online is another game.\nTotally.
Just waiting to have a Konami and EA collab one day to get to experience a football video game in its greatest and purest form
Their is a bug letting you score every freekick from the left and right side of the box. It sucks and also does fifa
it is impossible to score from distance. if shooting was like in pes 2013 or 16 it would be the greatest football. this is frustrating and stupid, not fun at all with this pes. realism is worthless without this. if someone can make it better or tell konami please do or we have another pes year wasted
fifa player since 96 and i always enjoyed pes more. i cant understand how people call pes an arcade game when fifa is far away from being realistic
This year im so disappointed with Fifa 18 keepers. This year pes is closer to fifa than ever
we had these videos every year, every year PES fans screams this is our year, but then nobody really cares. it's not 2005 anymore.
Anyone who plays football cannot buy FIFA.
If only pes had premier league licence and stadiums I would’ve bought it instead of fifa
Finally someone with the broadcast camera!
Konami should hire you for their promotion
What us the camera angle you have?
PES 18 is the best football game I've ever played, and I've been playing FIFA for the past 10 years
Not sure if this review is a joke...... but the game PES 2018 and realism should not exist in the same sentence. Am I the only one seeing that the animation of a skip slide before the players shoot or pass. Its like they are on Ice. Next ...the ball is not physically touch the players during heading ...it touches nothing. More so the players can only move in 16 directions ...does anyone know that? Pes has not adapted to the 360 movement for players as of yet. Therefore really sharp turns and arcade-ish gameplay.
I thought the scene with the heading goal right after the intro was from an actual soccer match. Very impressive
So can you only download a Pes patch on PC ?
FIFA's keepers play like Pes's this year.
All that has to happen is option file for xbox one,  then no one will buy fifa anymore. This game is too good!
What camera angle is this?
cr7,isco,kroos,cr7,cr7,even benzema,we know goddammit you are a madrid fan,dude you shouldn't be biased  this much ,\nyou provide a global content.and if you don't agree with me then change the name tomadrid of pes 18,you neglected ton of things by the way.
How is the bullshit? Same or better/worse than FIFA. Random pass directions, AI speed catch ups,  strong players being forced off the ball by weak little guys? How is manager mode and commentary? Player transfers?
U have a good eye dude!
I hope it feels great
Fuck! This angle made me think this is a real-life match
i usually buy both games every year, but i'm loving PES gameplay so much that i'm pretty sure i'm skipping FIFA18
I really hate konami. But this game are fantastic!
Basically an ad for pes. It’s not as good as you make it look.
Shit with that camera angle I really thought it was actually a real football match
so true that's all I can say
I have noticed significant strides in pes in recent years and I think that in a few years it will surpass Fifa
Good job. Nice video. I have subscribed.
I only bought FIFA 17 recently, and man it fucking sucks, one of the worst ones I've played, gonna go with PES from now on
the moment when you never played pes and realize it looks better than fifa
PS3/PS4 itu
Inverse-what now??
Look ugly
looks awesome but plays boring still :/
This year pes 2018 win
fix the nets pls shit looks so whack when you score
this is porn
PES is pure simulation unlike FIFA
pes nailed this year man (fifa player)
The grasses is bad
2:41 rekt
Hi, your videos are not only making me buy PES but also I'm going to buy a PS4 haha thanks!
How did you manage to remove the names of the players down left and right ? \nComment as-tu réussi a enlever les noms des joueurs en bas a gauche et a droite ?
I CANT ACCEPT PES AS REALISTIC WHEN PLAYERS SLIDE IN THE PITCH LIKE THEY WALK ON ICE...
Great compilation but please try to experience  with lower teams (like sevilla, liverpool, etc) to add more to realism
Great video again Knighmd, loving your reviews.\nNext step when you master the game is playing against cpu with full manual controls, I mean without pass and shot assist.\nMaybe you will have to set down the difficulty, but you will play a totally new and more satisfying game. You can check some plays on my channel to see what I'm talking about. \nCheers!
What camera do you use? Great video!
But does it has Benzema's signature open goal misses? That's the first thing you should look at.
returned it and got fifa 18 instead
Sorry. Fifa is still number 1 due to licences. Very soon, EA sports are going to have that Champions League licence and Pes will officially be dead.
I have both, tbh fifa 18 is better. Not in every way tho
Robotic movement you say realism\nOhh boy wake up.
KONAMI show us....license is not everything....huhu
1:03 Why is there nintendo publicity in the game?????
Unfortunatly my PES 2018 vergin shows deferences in some club logos as well as team names and shirts! Please teach me how to set them to thier real names
But how you got official kits of Manchester and other epl teams ? Patch available for crack versions ?
12/10/17 - #45 ON TRENDING !?!? lol this trending because of Harvey? lol

신파치...?
it's  so beautiful
Awe he wants to play poor baby hungry?
I would've stopped, and let it walk up to the car to observe its disposition upon coming face to face with humans. If you roll the window down just a tad and speak to the animal, you watch to see how it reacts. If it barks playfully and wags it's tail upon being spoken to, it's a domesticated animal and most likely safe. If the animal growls, snarls or shows any signs of general aggression, then it's obviously feral and shouldn't be messed with. By the playful way it was following the car, it seems quite likely this animal was used to humans, and possibly someone's pet.
I think this wolf is trying to tell something
sir, SIR! DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU ARE GOING?!
Poor baby! It was running after you for a reason. He needed help and you left him there. Sad.
Let’s try to get this video more dislikes than likes
He thinks they have food.  Someone from a car has been feeding him.
it was nothing friendly about the chases. the wolf wanted the baby inside for food
Wow you guys are really dumb. Have any of you even seen a 4 legged animal run after something with intent to kill it? Well the way this DOG was running was absolutely without harmful intentions. It was running with intentions of keeping up with the vehicle not to hurt the people inside. You guys are idiots
If this happened to me I would be screaming because I love wolves
I gotta stop reading the comments on animal videos. The comments go stupidly soft regarding animals. And then watch a video of people, and comments go stupidly vulgar and vicious.
It sure is a pretty animal.
He was just trying to tell you that you left your diaper bag on the roof
Oh he's chasing honey. Oh he chasing
for some reason this video really angered me. has me thinking that this is a wolf dog and someone has discarded it. i think it was begging for help.
Looked small for a wolf and more like someones Husky.
Lol at them listening to Say my Name by Destiny’s Child
Wolf= reincarnated mother in law
i think that is a siberian husky they just abandoned there haha
actually a werewolf about to turn back into a human, didnt want to walk home.
That is a Siberian Husky.
That was clearly a pet. Hopefully it wasn't theirs smh
Maybe they had a another dog and it passed away and came back as a wolf and he saw his family and tried to catch up to them :(
Thats actually a husky that wants to go home
@ViralHog that is clearly i sibberan husky i do not feel bad for you i feel bad for the dog. he was clearly lost. this is just mean to the dog.
Lemme ride in the passenger seat with the window rolled down!!!  Please!  I wanna see what it feels like!
Looks more like a husky to me
Are they sure it wasn't a Husky?  It kinda looks like a dog not a wolf
Just drove your fucking car off and try not to lure it to you.
people have probably fed him before thats why he's running after cars he expects food
He most likely want to change their minds about global warming climate change. It’s a hoax he wanted to say.
The resson why he followd the car bc he wanted water bc the gery wolf is hungry and thisty
That is not wild animal...\nIt is someones pat...
You must stop vehicle, I would.....
It's your dog right ? Pretty sick.
Such a great video, you have a great channel
That's a dog wanting those idiots to take it home with them ..
He just wants a ride  !
My snack is running away!
He's got your plate number, so it's not over..
It’s probably dead by now... just saying
GOD HELP ME! I'm so tired of ppl being so overly sensitive when it comes to animals. Some of the same ppl that treat each other like crap😒
More like you drove in front of the wolf...
You should have stopped. Not like it's going to rip the doors off the car. It might have been someone's pet, and just wanted a ride.
It's not a pet.you are food.
Oh you idiots. Thats rowly. He is a very well known wild but friendly wolf. I remember the area in the video. Its in canada. Me an some friends heard of rowly an we went to find him an meet him. He is a super kool wolfie. An he loves deer jerky.
Did you ever get rid of him/her
That wolf was tryna listen to Beyoncé on the radio
It may have been a pet. Please stop and check on it.
It was probably a line wolf thinking it had a huge kill
Why didn't you let him catch the car to see what he would do?
Wolf:  *There's a killer in the backseat! I repeat, there is a killer in the backseat!*\n\nAww, he's chasing us
Why would you not give him some food?
I would probably have thought that it was a lost dog and in a effort to help him I'd be immediately devoured.  😂
Idk o dont think thats a wild animal and if it isn't thats kinda fucked up if it's been left out there
Yep they just totally failed to help someone's lost pet.
Hes Hungry and someone has thrown food to him in the past from a car. Hes so hungry hes hoping for a handout.
How did a Wolf get in a car?
Beautiful animal.. he was probably hungry and trying to score some handouts from you.  Lone wolves don't have an easy time out there.
lol they listening to 'say my name'
They should've stoped. He may have been asking for help.
Aww that's cute but scary at the same time...
Awe! He looks like he wanted to play!
Whoa! That is cool, but one question: why was the wolf chasing the car?
Why wouldn't you stop for it? It clearly wasn't hostile, and as long as you kept your doors shut you would have been safe!
😓 It didn't occur to you to stop the car, crack the window, and give a quick whistle or pucker to check the reaction of the animal? If it came up to you car willingly with a friendly approach, it may have been someone's lost pet. This looks like a Malamute, without a doubt. Way too road friendly and even the way it runs is slightly more domesticated than the run of a wild wolf.
That's so fucked.. Don't toy with the animal. To be honest that looks more like a dog to me than a wolf, but I'm no expert on wolfs so I'm probably wrong.
What if came there to ask for help cause offtenly many wild animals ask help to human by following
That's not a wolf. Wolves have long legs.
That is not a wild wolf. A wild wolf will not get near people. That is a pet chasing his family. This is a screwed up video. I own a 95% Wolf Dog. He is my second wolf dog. I have had these animals for over 20 years and was raised in the country around wild wolves. I call total BS on this video!!! I hope this is not a pet being dumped. If the wolf dog was done this way to make a video then the owners should be ashamed of themselves. Also the wolf dog could have been hit by another car.
Take him home
Cool
Reincarnated lost relative
Agree it must have been someone's pet! Unrealistic demeanor for wild animal.
Husky?
Obviously a wolfdog...duh

WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE JEANS WITH THE HOLES IN THE BUTT,,,, I AM DESPERATE
Omg I want these so much!!!
am I the only one that noticed when she's showing the boots she's basically naked in the mirror lmao
i just came across your channel and your personality is fun☺️💞 but i just kept finding myself back away from my phone cuz u just seem tooo close upppp...like your face& lashes are screaming at me...make sense? yes😳😳😬😜
It's funny. because Riri spent $10,000 on hers and you spent $100. and it looks like the same damn thing but only yours just look better lol ... don't get me wrong Riri is pretty but just because she got money don't mean she's the beautifulest  woman in the world. but what you got on look like the same thing she got on it's basically the same thing but only they put hers on the higher cost which should not even be that much in reality .... and you pulled that look off just like she pulled that look off ....😂😂😊
good job got to make one
She's what I'd expect snow white to sound like but without the bland personality.
Honestly your shoes looks much better than Riri's, I would buy your DIY... Gorgeous QUEEN
I’m a muffin angel pie
Those boots are so gorgeous ! And you are so beautiful 😍
hi amber i love you videos. you always make me happy. i love your channel because you have such a out of the box style ,but i love it! and trust me i'm broke to girl. thank you amber and keep being you!!!!!!!!

LMAO What in the heck is up with asking?? how much coffee did she drink? Amber didn't drink no damn coffee she's just a fun person that is not boring she's always excited and thats a good thing (Coffee is a Shitty hot drink) that has caffeine in it that keeps you wide awake and you can die from it because you drinking too much it's not Soda or Pepsi caffeine is like a drug in your drink you drink that all the time you'll never get any sleep you'll be high as a kite and you'll start to have body failure meaning your body will start shaking on its own people it's not a joke thing with Coffee=caffeine your killing your self slowly.
Please please please don't change
How is your teeth so white?? I need to know! LOL

You are just so genuine to your followers and I love you for that! 💕 So keep doing you boo and keep up the amazing work! 💋
Why does she have eyebrows on her lash line?
I like your DIY better than the original tbh
You should do something with the lashes. They don't look that pretty
I could be Bill Gates rich, and still wouldn't spend 10K on some boots.  DIY boots looked good.

HAS HE NOT REALIZED SRIRACHA IS AN OFFICIAL WORD IN THE DICTIONARY
Dave as an og parodian from 200k I have to say the quality of your content has gone down. You mainly just eat food and do arcade games. I mean I guess some people are interested in that stuff but the stuff you did before with alboe was a lot better. I have also noticed that your sub growth has slowed considerably. Before in 6 months you gained about 1 mil subs. Now after 6 months you barely grew 700k.
I say\n\n\n\n\n\n TAKE IT EASY!
I tried the green tea and it was a negative 100,000,000
The green tea and cookies and crème are my favorite
Total Pockys of 18, 3 packages, 10 Pockys per package. \n\nNice Maths, David.
Angry hungry, yes I’m hangry\n\nBTS FANS WHERE YOU AT
…how is matcha green tea pocky third to last and cookies and cream fourth? Wtf
David there is Spicy nuggets at Burger King
Reminds me of the munchpak vids those were OG
David there is a different type of cookies and cream pocky it is like the almond ones it is role in a the cookie.
I've tried mocha one and banana and choco yum!
The macha ones were bomb wym

Paly DRINKO with Wolfie this Halloween  PLEASEEE 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Omg I felt the same about the cookies and cream! I was so excited to buy it but highly disappointed when I ate it ..

Who likes all the POCKY flavor
I love coconut and I watch this video where do u get coconut pocky
I'd stick my 3 inch pocky in your mama's cookie.
I tried most of the pocky in this video\nI ate all of them but the first two
The banana ones are one of my favorites...
Holyyyy fuck David you must try the new sizzerling salsa Doritos with cheese it’s a mussst I literally just had it it tastes peng as fuck 😱😱😨😱

Who remembers when david had more subs than wolfie.
The green tea is good yours is expired most likely
Pocky is my childhood and I’m still eating them now because I live in Asia :)

God damned it!!!!!!!!!!! I was born in 1992 nd 1 year later this astonishing tv show premiered which I never saw any of the original 9 seasons till after 2004 I saw some few episodes, then I stopped watching till again a few years ago I saw the complete 1st season nd the first 9 episodes of the 2nd season which then again I stopped watching; but now I'm gonna definitely continue watching from where I left off b4 the 11th season premiers. I'm a huge ass fan of The X-Files specially 4 its creepy opening theme song by Mark Snow.
One million will be reached soon
Well, little bit off topic here. Can somebody please tell me am i correct or wrong.The question is....\n\n\n\n\nDid x files season 10 just erase the all the alien flick from season 1-9 ? I mean did they just like “nah man it was never alien it was all goverment conspiracy? If so then what about all alien black goo thing? What about that 1940's original alien invasion or somethng?
Everybody wearing trenchcoats...coming 2018...to an office near you.
The soundtrack is lit! Can someone tell me how its called ?
julian and jones saved your franchise, don't let podesta destroy it by association , wake up
The last season sucked...hope this one is better.
What is the song that starts at 1:00 ????
It's nice to know that the end of the trailer had an Asgard, probably Thor, dealing with the situation. Any friend of General O'Neil's is a friend of good old Agent Mulder !☺️
Scully and Mulder? Omg, I can't believe they are back!!!
Always fun. 📽 👽
Agent Scully's still hot.
im a little busy taking a knee, so probably cant watch
*Pillows for adults.*\n*https://www.etsy.com/magicworldmira/listing/562507151/*\n*Give a special, intimate atmosphere of passion - in your bedroom, with pillows for adults.*
ohh and it has aliens again im so gonna watch this even though ill have nightmares
Been waiting 4 this for a long time...
The show has become so absurd and dreadful in a 'mad scientist slowly losing his mind' sort of way.
Looks like Krycek is the only person that's not returning from the dead this season.
where is the noire? :c
this season will be showed on tv in 1 year 1 is the first number number contains 6 letters 6 - 1 is 5. 5 + 5 is 10. 10 team 10 jake paul \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx files jake paul confiermeeeeeeeeeuuued
There is a god above...
omg the trailer is on fleeeeeeekkkkkkk can't wait for season 11!!!!!!!
Is this real??? I hope so.
I only watched the first couple of seasons. I liked it more when each show was more of a one off.
Oh no it looks bad
Scully ages like a fine wine! What is she eating or drinking?? Lol
First off didn't the Morley man get blown the fuck up in a cave after being shown with a tracheotomy? Second off please no more honky tonk budonkadonk, ever.
PHEW .... can breathe again there is another series ..... thank you!
Didn't all the Lone Gunmen die? Well I guess so did the CSM so anything is possible. I'm super stoked.
Note to self: buy another carton of Morley's....
Hopefully they run into Fringe Division.
People of earth and this must be connected.
Now just make season four of millennium
Every time someone says Agent Einstein' it sounds like sarcasm. Hope this season is better.
and rain pours down in vancouver, ha ha ha
Scully dies at the end of this season
no lot call officially makeup throat rub mayor pig talented wisdom.
British guideline matter bfhwl succeed own hungry landing both prime.
I don't like this, Skinner meeting with CSM.
The trailer looks amazing! So looking forward to season 11!
I would give it an extra thumb up for using a cover of Zombie in the background, that song was definitely in my 90’s soundtrack, I would sing it over and over again back then. Also... do they want to tell us something with that song? It’s all in their heads?
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
Finally more x-files.. the wait was to long..
2018?! WHY?!
Netflix please bring back the x-files
Oh god It's Fine Though I live in Russia.

This is The X-Files 11th season... and my penis is 11 inches long. COINCIDENCE?!?!?!
Lol does  FOX know that the theme song is the Illuminati song on the internet
The little aliens are getting cuter. So cute.
Aliens are demons, outer space is fake and .......\nThe Earth is _______FLAT!_________
I really hope Season 11 is going to have the creepy spooky chilling vibe of the first six seasons, because the seasons 7-10 were so awful.
I'll Be Your Pilot debuted at #7 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkY6RV0nVEA&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5&index=7
3 days later, and I haven't been able to stop listening. This song grows in you, discreetly and without mercy...\n\nWell, most Belle & Sebastian does.
Again the kind of music I put on at night and lay in the dark thinking of nothing but the music and the imagery it provokes <3 thank you for making my life better, b&s!!!
Even a brand new song by you evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia in me 💛
Just can't stop listening to it <3
damm this is sweet
I love how they can go back to their roots or evolve, but they never loose that beautiful characteristic sound.
Cool that the best band in the world announce their new project on International Mental Health Day. I LOVE B&S <3
This is not nostalgia, it’s just a band doing the usual, without being affected by the poor music changes from the last 15 years
it's like i'm watching life in a movie
Omg this song is just as astonishing as Nobody's Empire 😍
So I made the cover of this EP, the good looking one in the hat..
Amazing work as always guys. Love it!
I'M IN LOVE
dig the song! here's a brief write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/ill-be-your-pilot-belle-and-sebastian-youtube-audio-single
I just loved it!
OMG new song!!  I love it
Can't wait to hear more!
Such a sweet song! Love you Belle and Sebastian 😚😍😘
Belle and Sebastian is Back!! *-* ..
omg I'm so excited! I love it! Thank you, Belle and Sebastian!
Wow! New sweet music of my favorite band!!! Love it! Thanx!
It's just so lovely  and relaxing

Yaaay! :)
great work
Ich liebe Euch. Greetings from BVB-City.
Beutiful 😍 Love it 😊 Come to Mexico someday please :3
Needs a stronger melody and Lying here in the sweet sahara is like something a sixth former in English class would write.\nB&S were always bitter-sweet, but this is just plain mawkish.\nI loved Nobody's Empire and some bits and pieces off the last few albums, but it does feel like they've kind of petered out creatively.
Reminds me of the music from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocd1D8fwdjU
I love you, guys.
Nice try to retrieve some of your original sound. Utter failure though, atmosphere is lacking.

The voice break scared me.
This is number one trending! Ffs what has the world come to
LET ME TALLLKKKK\n\n\n\n\n\nI get the slight impression he wants to talk
All footballers are chavs nowadays, no class or dignity, they all just sleep around and get ridiculous amounts of money for kicking a dumb ball around some grass whilst having uneducated chavvy football hooligans chanting or fighting other people because their team lost, dumb idiots.
They were just looking out for him but damn should of let the man tohok
Better to talk than bite right
He sounded like a German Kermit the frog.
DEAR YOUTUBE, I HATE FOOTBALL STOP RECOMMENDIMG IT TO ME
He sounds like a little boy going through puberty 😂
Sounds like a 14 year old
Like, he is screaming at his wife ... \nLet me  falk.
Poor guy only wanted to talk.... I actually feel sorry for the dude with how his team shut him down.
it's just a game....

Is it’s cause he’s ginger?
Yo, guys I think he is saying something.
The Twix didn't want the ginger bread man to talk...

Awesome
You look fantastic!
you should try Paltalk
Black lampshades with dark throw look fabulous, Fleur!
normie bs
Love it :D
perfect 😍😍
👌🏼👋🏼👋🏼🇲🇽😊
Vlog set up is great! Esp if easier for you going forward with your little one! 😊 Also loving the idea doing it by 'themes'  - scarves etc and jumping round rather than dividing by shops 😊. xx
You have such a nice voice, I want you on my sat Nav 😀
1.5 mil channel, 50k views in 15 hours.. gets on trending page, great job YouTube
Yes keep using this camera~ its loads better (no blurry back ground) woo hoo x
Love it Fleur!!!! You are by far my fav youtuber 💝💝💝💝
If u sub me I will sub back , let's help each other out xxxxx
I think the setup is great and you look so beautiful I cannot stop smiling to your video 😁sending lots of love from Denmark 🇩🇰❤️❤️❤️
The more I watch Fleurs videos, the more I want to meet her for a cuppa and just chat!  Xx
1: your hair is AMAZING\n2: I like the normal set up for tutorials and favorites, but this is ok for first impressions and reviews - it's up to you anyway.\n3: I love the fact that you mix pregnant clothes with normal clothes. My friend is pregnant and she's had enough of pregnant clothes.
I'd like a mix of both camera style :)
You should totally do a trainers / tennis shoes collection video! 😄
I like both of them 😊 but this is way more cozy😄
i like your necklace Fleur! i like either set up.. the cut aways with this one it was kinda hard to see good. like was that a high low sweater? or was a longer piece attached? also, buy yourself a nice clothes steamer! changed my life girl! xo editing.. buy the steamer and then say In your face Mike De Force! LOL xoxoxo
I like when u film on blog camera even tho it looks less professional but when u can and have time film on the DSLR.
❤️ U ,  just a tip for sneakers I use baby wipes to clean the white parts and they can look new for as long as they are loved.
Love this style of video. The clothing you selected all looks great on you.
Get a steamer! I hate ironing (and am terrible at it), but steaming things is way less annoying and just as effective for most women’s clothing.
Loving your hair Fleur, such a gorgeous colour 😍 Camera quality is great with your vlogging camera xx
if you find ironing difficult, get a hand steamer! they come as cheap as 20 quid on amazon. i used mine every morning, so much easier than getting the iron and ironing board out ;)
Amazing video Fleur loved it 😍😍😍 and is trending now as #3 🎉🎉🎉
I love your videos on the vlog camera <3
Love these outfits, also your hair looks so lovely! x
Really cute items!! 😍  Love the more casual setup ❤️
Very pretty makeup. X love your videos! Xxx
I prefer this camera and set up. Feels a bit more old school YouTube and more casual xxx
Perhaps French navy is the colour? A lighter soft navy. Tres chic!
I like this setup!
Like the blue on you, it suits you, love the necklace you have on where's it from? Not technical with cameras but this looks good x
I like the vlog camera, but don't mind the other. Some lovely pieces - zara scarf n the dresses particularly.
hi fleur, i like the camera shot, looks good :), the jumper dress is very nice good buy! the blue cardigan is cool looks good :)
That slip dress and jumper combo is 🙌🏻 🔥!!
Me personally wouldn’t have spent £200 on the all saints 2 peace as your not pregnant for long and won’t really get price per wear out of it but it does look really nice
love your videos, the image on this camera looks great but i feel like there is a lot more of that white noise than normal.
Fleur, I love your dark brown bed spread/throw. Where did you get it from?
Going to London next week! Where should I go to shop?
I don't like this setup. In the name video with Mike, your face kept going out of focus and it did it a couple times in this video as well. Plus, I don't know if it's the camera or the room, but you look like you're on a house boat the ceilings are so short. It's odd.
All u háve is a bump uve no baby weight oñ
Love the lip color you are wearing.  What is it?  Please do tell.
Please tryy to not cut the top of your head. I think it's better when the face is more in the center. Think a grid photo. You dont put the object on top :)
The Cardigan: I'd say 'Slate Blue'. ;) Nice things. Especially the layered black dress from Paris.
Pleaseeeeee what lipstick are you wearing?\nLooks stunning on you xx
I like your regular setup better, I think the video and color quality is nicer.
I think the set up looks fine, the quality looks spot on xx
Both set-ups are great. It just depends on the type of videos you're filming. It's also nice to switch things up every now and then.
I think the vlog setup is cool
Loving those outfits 😍 Wish I could start wearing Fall clothes but it's still so hot in LA!
I love that pink cardigan! :)
I prefer the other setup but nice video!
You seem so happy in this video. You always do but genuinely your personality is bursting through the screen.
Just FYI, it's extremely bad Feng Shui to put a mirror over your bed!!!!!
I like this camera more.
I love your videos Fleur! You seem so organised, I like that 😅✨🌸 and I like the 'professional' camera, I like that it focuses on your face so you can 'concentrate' better, at least that's my view on it :)
Love all of your pieces! The scarf looks incredibly cozy!! So glad you found so many things you love, it is definitely hard to shop for things when you are pregnant.
Beautiful! I just love the cardigans. White or cream underneath would be my colors of choice I think. It would show off some pretty jewelry. Thank you for sharing, it's so much fun.  :-)
You are looking extra beautiful here, Fleur!  And love the color of that last cardigan on you!
Fleur you look gorgeous! Love everything that you bought, especially the dresses & the Zara scarf😍😍
Love the scarves. You look so beautiful in this video :)
i like camera vlog and love your haul
Yes please do more autumn hauls! Fall fashion! Fall candles and decor! All fall and fleur de force hauls all day ! 😍 only thing is I think the background room is a bit dark and dismal compared to your usual filming room.
I think that colour blue really suits you. Xx
You must be one of the most stylish pregnant ladies I've seen!
I adore the Nina Kandosa black dress on you! It's a great cut for a baby bump. You've got some great pieces. I like either setup, do what ever is easiest. Hugs, Summer xo💗
They all look great on you Fleur! Wish I could get my hands on all of them!
Love the set up 😊
Hi guys! I have an upcoming beauty and fashion channel!! There's a new haul video online! Check it out! 😉https://youtu.be/VPJE0j-DDhA 😄
I love this set up and Camera. You seem closer to the viewer and more like a friend wants to tell you something, it doesn‘t looks so professional (i like that) and not so much, that it is your Job
How do store all your scarves? Could that possible be a video?
I don't mean this in a bad way but the baggy clothes totally hides the bump. You could only really see the bump when you move your hands around it. It kind of makes (all pregnant women not just you) look bigger than you are because that bump is hidden under all the fabric. Sweaters are totally an exception but when it comes to dresses and shirts i think its more flattering to be in a stetchy almost skin tight (without actually being tight) top that way you don't look frumpy you just look pregnant. In the end just wear whatever you are comfortable in! I just think baby bumps are cute and should be shown off.
PLEASE DO A NAIL POLISH VIDEO!!!
omg that grey scarf is beautiful!! it looks super soft!! lovely haul xx
I love your videos! I have been having a awful month and your channel always makes me smile and just forget about everything else going on. Thank you so much!
Its like beening plus size,  ya love all the clothes but there never in ur size xxxx i feel ur pain xxx wish the made all clothes to fit everyone 😀,
The colour of that deep red coat is really lovely
The color of that blue cardigan looks absolutely gorgeous on you with that lip and your hair color! Looking stunning as ever!
Pregnancy brain is a real thing medically! All your blood is going to the baby and not your brain! (;
You will wear those cardigans nonstop with like a black nursing tank if you are going to breastfeed. That will be your uniform for awhile;) but the cardigans you picked out are so cute you will look great doing it! Great style as always!
Love the blue cardigan on you. The blue looks good with your skin tone 👍
It’s a little hard to see the clothes when you’re trying it on because of the window in the background
The quality looks great! Perfect for hauls and reviews. However, I think I'd prefer the other camera for makeup tutorials and get ready with me type videos. XO
Loved your haul Fleur and yea this video quality  is perfect , you are looking beyond glowing. 😘🙏😘✨🌟😘
Great haul! Love the vlog setup! Love you!!
Give your scarves a wash with loads of fabric softener before you wear them. Stops the fluffing
Prefer this camera for clothes haul....😁
WOAH,  yikes a $600 dress. TBH, it's a pretty two-piece dress, but I don't see anything special for it to cost $600 though for real though.😯
Superga have some new grey trainers with silver stars on them and I immediately thought of you!
I just purchased the same coat and LOVE it! ❤️
Great video. I went to Zara the day I saw you in that red/pink scarf on your IG. It is so cute and cozy.  I actually bought two scarves and green velvet shoes too but hey, I deserve it!!
Love the camera set up for hauls! It’s more personal. Professional is nice too sometimes but you don’t always have to go all out! I like the simple and human side of your videos too 😊 you’re a very polished lady, you don’t have to have perfectly polished videos 24/7 too, you still shine through lower quality cameras too, dear!🎉
I lived in cardigans like that after my daughter was born. Those and some leggings and a nursing tank make me feel a little more put together when we would have visitors but I was still comfy with easy boob access for nursing.
Love the vlog camera for this haul, and also really enjoyed this video.. I'm now gonna get those 2 pairs of runners 😊

Cute vlog
Female jack black??
Mark looks like thom yorke!?

Lily ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Missing you Lily! ☹️
I really enjoyed this couples blog, nice to see you guys having fun.  I've been wanting to stay at the hoxton for months now, going to text the hubby now 😉 x
Ooh I read about the Gingerline only a few weeks ago as I’m heading to London soon.  It looks great but sadly it’s only for over 18s and I’ll have my 16 yr old daughter on this trip.  I love This Works extreme moisturiser for winter.  I find that brand really good but it doesn’t get too much interest here in Australia. Their pillow spray really does seem to work.
Don't speak. wow. one of my favourite songs.
Lovely vlog- the two couples together is always a good time! Nice to see Lily! I want to try that foundation also!!
I could watch your vlogs all day!
Around 3.50 I paused the video as my 12 year old walked in and asked me something.  When I got to hit play again, all we could hear was when he farts!  My daughter was cracking up!  The best breaks are the ones that feel like you've been away for ages and like you've been on holiday!
y'all are cute.  looks so fun!
I loved this! I missed Lily, I missed the couple vlogs, I missed the London weekend activities. This filled so many voids I didn't know I had!! xx
Wish The Ordinary would launch here
Ahhhh I miss Lily! This was a nice vlog, you all are so funny together! It’s a shame you don’t get on very well 😂
Looks like you guys had a fun weekend! Just adore you two! So funny, boys are shopping and you two are tagging along... Love it!
You are such a joy!
So glad to see you two together and Lily looking so happy ❤️ can’t wait for her to come back!
i want lily's coat  , great vlog xx
Half watching this just to get a lily fix  🙈 obviously so much love for anna too ❤️
did viewers really think Lily was preggers... never crossed my mind.  but i knew she wouldn't be away too long from youtube...  i saw someone w Lily's coat the other day :)
Great vlog, looks like you had fun!! x
Always lush to c u hanging out together guys♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ahh nice to see lily! Great vlog Anna x
MISS YOU LILY! Hope you all are doing well :)
So good to see Lily.  Glad she is ok.. Great video!
Totally loved this vlog ❤ So nice to get some tips for our next trip to London 😃
Thanks for taking us along, Anna! It was lovely :-)
I rarely (if ever) comment on videos, but this was so lovely I can't resist! I love how relaxed and authentic this vlog feels, a pleasure to watch. xx
I miss Lily so much!
What is this bs
OMG!! NO2 ON TRENDING! 😱 you go girls! 💪 Missed seeing both of you in a vlog 💓
Sorry but that intro was so satisfying I had to rewind it and watch it twice haha! Love your vlogs x
This was the perfect little vlog to watch on my lunch break! Was lovely to see Lily happy too.
Lovely vlog Anna! And so nice to get a glimpse of Lily again. You are more then welcome back to youtube/internet when/if you feel ready for it @lilypebbles ❤
I stayed at the Hoxton in London and it was awesome! The lobby is like a collaborate workspace in the day and a nightclub at night! It was crazy. They also give free breakfast every morning
How the fuck is this #2 trending?
Lily looks so cheerful 😀
Missing Lilly!!!! 😏
LILYYY!

Love when you four hang out together (even though it doesn't affect me at all lol)
Lilyyyyyy i miss youuuuuuu it madré me so happy to see your precious face
I miss Lily so much :( Great video as always xxx
Great to see Lily again. She really looks like she is enjoying her little screen break.
This vlog is so amazing! Love it so much 💕
This is exactly why I LOVE being on YouTube - the friendships you can make xx
I miss Lily so so much! It's taken up til now to realise why YouTube isn't the same, and its cause my sub box is lily'less *cries* But she is SO happy, can see it in her face, happiest she has looked in a long time, so if this is what she needed then fab! I just hope she isn't gonna come back unless she actually wants to!
Loved this mini vlog! I really want to stay at The Hoxton , looks so cool. I must buy that foundation at some point. 💪🏻
Aw its so nice to see Lily again, definitely missing her videos! xxx
Can’t wait for a review of the ordinary foundations!!
Using my the ordinary foundation while watching this....
I'm going to London at the end of the month so what are your tips for eating out and some non-touristy sights?
I've just realised how much I miss Lily ❤ great vlog Anna
i'm so desperate to get out of london but then i see videos like this with new brunch  spots and then  i;m like like oooooooooooooooo
Love 500 days of summer!!!!
Hi Lily!!!!!!!   So good to see her face!     I love your vlogs Anna!  💕💕💕
I LOVED this vlog!!! You and lily both looked gorgeous I would love to hear your thoughts on the foundation!
Who had to pause to like the video when Mark did his little haul 😜😂?
you all seem so happy :') ahhhhh what a great vlog!!!
I totally wore my hair like that back in the day!!! 😂 Anna, you looked so cute when you were talking about Lily and the donuts! 😍 Also, this made me realize how much I miss Lily!!! 😭😭😭
The hills are alive, with the anna and lily music! 😂. Just kiddin' but it's só nice to see you both! Good vibes with the 4 of you! And than Mark who's ironing his shirt! 😂😂 Véry well trained! Makes me want to go to London. You lot cost me a bloody fortune!! Stockholm: ✔, New York: ✔.......😂😘
Ahh I've missed Lily!! I love your vlogs especially when it's with you ladies, always look like you are having so much fun 💕
I swear there's something different about Lily - she seems very happy! Dont know if it's because of the break or because of good company.. also, why do we LITERALLY go to the same places but never bump into each other :(
So good to see you & Lily together!
So nice weekend! Glad to see Lily so happy!
I love Lily's Je ne sais quoi shirt so much! I immediately knew it had to be from Whistles (and to expensive to justify for me)
Great to see Lily, hope you're having a nice break. Great Vlog Anna x
We’ve missed seeing you Lily!!!! ❤️
Now im really starving 😅 Nice to see you both 👯
Which experience did you go to at the Ginger Line? there seems to be a few on the website
I miss you Lily !! Hope you're feeling better & great content Anna. Lotsa love xxxx
Pls pls follow Kris Aquino!! Her youtube chanel is  @Theaquinos, shes very famous  celebrity in the philippines and she likes and watches your videos!! She acknowledged you in one of her videos. Thanks :)
Could you do a review of the ordinary foundations you purchased? Quite curious. Love the vlog!!
How does bullshit like this kind of vlog even begin to trend ?
So nice to see Lily again 😉 Great vlog!
Lily looks  really chic in her outfit... you both look great..love your styles
Not only do we get Mark, but Lily and Rich! 💙💚💛💜
Your handsome husband, irons!!! Love him, even more!! I always look forward to when you and Lillie do a video together!!
Paused the video to comment and say HOW MUCH DO WE MISS Lily??!!! But also let’s note how happy and refreshed she looks. Take however long you need Lily but come back to us soonish... thanks for this great video Anna. I smiled thorough out the entire vlog!
Absolutely love this video! Do they sell all of the 'The Ordinary' skin care range at the deciem store? I really want to try it out, but I am not the biggest fan of shopping skin care online. \nx \nOne happy subscriber
I love this. It is so nice to see Lily, I miss her on the internet so much but I'm so glad she's enjoying her break. Massively wishing i had bumped into you both in London now I've moved here. Let's hope I do next time
Hahaha the funfact about your  mom spraying at you dad's farts really made me laugh.
Lily is so happy how cute😍 \nActually, I am a little disappointed there' s no baby coming😂
So great to see lily
Wait, Lily is taking a MONTH off?! :( :( :(
Still NEED to visit London! Loved this vlog! You and Lily are both so cute! Xoxo, Caylie
Damn Demi you are such an empowering women. I love this documentary so much!! You are so strong . I will forever love you Demi! ❤️
This is the best and most real thing ive watched in a really long time I Love you demi continue to inspire people, I know you inspire me 💞💞
Fuck. Demi has got me all up in my feelings! I absolutely love this girl
so moved demi. thank you for sharing this with all of us. we love you!
They should of make this a movie
Thank you Demi for sharing you life. Your voice has inspired many. Your music has cured many. We love you.
What's the song she's recording at 2:10?
i watched camp rock when i was little but i never really knew anything that really happened to her bc it wasnt big news in my country and i didnt read entertainment industry news about foreign people. its really nice to know what actully happened and how far she has come. a beautiful woman inside and out!
You say that family should support us when my family would never support me if they knew the true person I am if they knew I cut myself they would never look at me the same way and if I killed my self they wouldn’t even care probably
Such an amazing documentary❤️ Demi is so inspiring and such an honest person, love you demi x
I love this woman so much! She's my inspiration. I've stuck around her through everything she talked about.
I fell in love with her voice and then with her! More power to you! <3
I always loved Demi, and i know i'm just simply a fan, but just to let you know we're always here to support you, we're so proud of you for putting this out for us to see what it's like, with such strength and confidence ❤
The best documentary i have ever seen!!!! soooo full of emotions it was crazy!! love you even more now, if it was even possible<3<3<3
Girl.....I know everyone has their own past....n everyone is going through something... But the way u handled yourself was incredible....it takes lots of courage to face yourself n u have dat courage....God bless u... I love u....n this documentary is really inspiring....it just lifts my spirit.... N remember we all love u
Thank you Demi for making this accessible to your fans. It just shows how much you wanted to get your truth and message out.
❤️ I've always loved Demi, but this just made me love her even more. So much respect for her.
The girls who bullied you, you showed them!!! Now they would do anything to even get a glimpse of Demi Lovato.
Your are truly my biggest idol! I'm currently struggling with eating disorder, but I really got my hopes up that I can get through it because of your story. Your strong personality is glowing with kindness and warmth. I hope that I'll one day make you see the difference you'll make for me <3\n\nThank you
This touched my heart so much. I love you for showing us Demi. Like that’s some real shit and shows us we can all come out of any situation strong.
Does anyone know the song at 39:58 ?? It sounds so beautiful
I laughed, I cried, I sang along but mostly I related to your story. I admire your strength and courage and I thank you for sharing with us. This will help A lot of people and they will know that they are not alone.
Demi deserves the world....  My 👑
you are an amazing woman demi !! , you have been one of my idols for years and im glad to see how far and strong you have become . hope all the happiness in world for you and your future <3 x
Looooooooove this. Please do a tour around Australia. Ilyssssssssssssssssssssssm.
I literally have loved you since the first time I saw you on as the bell rings. Was angry for you when the Miley and Mandy show bullied you, shit the first song that mended my broken heart was don't forget. We are older now, and I know this is still an earlier chapter, but damn fucking shit I love you so much.
Love how open she is & hows she’s making a difference now ❤️👏🏼
Just Wow <3 (tears from being moved) This has got to be one of the most inspirational things I've seen, and this is up there. I've definitely taken really good things by just witnessing #Demi's life. Wow, speechless. Watched it through without pausing, you could hear a pin drop if the sound was muted. Thank you very much. <3
LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH <3
Damn I feel that I felt moved by her story like this gave me chills yo fr fr I have so much move respect for her now Demi just damn yo just damn 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥 I appreciate the fact that you are just so real about your life. Everything that you said & did to overcome this is just life changing & I appreciate that you got love from me thank you for that.
the last time I did an interview this long I was on cocaine... that single line told me this was gonna be a vulnerable yet strong and deep documentary and I was not wrong...  Demi's voice has always caused me goosebumps cuz its so fucking good and knowing all this I just want to thank her for continuing doing music and saving people even when she wasn't okay...  💞
You’re a amazing! I’m so proud of you.. thank you for being real & honest with us... you’re my biggest inspiration ever & your music has helped me through so much.. I love love you dems! 💞💞
You are such a beautiful human being! I know that you're just starting with your journey, and I definitely know that you'll become stronger than ever.  💕💕💕💕😇
Amazing and overwhelming!! All her ... she is just a little drop of magic 🌼☉
I have never been a Demi fan until recently and I am truly amazed with her story and the direction she is now on. Definitely a different perspective and applicable to many facing the same struggles. Very refreshing
😍😍😍 ur music has got me through so much in life ! Wish I could put it all in a song ! I would scream it to the world everyday .
When Demi's new doc is FREE but Katy Floppy's is on YouTube Red😂👍
This was really great Demi. God bless
WOW just..wow!  My cheeks hurt from smiling like a dork. I'm just so happy for her and for myself and seeing what I could achieve from learning to love myself a little everyday, step by step♥
love this so amazing, really shows you that eveyone is struggling in there own way nomatter who you are , stay strong everyone <3
I knew a little about Demi's past  bc I've always admired her but she has never been this outspoken about her life before. \nA few things I already knew were that she is hilarious, beautiful, talented, strong and passionate. I love how truthful this woman is. There are plenty of female artists I would love to meet and she is defenitely on the top of my list. 👏👏👏👏💜.
Powerful. This was a beautiful glimpse into her life. Just lovely. <3
I struggled with addiction and bi polar disorder. The only difference is she is famous and I'm not. This was powerful and inspirational and the stigma attache to this disease has made me feel not so ashamed for this. Thank you Demi.
I love you so much. You help me want to be better. You help me realize that this my dream. Thank you for all you do. I have experienced some of the same things you have. I can't thank you enough for all you do and your music. I hope one day i meet you. I hope one day i can sing for you. I hope we can just sit down and talk. I love you demi. Thank you.
Demi, thank you for being so real and honest and wish you all the happiness in this world. You deserve it all. -e
This is amazing!! Also her and her sister look so much a like
What the actual F!! THIS WAS THE BEST EMOTIONALLY WONDERFUL DOC! It was soooooo amazing!#EmotionalInspiration. Literally so my respect for Demi I know this was hard af!:& inspiring
wow. tears of happiness. Love you forever Demi!
I thought he said your an escort😂
your amazing! i love this, your so real and inspiring!
She’s so strong 💪 \n\nHow Inspirational ❤️
yeyyy...ouh n shila amzah from malaysia is in there toooo
please whats the name of the song playing on 36:23
Wow i didnt know this much stuff about her i knew she was sad but not like that
I love you...you have a life most people dream of....make it count
So in love with this sooo amazing 💕
I love her so much. Since Disney. And I’ve fallen in love with how far she has overcome. I appreciate how much she has learned, loved and lived within different experiences. It’s life. Things happen. Keep going Demi. You are amazing. I love you 😩❤️😭
This is real. This is so full of encouragement and motivation. The first thing that came to my mind when she mentioned the drugs was Amy Winehouse has a documentary as well, but it came out after she passed away. I am so glad Demi could make her own and work throught it. So happy to know shes still here with us! Thank you so much for being this strong and beautiful person.
I'm currently drunk and struggling watching this, crying and feeling so confused, you're such an inspiration.... god knows I try to feel.. even if I can't understand..
Free . I value this . I cried a lot lol. I'm glad you've come far .
Props to all the people who stayed thru all her episodes, horrible moments, give ups, && the beautiful outcome. You the REAL ones 💜💜💜
First of all.. this was perfectly imperfect the way she was so raw and open about everything. \nBut am I the only one that noticed the laugh at 9:53? Like she’s always had her signature laugh. Love everything about this. So much inspiration and love 💛
Holy shit, I knew when I first watched camp rock I fell in love with “Sunny” (Demi) and I’ve followed Demi as an artist ever since. I mainly fell in loved with her music and her beautiful voice.\n\nFast forward all these years, I’ve developed something mentally that has been devouring me and I’m too scared to get diagnosed or get help... watching Demi get through those things made me realize that I should and can, and weird enough every word she spoke about how she felt in those times is exactly how I would describe my mental state. \n\nThanks Demi ❤️
Demi this is such a great documentary you are beautiful and I love ur music so much!💗
the new album is life!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
the ending thooooo😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Stay Strong ❤️
Speechless ❤️
❤️❤️❤️

Check out this goo.gl/ktZNq1
this is fucking beautiful
:)
Might be a placebo but the cameras even look nicer , clear .
28:22 if only more people thought like that
I love Greg! hope he decides to go the video route on his podcast... I love the visuals.
that NBA player is one of the dumst fucken people on this earth  nice putting that white made ball in the hoop you playing your sport is black entertainment for the white people  lmao dum asses
Why don't they cry cultural appropriation when black girls spend thousands of dollars to put white girls hair in their head?
Bring back the old studio!
5 times a month... dude that ain't shit.  You're basically an occasional toker. I doubt you need more than a few puffs to get ripped.  Like a baby. For people who smoke regularly, you can't just cut it off suddenly without withdrawals like getting the sweats all over (sweaty palms and pits especially), intense anxiety, can't sleep or eat for like 2-3 days, feelings of irritation and anger, erratic thoughts, and shit like that.  It sets in all on its own even if you just keep on doing your thing and forget about smoking.  I've been out for a couple days now since my stash ran out and my hands are sweaty while I type this.  For people who say they smoked daily for many years and then suddenly just stopped with zero effect, they are either the sort who only ever smoked like a few tokes or a bowl a day or else they are in denial and/or lying. I always get accused of being uninformed for telling people this but I've grown many times and have my own little strain I bred, I've watched all the documentaries, done plenty of reading, spoken to people and observed what my close friends have gone through, etc. and this is the god honest truth of regular cannabis use.  People in the community are terrified to give even the tiniest bit of ground on this topic because the opposition will take it and run a hundred miles with it and start trying to put people in fucking cages again.  Over the coming years you will see more and more people claiming to have developed a really bad weed habit though.  Its already starting to happen, I'm seeing more and more people pop up with the same experiences I've had.  It does upset me to see people promoting the cannabis lifestyle to people and telling them that its totally non-addictive and you can just smoke it whenever you want with no side effects.  Its just not true.
Have Bradley Martyn on the podcast
oh fuck off about the emotional support dog not being ok to go in restaurants. this is nothing compared to cities banning sledding in the city because kids are getting hurt, someone with a dog in a restaurant is not a big deal, your shoes are probably dirtier than a dogs feet. and all the Politcaly correct bullshit is getting WAAAY out of hand. it needs to end immediately, the libtards are getting worse and worse. and now there is a list of which halloween costumes ppl are allowed to wear and not wear. its fucking ridiculous
When I stop using cannabis for a while my dreams come back really intensely but they're just nightmares so I don't know if I really want that.
hes talkin about beniffets of weed and hes caughin his ass off. his lungs prob look like the inside of a bong.
The red curtains would help with the echo. #soundconditioning
Weed makes me cough, sorry guys...\n\nYou sure are coughing a lot today...
The fucking baller level of Joe Motherfucking Rogan. Not only does he remake his studio, but he slaps on a sauna, gym, indoor archery range, even more, holy shit.
Is it just me or does the new studio look exactly the same as the old one
Joe I don't even know if I have the CW Rogan
why can't we just take a guy at his word anymore. Rogans lying about his weed consumption lol must be fun to assume people are lying about shit all the time.
C'mon Joe, show us the studio. Seriously, take 15 minutes and wander around and show the production area, the archery range, the whozzawhatsis, etc.
Holy shit. You two are complacent in this. Fuck the lawyers. Take this shit to the supreme court.. You've known all this and know these people, yet, you say nothing? Sick shit man.
Women don't wanna be a bitch. -- Could have fooled me.
Joe Kinison had a Bit about that Rogan
Joe is the type of guy to give you advice for 3 hours every time he sees you while he acts like he isn't trying to give you advice.
Hope to see a tour of the new place. Good show.
Great, now we can see Rogan's crusty savaloy TRT skin even more.
Aerosmith getting together with DMC... That is what America is supposed to be - Good enough to be in a frame.
This guys voice is shit
Something about the dark background behind the guest makes it to me almost hard to watch the podcast.
Now that's what they call a chrome dome.\n\nJoe's head is bright as fuck.
I doubt this will be read, however I have to type it. What is up with Fitzdog? He doesn’t stop shaking the whole show. Is he on some kind of medication?\n\nIt didn’t seem to be a major issue, with regards to his mind/responses, but it’s totally noticeable.
You HAVE to listen Corey Feldman’s album, if you haven’t. It’s fucking HILARIOUS
joe needs to get back on the weed
Romancing the Stone is a cult classic 100% And don't forget Danny Devito was hilarious in it 🎥🐒🐒✋
the black curtain alot better then the red... red  just blend in to ppls faces
Great, no more mind numbing stoner talk, well for a little at-least, might start clicking again instead of stumbling upon here in auto play.
Can we get a tour of the new man cave? So we could all be jealous/ inspired
how can we take the philosophic ideas. of a man who cant read, seriously? sounding out words and mispronouncing shit, straight into philosophy
the brick wall is barren
Fuck! When 1:13:50-1:14:10 directly applies to you!\n#fuckImmadrunk
Joe’s man cave
Learn more listening to JRE than any college courses
I stopped pot for 4 months I didnt have any change in my dreams. I agree with it being easy to quit though.
Get a jelly fish tank or an amazing aquarium where the curtains are 👌🏽
The lighting is way too bright and Doctors room soften that light yo!!
i cant wait for the first podcast of nove;ber
Once Joe Rogan talked about getting tougher, UFC zone on for sure.
Joe red pills on the need to stop globalism.  All cultures should be protected.  Don't ruin them by forcing a  square piece through a triangle hole.
What do you mean 'should we legislate behavior'?   All laws are about behavior. The laws against murder are legislating behavior. Speed limits. Taxes. Free speech. 2nd Amendment. It's all legislating behavior in one way or another.\nWe should absolutely legislate the behavior of knowingly infecting someone with HIV and it should absolutely be a felony. It is taking away the choice of the victim. If the person knows their partner has HIV and still decides to have unprotected sexual contact with them, then that is their choice. It's a dumb choice in my opinion, but they are free to make that choice.
Joe perpetuation? that's a weird word Rogan
Why is this guy on so many episodes?
You are having vivid dreams because you're reaching healthier levels of REM sleep now that THC isnt suppressing your sleep cycles. The supplement Glycine helps to counteract this problem and also has a multiplicity of other benefits!
Really Shakey Fitzsimmons?!?.. Dream On is your favorite Aerosmith song??. You need to shuffle thru their catalog again you gapped tooth faggot....Your fuckin opinion sucks and so does your comedy.. Really wished Gorilla boy choked this nervous shaking fucker out after 10 minutes ..
Hypes the new studio for weeks; new studio finally arrives and is just a dimly-lit, more cramped looking version of the last one, boring black curtain + no pictures on wall. Joe, what the fuck you boring old man
put some posters and lights behind joe
Joe I know a guy Rogan
Joe I casually reference Blacked dot com then realized I need to find a way as to why I'm privy to its existence Rogan
Anyone got a link to that Coyote story?
Need to do a tour of the new place
Will we see Sam Harris again soon?
Yeah where is the zeppelin poster ???
Putting  a jalepeno in my food - cultural appropriation, haha
Joe, have you ever heard of VPN? Tell Jamie to look it up while you are on the air.
Voices sound different compared to the old room, tell Jamie to tweak the EQ
disliked because of the support dog stuff.
I need the mug shots behind you. Maybe Justin Beiber this time. And Joe......black civilization predates European civilization for thousands of years. That means that your whole culture is appropriated, especially if you believe that you are different than us.
This set looks like a downgrade...
I came here just to say Greg Fitzsimmons creeps me the fuck out, and I'm a man. Huge mistake to put him back on your podcast, Joe, his last appearance didn't garner many views, nor were his stories of any interest. Why bring him back?
New place looks much better. Lighting is awesome
Fitzimons is the poor man's Bill Burr
Y'all are grown men complaining about curtains and paintings! \nCrybabies!!
where the fuck are the hendrix posters?!!!
Traffic traffic lookin for my chapstick!\nMalibu's most wanted in real life lol
Is Greg having a restless leg thing? Not that it affects the podcast, I just wish I could unsee it.
Unless you are ethnically Italian, you're not allowed to wear a suit or else you are literally committing genocide.
I miss the red curtain :( Also, the mics are picking up something in the background for the entire podcast.
Joe  You are a crazy person Rogan.
dry hole lol dry socket
Everyone knows ur still smoking weed u shit talker
Get andy dick
Joe quits pot.....\nStudio dies.
dopeeee
Two words. Curtains. Red.
Joe Would you bang her? Rogen
THATS NOT YOUR LITTLE RASCALS HAT! Wait shit nice studio
Give us a tour dude
New studio,Ari still pisses in bottle...\n#JRE
Get Bradley Martyn on here ya hardcunt
eeh fruck this jewish podcast
2:27:41
#romancingthestone
11:53 Technical difficulties lol
It'sTrending 😮
Joe “gangsta rap ruins white kids” Rogan
54:20
lol lost it  tom hanks son
NEW STUDIO HYPE
https://soundcloud.com/jazzprincemusic/ex-files-feat-vnny
Fucking cultural appropriation is the stupidest thing ever especially when black ppl try to pull that shit.\nBlack ppl take from other cultures all the time, Italian mafia shit, Colombian cocaine, and Wu Tang Clan?? Gimme a fucking break talkin shit about dreads and cornrows.
2:33:01 Joe when are you going to come out and say you're bi-curious?
Can we please get a tour of the new studio?? and you should try to get cesar millan to help you with your dogs.
Christie Brinkley stays so young from the chuck Norris gizz!
Boooooooorrrrrrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggggg Dave Retire already Paul go get some liposuction done on your fathead night everyone
Please fire Kimmel and bring back this GOAT 🐐😄
Barber: What you want fam?\nLetterman: After i retire i wanna get Ho ho hos\nBarber: I got you fam
Colbert must be pissed that he didn't get the interview
What did David's friend say when David asked him what he should do if a woman tries to touch him? Just Letterman!!! \n\nIm here all night folks!
He is such a grandpa I love it!!
YES!!!! DAVE DAVE DAVE DAVE!....missed him so much, thank you dave for coming back!
Jimmy looks like his favorite uncle is over at the house
Can't stand Kimmel ! Will Always Love David Letterman
Not gonna lie he looks exactly like my grandpa. I'm Indian.
Close your eyes and he sounds exactly the same as he did 20 years ago. Legenddd.
Was never a letterman fan but have you ever heard of that saying never show a better movie in your movie never show a better host in your show
Good to see Dave and Paul together again!
Near at chart judge legend.
Ho ho ho my god that beard is amazingly huge! :D
SANTA IS REAL! He was just disguised as a late night host all these years
Santa Claus, you look good!
So happy Kimmel didn't start crying on this one.
More crap from the Hollywood puppet
Will someone please help my mother get out of debt.?.
Is it me, or does Jimmy Kimmel give off an evil Tobey McGuire, Spider-Man 3, vibe?
Im really enjoying this trend of all the talk hosts referencing each other for some reason
are those your drums?...
Jimmy Kimmel needs to do the guess whats in my pants game he used to do.
David Letterman looks like a compressed George RR Martin
How come Jimmy isn't crying to the nation over Hillary selling uranium to Russia so they can further their nuclear arsenal??
letterman was the GOAT
Oh look two weak minded idiots who are out of touch with reality....neat
He looks like the honorable and illustrious Mayor of Whoville.
About time this show featured a good host.
Oh my, it's Uncle Jesse from Dukes of Hazzard only he's found a suit to wear
Who has a bigger duesh bag beard..Letterman or Zak Wylde
Man he is soooo high
I can only wish I could grow a beard like that!
People really loves him. I thought it was Jim Carrey
Santa should had given a rain deer instead of a horse (“ sub2meeee (=
I am surprise he is still alive.
him and Jim carrey should see which beard is better lol.
David look like he went to the top of the mountain came back speaking the word of god
Celebrities and talk show host are among the most ingenuine , two face and fakest people on earth.
Is there a teleprompter on the ground?
Dave turned from funny and outgoing to old cranky
Get rid of colbert, Fallon and kimmel, bring back letterman, Leno and Kopel. That Kopel was always way more a curate and funnier than kimmel. And waaaay easier on the eyes
Too much white privilege for me.
GOAT.  Is he now the leader of a cult?  Become Amish?  WTF?
Letterman is the best tv host!
Jimmi Kimmi wants you to reach into his pants.
The legend mister letterman miss you man
Bring me Letterman - End the Quote.
Plot twist: What if Conan and David Letterman crafted the horse story together, so that they could have something to talk about in upcoming interviews and play off each other's interview?
They shake hands when they first meet backstage in the studio,  and Jimmy says, 'You know I'm gonna have to say something about the beard, right?'
What is this bs
Neither of these low level hacks will ever be in the  real talk show host  category.
Dave still has it! He's on fire! He and Paul are like their show was on yesterday. No rust!
It's always Good seeing Dave ....you not so much 🌴😀🌴
Get the newest Jimmy Kimmel Lie show.
“He wrote something that was just beautiful. Paul, do you remember that?”\n\n“The thing Conan wrote for you?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“No I don’t remember it.”\n\n😂
I thought this funny and extremely enjoyable.  Both of them are great hosts.  Take care you two.
He looks like my meth dealing uncle in Alabama
jimmy should’ve asked him how mrs clause is
He either looks like a new Santa Claus or the old banker from Mary Poppins.
Looks like Santa has lost weight 🤣
Don't know but Dave seems a little remorseful concerning his retirement
I pray that one of the guests on his show is Norm. It would be a crime if he doesn't get him.
The moral of this interview: Never give up on something you truly love. Even with age, stick with it because someone you think lesser of will take your spot.
I laugh at people who mention the beard.\nMy beard was 2 times that size at the age of 23 (28 now).\nI also laugh at people who can't grow a beard haha!
I would really like to smack him in the face
carson was a real talk show host.
Thank God that fool is retired..
Hey wait a minute - they are pulling our legs, that is Old St. Nick!  lol
Nothing but Love for Dave.
omg santa is real. i knew my parents were lying when they said he was fake
He sits on the porch all day watching squirrels.
Shots fired🔫🔫🔫 4:08
He Santa now.

So.. is anyone gonna talk about the wheelchair
Like Kate Bush, always on it. Great
Fuck my ears with your voice!
Mediocre video for a mediocre song.
The king is back
Oh Moz...you're so old now, and people who know you say you're kind of a cunt...but we still love you.
No More Emasculation!  God it takes a fag to speak out against the emasculation of todays males...😂💯👏
I think this is my theme song. Thanks for the news tip.
Is that joey barton?
Morrissey is not Gay.\nAnd I'm an astronaut that went to Mars and came back alive and well.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
wow he looks so young on tumblr
He's a legend ...
MF'r I forgot how much I love him
It’s all together,great!
very nice track by morrissey.
ROSES ARE RED \n\nMORRISSEY WALKS WITH A STRUT\n\nJOEY BARTON EATING A NUT\n\n2:36
Josef Fritzl for the next video then?
I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia. They are both rape, violence, murder.
yo, get me to 1k and do some crazy shit for you guys, you aint readdddy :0
Oh Shit, I was never a Morrissey fan (not without Johnny Marr) but this is a cool song. Still love Every day is like Sunday.
Spent the day in a pussy
Well, I really wish Joey Barton wasn’t in it. Adds literally nothing to it.
He is my spirit animal
Morrissey is like a god to me. I can't wait for the new album. I can't get this tune out of my head and I don't want it to :)
This is soo good
Brilliant...cannot get this out of my head... So different, quirky, eccentric,,, yes the Master is back! Can't wait for the album to land!
Anyone going to the concert in two months
Brilliant song by Morrissey, but I thought he was against music videos? Not that I didn't expect music videos, I just didn't expect ones so choreographed albeit he's sat in a char half the time..still.
Who did the video? Looks like the work of Chris Cunningham.
Abdullah Khan's human rights have been seriously breached. Please view and share. Thank you.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Abdullah-Khan-has-human-rights-430391800679249/posts_to_page/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU5i5klLQ9o
Is that Joey Barton?
Morrissey isn’t gay\nGay is Morrissey!
*We ''WORK'' our lives away to Pay PROFITS and BONUSES and TAXES and FEES and DOLE so the Top and the Bottom DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING!!*
I was wondering , the other day , What would Morrissey make of the happenings going on in the world today ? This answers my question! Thanks Moz ♥️
Easy for you to say Moz, you're loaded.
Love this song. Lyrics so simple but so true. Peace.
The ending scene when the camera is zoomed in on his face is mildly reminiscent of the end of the Boy Racer video.
Not a fan of his more modern videos, decent song. I think he should get a more creative video director like Anton Corbjin.
Today i dont feel like doing anything, im just gonna lay in my bed
Joey Barton! He'll always be a claret! Legend
My life's dream is to be a Morrissey groupie. Then I can die happy
For a second I thought this was at SubCulture @2:25..
Morrissey, the god of writing & misery <3
This guy has not age. Love him
yes bus, yes boss, yes rain, yes train... but  not by my choice
i'm a young adult now but  feel in the future this will be my jam
This video reminds a bit of Alma Matters, and his shirt reminds me of the one he wore in November Spawned a Monster! Love it.
yes!!! its morrisseys old power again!!!
i dislike it. the song is very easy. and the expression of the words is also. very boring and dull. sorry. morrisey.
Man, I miss the smiths
Why the hell is Joey Barton in this? What's the purpose of it? And I think David Hoyle dancing on the stage, don't suspect many of you know that. I'm trying to figure the point of it all.. A wheelchair... a bed.... an old social club. Morrissey looking like a smug twat. Barton looking like a smug nonce eating peanuts. It's total nonsense.
Pretentious boring drivel from a miserable fool.
Cool Music!
#47 on trending? Shit.
Well Done, My Love.
straight trash
Happy
wow sooo beautiful
Beautiful
Thumbs up, Thanks!
Awesome

Breathing in the dark\nLying on its side\nThe ruins of the day\nPainted with a scar\nAnd the more I straighten out\nThe less it wants to try\nThe feelings start to rot\nOne wink at a time\n\nOh\nForgiving who you are\nFor what you stand to gain\nJust know that if you hide\nIt doesn't go away\nWhen you get out of bed\nDon't end up stranded\nHorrified with each stone\nOn the stage\nMy little dark age\n\nPicking through the cards\nKnowing what's nearby\nThe carvings on the face\nSay they find it hard\nAnd the engine's failed again\nAll limits of disguise\nThe humor's not the same\nComing from denial\n\nOh\nI grieve in stereo\nThe stereo sounds strange\nI know that if you hide\nIt doesn't go away\nIf you get out of bed\nAnd find me standing all alone\nOpen-eyed\nBurn the page\nMy little dark age\n\nI grieve in stereo\nThe stereo sounds strange\nYou know that if it hides\nIt doesn't go away\nIf I get out of bed\nYou'll see me standing all alone\nHorrified\nOn the stage\nMy little dark age\n\nGiddy with delight\nSeeing what's to come\nThe image of the dead\nDead ends in my mind\n\nPolicemen swear to god\nLove's seeping from the guns\nI know my friends and I\nWould probably turn and run\nIf you get out of bed\nCome find us heading for the bridge\nBring a stone\nAll the rage\nMy little dark age\n\nI grieve in stereo\nThe stereo sounds strange\nI know that if you hide\nIt doesn't go away\nIf you get out of bed\nAnd find me standing all alone\nOpen-eyed\nBurn the page\nMy little dark age\n\nAll alone\nOpen-eyed\nBurn the page\nMy little dark age
I can picture this being used really well in. AHS episode/trailer
This sounds SO SO familiar\nSites anyone else recognise it
basically the cure love cats
Man, about time.  Thank you.
This reminds me of depeche mode
WHAT ARE YOU GUNA BE FOR Halloween?
Wow, this is an AWESOME comeback! ♥\nSo glad they're doing music again! ♥
this is fucking great!!
This song, out of nowhere 🙂\nMakes me feel like a bobble head when listening to it
Since when did Robert Smith start singing for MGMT?!?!?!?
Hats off to MGMT...what a great song! Love the Robert Smith Hair!! I hope and pray unique music like this makes a come back soon!
Nostalgicness is hitting me who else
3:05 thought that was aubrey plaza for a sec
i still can't get over how connan moccasin is in this,,,, definitely my new fav song now
The whip and stare at 3:35, made me laugh. But yea the rest is meh. Cure hair
OMG, new song, I dreaming, it's not true. I dream, is this. Good night, I'm wake up and say for yours
MGMT I love you and i missed you!!! 😭😲💓
The new cure or what?
If The Cure and Human League had a baby band
Was checking to see if you had new music, excited for your return
Thought these fuckers gave up already. Good for them
He's finally mutated into that faggot from The Cure ...
It reminds me when I listened to MCR and other emo bands 24/7 on elementary school
DID THAT MAGICIAN JUST SPLIT THAT DOVE IN TWO
Just a long time fan, here, l love the new song <3 just wish I could see y'all in New Orleans over Halloween weekend Dx
I just need to find Lucy now.
hey, that's pretty good!
Jesus Christ I thought this was the ninja turtles site
Dude, so good!  You guys killed it on this one!
90's Goth imagery is strong with the MGMT....\n\n\n\n\n80's Robert Smith clone singing?
I fucking love this . Gives me The Cure vibes ❤️❤️
Ok who went into Robert Smith's wardrobe?
Fifa 19, I called it
Just in time for Halloween!
show yourself take only what you need from me
Robert Smith's lost son
such a nice comeback ❤❤❤ love it
Nothing better than listening to Goth music in a pitch black room at midnight! :D
makes me think a little bit of the video Invisible Light by Scissor Sisters
Goth hipsters are a thing. I have now seen everything.
i like the sega genesis vibe.
Excellent. Hope they can keep the momentum for the entire album.
Back in 2008 when everything was emo they were hipsters, now eveyone is hipster and they're emos. Inception.
Wow the cure looks very cool now on day
Can anyone explain the meaning of the video?
The dark side of MGMT
Nothing makes me move like an mgmt song! Can't get over this. I listened to it like at least 50 times already
I can't stop replaying this song
Incredible that a really awesome song ,with 80's vibe but creative as hell Is now on Tendencies , It's like  the 80's comeback. i just found it and loved it 💙💜
i already like this song more than their self titled album

Would be much better with Hans Zimmer interstellar soundtrack for sure.
If we where gonna die the burst would have been toward us , we wouldn't have been able to see the stripes
Who thought this was about that strange orange glow in england a couple days ago
since the two black holes last year, lost a significant amount of mass, due to producing so huge an amount of gravity wave distortion universe wide. several solar masses of energy was lost. the question, and I may have to figure it out myself, is, how much mass, over this length of time, 200 miles wide, was lost here. this would reduce the equation of state, because the end result may be much less than the 2.1 solar mass neutron star already seen.
Fire at will
Completely inaccurate depiction

gravitational waves were first predicted by Professor Albert Einstein.
So wtf happens now?
While most people worry about where the heavy elements originate from, relativity is no longer just a theory. It is now observed. We have many observations of time dilation due to gravity and now we can confirm having observed distance dilation due to gravity and only just now having been validated by the visible light of a kilanova. Relativity is here to stay. It's not just a theory anymore. Relativity is science fact.\n\nEnquanto a maioria das pessoas se preocupa de onde os elementos pesados ​​se originam, a relatividade não é mais apenas uma teoria. Agora é observado. Temos muitas observações de dilatação do tempo devido à gravidade e agora podemos confirmar ter observado a dilatação da distância devido à gravidade e apenas agora já foi validado pela luz visível de um kilanova. A relatividade está aqui para ficar. Não é mais uma teoria. A relatividade é um fato científico.
That is fantasmigorical
Ooooohhhhhhh why couldn't it be longer.?  Great stuff\nWhat happens to the neutron stars?
in death we are most beautiful
Wake up SHEEPLE. The Earth is flat. There's no such thing as stars or gravity.
They should have got Zack Snyder to direct this and Hans Zimmer to score it.
amazing sounds from space . just like a song
This video and description was much more entertaining than any so called news about Harvey Weinstein...

es-ce que la musique est celle que la fusion fait ?
Can someone explain to me how they just happened to find this when it's 130 million light years away? 130 million light years means it happened 130 million years ago. So they just got super super ultra ridiculously unbelievable unfathomably rarely lucky to find this event that took an earth week to happen but occurred 130 million years ago 130 million light years away and NASA just so happened to have multiple instruments all pointed at the exact same event even though they did not the know about what it was until after they got the radiation and light measurements. Can anyone explain that?
and there is that guy \nwho still believes that the earth is flat
Liers
I don't believe gravitation waves travel at the speed of light... If they did the entire mass of the universe would be in constant collapse right after the big bang but studies prove this isn't the case...
*is there anything more beautiful in the world than this?*
Just another nuclear bomb testing in north korea...
Shitty video. Quartz did a better ome on the subject lol
Why are people so excited over this speculative simulation. Relax it is not real.
Ain't no doomed neutron stars cos ain't no universe cos ain't no globe Earth.\n\nCome at me globalists.
This has been reported several times and we are into the second wave now.. each wave of energy is thousands of times stronger than the last. Space weather is directly responsible for the earth pains.. Not man made global warming...Ask yourself, why did all the tarmacs and runways change there . Coordinates magnetic north has changed several years ago when you look at a fixed Compass it is a half hour off around the world our Earth is tilting on its axis these things are happening due to space weather and possibly an incoming binary star possibly a lot more things that are going on than you think they do not report on many things
I recall Brian Cox  theorising that the energy produced from this collision will scorch the earth, and that’s how the world will end
I saw this live, was crazy.
No coments saying this is about god?
Space is amazing
Imagine if NASA had the Military budget... the things they could do!
Song ?
It’s pretty cool we got a talk from the people who detected it a week before
NASA is my space station
Have we entered a new era? An era of light and gravitational waves... An era of neutrons stars. Something we can now see that we couldn't detect before
Wow, I never realised we could get cameras that close to stars, wonder how they found them, really lucky
Is this what people see after taking drugs 😂
Question, Animation shows each neutron star releasing gravitational ways before the merger, how is this possible? Aren't gravitational waves only released after the merger? Due to all that mass collapsing onto itself? @NASA
The earth is rectangle.
Is maths related to science?
People. I am not a whack job. I am a very reasonable, sensible, logical person hiding his identity from the people who do not like reality.\n\nI can blow the bubble you live in. My videos will wake you up and provide you the true world.\n\nThe question is: Do you really want to know?
What a load of rubbish. Science FICTION
Was very pretty now what is actually going on????
Science is a social construct. God is the creator.
Fuck athiests
Hey  viewers  watch  thunderbolts  project  ,on you tube , called  impossible  neutron star . This vid gives a different perspective .  Problems  arise  when theorists  assert  their  observation  instead  of  presenting  it  as  a  possible  answer.

Is this a trailer for Sonic Mania? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njk im not dumb
In the UK, the entirety of the BBC knew about Jimmy Saville being a pedo, but did nothing about it and let it continue because they didn't want to rock the boat. In Churches, pedophile priests were moved from diocese to diocese everytime the locals became aware of their perversions, and the best one to move them was Ratzinger, later Pope John Paul II. Everyone knew it was happening and even joked about it, but no-one did anything. In London, the British Parliament under Maggie Thatcher were practically spilling over with pedophiles and perverts, and the entire Parliament knew about it, but it was bad for your career to stand up so no-one did.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but when you have positions of power, people with incredibly evil predatory ambitions will seek those positions out to get access to what the normal public cant. That will always happen. But it's too sick and wrong that people who are normal, WILL NOT SPEAK UP WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. Like fuck me who cares if you have to take a regular 9-5 office job after, you stopped some poor kid (including young adults) from being taken advantage of! Speak up and speak out. The whole damn place is rotten to the core with people who kept silent and knew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldK9qvRBkMI
The academy are a bunch of weasels themselves. There are stories coming out that this Jabba the hut looking mofo has been doing this for years and people knew of it I'm sure the academy knew too. They only say that statement now to cover their asses, there are probably more people like Weinstein in the academy as well.
John Oliver is a traitorous piece of talentless crap. He can only read from a Teleprompter, not even his words, the words are put there by his masters
And his victims didn’t speak out to “protect their careers” but are now coming out in droves and are called heroes. Shame on you ALL Hollywood
I really love how John Oliver only spent 2 minutes on this. While in literally EVERY ONE OF HIS SHOWS he manages to spend 10-20 minutes on Donald Trump alone. EVERY SHOW! Stop pushing your democratic agenda you fuck.
Uh, she is the only honest one. Women will do anything to gain power or money. You dumbasses. Women aren't victims of anything. Why not just walk around topless. Let me know how that goes. Grab em by the pussy. If it was a rock star or NFL player who said that than they would wish it to be true.
I love who you people try to act like your shocked by this.\nYou fuckers have known about his behaviour for years.\nYet because you have a troll shielding mentality, you just swept it under the fucking rug.\nFucking disgusting.
Donna Karen is a foo.
i blame women, ya say you want an assertive man that knows what he wants and takes it, but when we do you wanna scream sexual assault, smh
Why am I not 50 points ahead she screams.  Because you are BFF with Harvey Weinstein.
Lol using TMZ as a a source
Wow Hollywood actors are hypocritical!? I wonder if there was a constituency whose been saying this for years!
Fake news. Multimillionaire limousine liberals are perfect and above the law.
Are you a dumbass John? Of course it matters how woman dress dumbass.
15 minutes on Equifax, 2 minutes on the unraveling of Hollywood. Some might correctly point out that you're minimizing this story, you fucking hack.
she looks like F Murray Abraham in drag
Donna Karen is right and wrong!
Weiner and Weinstein two perverted pedophiles with weiners that can't keep it in their pants.
♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God & promises you eternal life if you simply believe Him.*\n*He promised to also heal your body.   (Just ask Him)*
I take it none of them got the part they were promised? They all do this your fav celebs engage in these activities.
Harvey is one of the king Jews in Hollywood and if you cross the jews in Hollywood you do not work.
John Oliver had to suck Weinsteins dick once.
Hey John.....I don't think that women that frees sexy are inviting sexual harassment- but - women that play along as long as it gets them the role they want are enabling it....and many women did - apparently......til they saw more dollar signs in finally coming out against him.   He's a pig - not doubt ...but the women that went along with it were Hollywood whores.
Yes, amillion accusations the moment the story hits... Hmm, funny.
donna karen should choke on her spit.
New Weinstein Halloween costume....just masterbate into a planter.
(((Harvey Weinstein)))
Classic Harvey...
hes a frickin pig
I think most of the elites in hollywood are doing that kind of shit! When theres one there is usualy many. How many actresses had to suck dick to get a place on a movie ? Nuke america its a rotten country
Harvey is my hero..he fucked more hollywood celebrities than anyone alive.
I am sure this crook presenter didn't know about it also..
i doubt anything will happen \nHollywood will protect him media will protect him\nit will be swept under the table and forgotten about in a month
Just stick him in a box with hyenas and be done with it.
Lets get to the kids that they rape - enough with this distraction
Donna Karan \nThat's a dude...playing a chick
no W in that language.\nVfinestine
What does Mel Gibson have to do with it?
She's  probably taken it back since.
People are just not defending him because his story blew up- what about the other actors/actresses?
Donna looks like sporty spice if she was 100 and still dying her hair.
They are all druggies, pedophiles, and rapists. Come on people are you really that blind. Don't act like they aren't all doing this kind of shit. Every time an actor dies they are all dying due to drug overdose. Wake up people, quit using these people as a means of political insight and think for yourselves.
It's sad that anything with a late night shows host's name gets trending instantly.
RIP due process. Everyone is tried in the media now, and a whole slew of sheep cheer it on. . Yes, he probably did it, but I choose the rule of law over moral superiority. He should not have been fired until he was convicted. Ironic that the same Hollywood scum that knowingly covered it up are now leaping to condemn, and I include the mindless outrage junkies in the comments
I had to Google Donna Karan to find out who in the hell that is!
Hey Harvey the man! He praised Bill for amazing things, he taught him  https://youtu.be/cTo8nGXz2Yw
People. I am not a whack job. I am a very reasonable, sensible, logical person hiding his identity from the people who do not like reality.\n\nI can blow the bubble you live in. My videos will wake you up and provide you the true world.\n\nThe question is: Do you really want to know?
Thats Liberals for you John.
Seriously..  Harvey says he's still going to make movies after all this. What a scum bag. People need to boycott anything associated with Weinstein. Money is the only thing that talks in Hollywood. #BoycottHarvey
Does Donna Karen know she doesn’t have to smile at the end of every sentence?
I understand that, to Americans, John Oliver might seem charming in an eloquent Jewish Mr Bean kind of way, but he hadn't even been particularly popular, or heavily known, in the UK when he moved to America. He was a nerd here. Not even a particularly clever seeming one (considering that he went to Cambridge University), just the kind of guy who pokes fun in order to be popular.
One day I'll be the top comment.
This is standard practice across all levels of power, if you think Weinstein is the last you couldn't be more wrong!
Bullshit you can tell this bitches are lying, so many smiles at the end of each sentence. And people eat this shit up with no proof.
Kudos to John for not injecting Trump into this as so many on the left have tried.\n\nAlso yeah, the fact they get rid of Harvey, but people like Roman Polanski are still members of the academy makes no sense.\n\nMeryl Streep, famous for talking smack about Trump during an acceptance speech, flat out gave Polanski a standing ovation(she was not the only one to do so).  This was LONG after we knew what he'd done.\n\nHollywood is utter trash and sadly the left is trying to spin this to not make it specifically about Hollywood, but about sexual harassment at the work place in general.
Now everyone claims they knew it bunch of retards
Is there any chance donna karan has indian roots??!!
Just like liberals making light of criminals and making fun of the women perpetrated  nice !
What else do you expect from a degenerate kike
People are free to dress however they want but that means taking what comes with it. Harvey Weinstein is pretty trash though...
I guess Harvey raped this british guy too
These are the same hollywood people that preached their purity and gave millions and their support to the Hillary campaign now you see why she got her ass kicked after spending one point two billion dollars with the internet the American can fact check the fake news networks and talk show shills RIP democratic party
You know, opinions are just like arseholes, everyone has one! The comments from Trumpets on this page is amazing. They are in their tiny little element oh he isn't talking about our great orange twisler...why the fuck do you substandard, unbalanced weirdos watch? It's satire you morons! And you know who write the content? I'ok give you a min,  while you answer your microwave!
All the virtue signalling celebs an lefties, ha ha ha. Shit is coming home to roost now.
Oh wow liberal elites colluding and protecting their own until it becomes uncool?  Well imagine my shock.  As if pompous shitstains like Oliver didn't know about stuff like this as well.  He was on the DNC payroll during the election and took talking points from them, I don't trust him as far as I could throw him.
Normally when you are sexually assulted you call the police.   An investigation happens etc.  These women could and didn't call the police and instead took huge movie roles that paid lots of money. No victims here unless you are the last girl who did blow the whistle.  I don't feel bad for any of them.  When you sell your soul to the devil you don't get to complain about eternity in hell.
Hugh Hefner has been acting in this same manner since the 50's... Nobody throws stones at him... Why..?? Hefner and Weinstein are the same person. They both used women, exploited them and demeaned them to make boatloads of money... Let's end the hypocrisy..!! 95% of Hollywood production is just pornography, dressed up with lipstick.
Stephen this sucks dong please make more comedy
Whores are done with weinstein. They are no longer able to used him to advance in career any more. Whores are looking for a new hollywood boss. Who is the next whores' master?
Weinstein and Karan are cousins , she's defending her blood , that's what happened..
He has sex addicting in Hollywood that's tough but you can't just slander the guy's name without proof and if you didn't report it you didn't care to much about it
Odd that they attack Mel Gibson at the end, the only story of him being less than a gentleman was from his mail order bride that was probably trying to extort money. I can't prove it, but he's very religious and usually very nice. Cosby and Weinstein were prolific rapists and Polanski had sex with a minor (whether it was consensual was disputed, but she was under age.)
Donna makes it clear that some women in the industry welcomed this rapey behavior with open arms because it happens to be their fetish. What we see in the scandal are the women who don't accept this behaviour, especially from that fat ugly fuck. Starting from today there will be no more people like Harvey and I'm sure some women will hate that.
Thank you John sorry that this probably happened to you as well
Maybe it's cause I was born in 1993, but seriously:\nWHO TF IS DONNA KARAN AND WHY DOES HER OPINION \nMEAN ANYTHING REGARDLESS OF THE SUBJECT? xD
That’s Hollywood for ya. Been like that since the golden age of films
Just the sound of this smug pricks voice makes me want to kick his face in
Hay Hollywood creep can you tie it in to Russia or the president?
What if (bear with me) you were stuck in the wilderness being held hostage (bear with me) by an animal, and  could only ( *bear with me* ) communicate for help by putting hidden messages in comments?
Lol so this huge democratic $ is what they portray trump as ahahahahahah

Did Casey Affleck do something wrong?
Practically all of Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein and his disgust acts, yet nobody did anything to stop him. \n\nIt just goes to show that Hollywood is corrupt liberal shithole.
Here before 1 million Like or sub If You are or agree?!😀
What did casey affleck do? Not doubting it just curious
Oliver is a hack that swallowed Weinstein's jizz to get this shitty show.
As John probably knows it was the same here in the UK with Jimmy Savile, people knew but did nothing about it, for purely selfish reasons of self preservation
it is just rape, not a big deal.
Of course what the perpetually cuckolded unfunny prick fails to admit is that these degenerate overpaid scumbags are drinking from the same ideological Liberal trough that he is!
Donna Karen, really? .......Casey Affleck....HAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!
Pirated video on trending, yes
Must be embarrassing for the liberals to have to OUT one of their own.
When isn't Oliver Stone saying something stupid or controversial
He is now taking cocks up his ass welcome to 21st century
if her mother was part jewish' and her maiden name was benjamin, likely his father was jewish, so she is not *really* jewish. Neither is her son.
Well that changed quickly then

Well let's hope others follow in his footsteps.
The man's whole life is a lie. So can you really believe him. Homosexuals are mentally ill people who are perverse  and whose whole life is based on the destruction of Christian white patriarchal civilisation. Not nice people and a jew. Senior lawyers in the legal profession are Jew's and I think you will find the biggest percentage are closet homosexuals. Hence parliament repealing the homosexuals laws
Nazism: Treats other religious groups like dirt, persecutes ethnic minorities, and persecutes Homosexuals and people with liberal beliefs.\nIslam: Treats other religious groups like dirt, persecutes ethnic minorities, and persecutes Homosexuals and people with liberal beliefs.
round up all the open skin heads world wide and lets just put THEM in concentration camps and gas THEM
This is why our movement is a fucking joke, pretty much every white nationalist i have seen or met is very uneducated and has the physical build of a pre-pubescent 12 year old. If your truly a proud white man train your body and mind and prepare for any scenario, quit walking around weighing 130 lbs claiming your part of the master race.
How the hell is this on trending let alone YouTube
faith in humanity has been restored a bit from this news hopefully this will be a wake up call to the other sheep following aholes around who just want to cause harm to tohers.
totally not a plant
Control both sides.\nThat's why Jews win.
Sad, another one of my best goes back to their old life
Jesus Christ- I worry for these peoples mental health who are part of these groups.
Story sounds about as real as a £9 note
He said 6billion being killed bruh, million not billion
The mad thing is I don't see why if their national front and all for England want to share the same views as a group of people who opposed England in ww2 (nazis) bit stupid really mate come on
No sympathy whatsoever. Jews and the LGBT community need to shun this a-hole so he dies alone and unhappy.
As much as I think this guy is retarded, credit where credit is due. At least he came to his sense in the end
Gay, Jewish neo nazi? You know this fools ancestors was giving him a stink *side eye* while others were like what chu talking bout Willis. If that was not some fuckery to the 9th power, what in thee entire fuck?? I would say black Jesus take the wheel, but his liscense is suspended.
Communism resulted in more deaths than any other political system in the last 100 years. \nCultural marxism has created ridiculous far left groups and given a voice to the usual eternal 'victims' who carry a chip on their shoulder. The increase in popularity of the so called 'alt right' was a direct result of the far left and their affirmative action.
What is exactly a neo nazi? He is British, wasn’t the British against nazi?!?
Hitler was part jewish and didnt have blonde hair or blue eyes, weird how these peoples minds work
Jewish Neo-Nazi man, those first two words are mutually exclusive, it's a juxtaposition surely
These people are so full of self hate!
Not all Jews are smart.
The jews are the real nazis. Hitler was the most lied about man in history. Every one talks about the holocaust(Even tho there is no proof of the exact number of people killed) but yet they dont talk about what churchill did to india or what the zionist jews have done though out history. All these muslim attacks,The death of european culture,Lgbt agenda and world poverty is all because of the zionist jews. The zionist jews fund groups like kkk,Blm,Antifa so that they can cause war. Id rather live in nazi germany than what england has become right now.
All hate will eventually die out and all we will have left is love and each other
This is the worst possible time to admit this...trump is president...anything could happen to this guy....he will need a body guard. ...i hope he has the cash for one.
i can't even imagine how awfull person you need to be to do anything like that - what a fucking punk. being gay and jewish himself, joining criminal nazi organisation. often destroying people's lifes. and now, after all these years he's feeling guilty? yeah, you are fucking guilty. coward. and scumbag.
Cant stop the rise of the right. Try harder channel 4.
Neo nazis are Hollywood stereotypes...I'm a white nationalist and have not met a Neo nazi since 1980s in England...they are low IQ punks who wanted to be edgy.\nWhite nationalists however have no hatred towards any race. If anything we hate the white liberal Leftys for turning OUR ancestral homelands into multicultural dystopias. EVERY people deserve to remain the overwhelming majority of their homelands...and yes, that includes us Europeans! If having these views make me a RACIST NAZI then so be it! \nWE BUILT THE WESTERN WORLD AND ONLY US CAN MAINTAIN THE WEST...DEMOGRAPHICS IS DESTINY!
jew is not heritage. That's a religion.
One down, a few million worldwide to go
Neo-Nazis are messed up people, that's why most right wingers and conservatives want nothing to do with them
Dammit, I can't wait to play wolfenstien 2.

I thought you'd see this shit only in memes wtf
For the love of cliché, this is glorious!
I wonder if he was a government agent...
mohammed hates gays and jew's. He was in the SS. but i don't think hes going to be like this fag
Someone has blackmailed him, without question.\nI don't think someone so far gone can return to normal thought.
White people especially english people act so hard but they are literally all a bunch of gay faggots, gay loving fags
Not surprised. Hitler was Jewish, from Austria and probably gay too.
Meanwhile the Muslims are attacking Jews all over Europe forcing them to migrate back to Israel
Nice try Channel 4. Whoever made this obvious propaganda film should be fired, at least try to make it subtle next time.
Very insightful interview. Brave man, hopefully many young ones can get themselves out of that terrible environment.
This sort of insight into far-right ideology is very important if we want to tackle it and make people realize how wrong they are.
We live in a world where anyone further to the right than an open communist is a far-right nazi. Madness. Gullible fools every fucking where. Pat your selves on the back people.
I was actually a very interesting 11 minutes
?why is a vid with 20k veiws in the top ten trending? youtube machine broke
Neo Nazism is just trying to be tough that's why it's mostly young men. Insecure with a desperate point to prove.
The part about him being lonely made me sad. The liberal community should welcome this guy with open arms; he'd be a really valuable ally in bridging some sort of gap.
Have to be a right thick cunt to pick the team that bombed your parents, dumb fuck. All Nazis are paedos, none of them should be allowed to breed.
Father beat him.  He turns out homosexual.  Not surprising.  Homosexuality, more often than not, is linked to father problems.
When are you mentioning Nadia chan channel4? Your bigot extremist. Rather hear about that  than another sensationalist video title

What a sad little cunt he was. Dressing up like a traitor. But I can't help thinking this is all pretty tame when compared with the present Labour leadership. And who they like to hang out with.
That's a lot of dislikes, but why? Why are the Nazis hiding?
Fake story perpetrated by a government under-cover actor who's reached the end of his operation and needs to leave without question.
Still looking for Nazi's you commie lefties. Things must be looking bleak for you if your bringing shit up from the 80s, you do realise your commie shaming doesn't work anymore right. We wont be bowed down from who we are an this country just so you can get your commie wet dream of the EUSSR. An this is all that it is is you lefties trying to shame people of being who we are, well that shite doesn't cut it anymore.
never heard of this kike, looks like tim wise lmao. low effort
Wake up white people
homophobic? too bad these newsgroups support something just as bad as Hitler.
RIP europe

Duh, all Nazis are gay.

Fake and Gay
Who call themselves nazis neo-nazis etc are just fucking retarded. The german nazi party in the '30s/'40s was not about hate. These guys are all about hating everyone who's not a so-called nazi. Shame. Being on the right side is completely different. Having pride is not the same as being a nazi, even if they say so.
What a complete fake this guy is, there is no way on earth he was an awakened European man and then revert back to saying 6 million Jews were killed, that figure has been proven to be a propagandist lie for decades. A genuine man could decide he no longer wanted to be part of the National Front for whatever reason but to revert back to saying the international clique are victims is complete bullshit! You don’t have to be part of a Neo-Nazi organization to know that the victors write the history books and that a powerful Jewish elite controls the western world through the banking system, governments, political groups, the educational system and Msm. It was such a (((Hollywood))) style interview with the dramatic packing up of National Socialist memorabilia, it made me chortle. This guy is an obvious infiltrator and I hope he meets up with his ex comrades again soon.
Many Zionists Jews were Nazis, seriously. And far as the homosexuals, i wouldn't hold it against many of the ancient greek philosophers for being homosexuals. That being said, homosexuality shouldn't be so fetishistic in a society like we see today where everything revolves around sex and degeneracy.
I don't find any of this surprising at all. People hate what they see in themselves that they find uncomfortable or scary. A guy I grew up with and was good friends with got heavy into the alt-right stuff, and he got drunk at admitted to me and another friend that he 'sometimes' watched gay porn and hated himself for it, and that it was a sin, and that it wasn't something that he should accept. And he said that he hated black people and jews' even though he 'knew it didn't make any sense.' He said he had a lot of Jewish heritage on one side of the family. \n\nI feel bad for people that can't live their truth, or be their authentic selves. I'm not saying every single person that is homophobic is gay, or every single person that hates another group of people has something deeper going on, but I sort of think that most do.
I just don't understand why neo-Nazism is allowed? I mean, dosen't it mean a party that is similar to the Nazi party? How can that be legal?
Fuck your ex your tummy is prefect.
Riyadh is so handsome and Hannah is so classy xxx
My eyes are red. It's a mutation. My retina doesn't reflect back any color but red tones. And people get freaked out by them.
Are you 2 for real??? You are what's wrong with the world, snowflakes bitching about fuckall.you ain't making people feel better.i just want to smash your heads together.god dam,some people make me sick.
Had a blast watching this One! Thanks!
Why the fuck is this trending this is a waist of trending space
Really wonderful video that will impact anyone, as we all have our insecurities. But, I have to say, the comment about being able to look in a mirror and always being able to see your Dad...that was a really beautiful thing to say!
Don't worry everyone has insecurities. Mine is well large LOL. I'm a real heavy-set guy and I was bullied a lot because of it and well I developed a very big insecurity plus it doesn't help much when my doctor says then I'm going to die of diabetes pretty soon just because I'm big. Funny right?
I have a condition called Pectus Carinatum, aka pigeon chest, and because of that I always hated my body. I was always skinny - which made my chest even more proeminent. This issue made me never get shirtless in public and even have some back problems as I was constantly trying to hide this proeminent chest. I would just get in a swimming pool wearing a t-shirt and this made be so so uncomfortable. My parents and friends would always ask me things about my body and this only made the situation get worse. I never talked to anyone about this, as in my mind everything was so obvious. In my mind, everyone was starring at me and thinking how weird it looked.  I got to a point that I would refuse going out with my friends because I knew they would go to a swimming pool and they would pressure me to get shirtless. Urgh, awful times.\n\nAs the years passed, I got more mature and stopped worrying so much. I realised that everyone feels insecure about their body, even the ones that we look up to. Besides, my condition is not that bad. My chest is just a little proeminent. However, because I thought about this so much, everything in my mind was so much worse than it actually was. Nowadays, I regret not being myself and skipping so much fun I woud have. I still don't post pictures with my top off, but now I totally accept who I am and I feel it only gets better. :)
oh i have the nose veins too... i hate it.  my grandfather had them and thought the same thing. Then the doctor tells stop drinking that will help stop progress. like really... so understand your insecurity.
getting it off your chest
Irish boy with perfect muscles, perfect teeth, perfect jawline etc: “I have body insecurities”\nMe without all the above: “Well fuck me, I might as well kill myself”
You two young folks have nothing to worry about. My pal Ben once went out with a girl, who got on top of him as they had sex. When asleep and alone, later that night, he likely had a nightmare that centred on Africa, particularly on vast elephant ears, if you get my meaning. OK, nobody's perfect, but Jesus, I HATE those !
Dear Hannah,\nI have had a breast reduction/breast lift and it CHANGED MY LIFE.\nI went to see this top-notch specialist in Paris and she did an a-ma-zing job. \nI would definitely recommend it! \nXx
Just have to say I love your nose. It’s like my fav feature of your very handsome face.
I didn't knew the boobs thing! Oh dear :O\nI'm like him, i like nipple stimulation <3

I think quite a powerful perception is the fact that, both of you are genuinely nice people and your viewers really like you. With that, they will only see how beautiful you both are and will celebrate how you physically look.
My main insecurities are my acne (had it since I was 9 I'm now 19) and my stomach and thighs
Ah ye're both beautiful ye big rides xxx
I have a thing about noses and yours is grand.
Its so crazy to watch this since you bith are the two sexiest youtubers i subscribed to :D
I would be insecure abt the washing up in the bg of this video 😂
my insecurity is my boobs, but for the opposite reason to hannah. i'm a very tall woman, 511 1/2 to be exact, with wide hips, but i feel like my boobs are so small for my size. i feel really imbalanced because my hips are so curvy but i have no cleavage up the top. it's silly really, as my cup size is fairly average (36C), but i feel like they look even smaller because of my larger frame. \n\none previous insecurity that i've now grown to love are my stretchmarks. i have them everywhere, my hips, my boobs, my back, my calves, my bum, my thighs, my knees, you name it, i've probably got stretchmarks there. but, like riyadh with his nose, i feel like they give me character, and i like to think that they show how much i've grown and changed as a person. \n\nthis was such an interesting video! thank you both for opening up and sharing with us :)
I genuinely think Riyadh's nose makes him more attractive...
Ears are apart of your face/head n they're all meant to stick out a little it helps shape your head n face. You look so gorgeous and pretty with your hair slightly back to show your cute ears. Believe it.
you two are cute
Why is he talking like that?
I quit biting my nails by realising what it was doing to my teeth. I read later that if you want to get rid of a habit, you need to replace the habit with something else. I chose to look after my teeth and my nail biting habit(of 20+ years) couldn't exist in symbiosis :)
I completely understand what Hannah said after talking about her teeth . It's okey to change parts of your body if you don't feel good about them, but when you change them because you're pressured by society's beauty standard it just adds to the huge problem we have now a days with companies exploiting insecurities that they create. Loved the video by the way!
Litereally everyone has those roles, that's like saying you're insecure about having feet.
Your nose is great! Never change!
I had the same realisation as Riyadh about my nose too. All my life I hated how big and round it was, but after my granny (Who had an identical nose to me) died I started to appreciate that it was the thing that made me resemble her, and that made me love it. My dad has the same nose too, so it now makes me happier to think that we all share this trait together.
Also, Riyadh's nose is one of the most attractive things about him (in my opinion)!
i love you guys!<3
I have what's known as gynecomastia which is the growth of breast tissue in men, a.k.a. man boobs.  They grew when I was going through my puberty.  I was bullied for having man boobs by multiple people throughout my school days.  I would always wear clothes that wouldn't show them too much in an attempt to hide them and, even though I'm less conscious of them now, at the age of 24 I'm still insecure about them to the point that, for example, going swimming is a no-no.  I've always been a bigger than average guy however I've lost a significant amount of weight this year and they have gotten smaller but they'll always be bigger than that of an average guy unless I get surgery.
THIS VIDEO WAS EVERYTHING!!! LOVED IT
If this guy thinks having short bitten fingernails is a reason to be insecure..he wouldn't dig stretch marks like I've got lol wanna trade?
Great video guys..really fantastic and you guys are gorgeous.\n\nAlso I want to say lets all be careful of what we say to our significant others...some things can be really damaging
I was bullied for my freckles, because they are all along my nose and under my eyes, i used to cover them up when i would go to school, take pictures or just generally go out i didn't feel that they were a problem until someone said something about it, it just shows how people can affect you. You guys are so brave.<3
Kiss Me You Fool IS THIS A LARRY STYLINSON REFERENCE RIYADH?!?!?!?!?!??! HELLL YEEEEEEA BOI
Riyadh's videos make me so so so happy
For me it's the same for my nose cause I don't really like it and I thought of changing it but it's the same of my grandpa and he is not here anymore so it's something that I have of him
This was such a great video :) \nI’m really struggling with my teeth too, I hate how they look and how they look in pictures and I’m recently engaged and panicking about my wedding photos! \nEveryone else has told me that they’re fine and look good but I just cannot get passed it! I’ve been to an orthodontist to get advice and they have offered Invisalign but omg is it expensive! I’m looking to go ahead with it in November but I feel SO GUILTY about spending so much on a cosmetic procedure because I could do so much more with the money. 😭 it feels like such a vain thing.\nHaving a crisis of the mind.
This was amazing. Thank you so much for being open and honest. It’s so refreshing to hear this kind of dialogue. You’re both absolutely beautiful.
Riyadh is such a sweet cinnamon roll.\nlmao at his reaction to Hannah whacking her boobs...
yeah I have a little Rosacea near my nose that I inherited from my dad.. I'm really self conscious about it as well but nobody ever notices it but me..
You know nothing of insecurities :(
Riyadh, not that you need it, but those threadveins can be treated and removed with intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments! Most cosmetic dermatologists do the treatment.
My insecurity was how big my butt  was when I was going through puberty. I'm 23 now and I've excepted it for what is. To give you a reference my waist is 28 inches my butt is 42 inches , I would wear coats and jackets all year round to hide my shape from people in grade school. Now at this age my body type is desired and front in the media.
And may I add that your picture for attitude magazine are the hottest/most fashiomable thing ever !!! Almost died when I saw them. The pink ones 😍😍😍( jockstrap+pink denim shorts)
My biggest insecurity is my nose It looks like my dad's nose . It's  really big. I tried to accept it but it's back to square one when my sister or brother comment on it
This is posted on my birthday and I love you SOOO much. This speaks words to me Riyadh, Keep doing you gorgeous!
I have always been insecure about my nose because it is huge but I thought that what you said about your nose being a part of you dad that you'll have with you even after he's gone was really cool. I got my nose from my dad too and thinking about it in that way makes me feel better about it. Love you lots Riyadh❤️
This is so beautiful guys, thank you for being so honest and loving!!!! ❤
Just know that you are absolutely beautiful, i could only hope that one day I could be with someone as beautiful and amazing a yourself :)
Probably the 2 things that bother me the most, is that i grew a foot and a half in a single year (so nearly half a meter, 0.45) and i have stretch marks all over my knees and arms and belly. it bugs me. as well as because of other problems i dont actually have any teeth.. at all. i have incredibly good looking permanent dentures but i always wonder if anyone can tell when i mispronounce something or w/e if its cause my teeth arent real :/
I used to be really insecure about my teeth color, but I got mine whitened this year too, Hannah, and that has made me feel so much better about them! The only thing I really don't like about how I look at this point physically (and I'm 47) is how overweight I am. I think the older you get, the more you just accept who you are and how you look (some do fight it kicking and screaming, but I don't recommend that). \n\nI'm getting age spots now, especially on my hands, and they remind me of both my grandmothers' hands, so I just love seeing them every day. What you said about your nose and mouth reminding you of your parents was beautiful, Riyadh!
Ahhh fuck. The boob bit really hit me (pun?) in the feels. For me, my big ass breasts are my biggest insecurity because it's always the first thing people look at when they see me. Seeing someone's eyes go straight to my boobs every time I meet them for the first time/serve a customer/walk past anyone on the street is a really shitty feeling. Being complimented on them (even by friends) is also the worst. I just want to scream 'I KNOW. THEY'RE BIG. THEY'RE GINORMOUS. I GET IT'. Someone approached me once on the tube and asked me how old my baby was (I had no baby in hand) and how lucky I was to be so young and still have a beautiful figure after giving birth. It's lead to me not being able to form any long term romantic relationships because it makes you feel like that is all they like you for and then you become unbearably insecure. I've found I over compensate for them in every aspect of my personality to try and make them seem smaller lol\nREPLY
1) i really hate my smile lines 2) i hate how big my ribs are  3) my butt is really flat 4) my hands and feet are really skinny and weird 5) my eyebrows
I recently had a rhinoplasty myself as I had a large nose (italian decent). When I was in high school my nose was always pointed out, everyone always said it was huge so I think my insecurity with it started there.\n\nI was really hesitant to have the procedure done at first because I thought, in a way, I was giving into the bullies, betraying me heritage and conforming to societal standards. It got to a point where my nose was upsetting me so much, I could barely look in the mirror, so I saved up and had a rhinoplasty and honestly, It's helped so much. I didn't change my nose completely, but just enough and it has stopped me from thinking about it 24/7.
You both look PERFECT!!!!  xoxo  (and L-O-V-E the nose!!)
My cousin Zach is insecure about the veins thing too! I'll pass this on to him for sure to know he wasn't the only one.
Nice video, but I would like to say....someone asking you Why are you insecure when you have a nice body is not skinny shaming. Like what...?
Kudos to you both for talking about your insecurities. That is so not an easy thing to do. No matter what to look like or who you are, everyone has something they are insecure about. Thank you for sharing. You are both beautiful people !
Honestly Riyadh , you are so stunningly beautiful! I understand the whole find imperfections attractive thing though. I'm the same.  I hate muscles on a guy. Keep up the good work & thanx for your honesty x x
Insecurity: When a 50 year bitch told me I am too short when I was 7...\nInsecurity II: When your bitch 12 years class might bully you look for 12 years\nInsecurity III: When you don't have muscle definition and  a body of a typical Asian (extreme thin)\n\nTherefore, I always feel ugly and disgusting all the time in school. I hate being on the spotlight in front people that i don't want to see. And I injured my knees because I play figure skate as a leisure sport for 13 years and I know when puberty hits me emotionally in the face I won't get tall. Sad fact to know, but there is nothing wrong to be short. Sometimes I ask, do I have to be look a certain way to be reassure the social norm? Nope.\n\nWords of wisdom: Stop fucking bully people because of something that they can't fucking change. You shit people who bullied me.
I am insecure about my small dick. I hate it and it keeps me away from dating.
I could get over biting my finger nails by excessively taking care of them. Ich bought myself a polish block and when I caught myself having chewed on my nails, I was so annoyed because I would have to polish them again. Now I don‘t take much care anymore, but the chewing has stopped.
All the loves. Thank you for putting yourself out there and sharing with us.  You're both beautiful and amazing. <3!
I loved this. Thank you both for speaking about it on such a natural way.
I can't even see ryhad's nose blemishes...
As I watched this, each insecurity that was said I just thought yep, me. Yep, me. Yep, me. (Only exclusion is not biting fingernails). It was wonderful to hear the discussion after each point for an external voice saying it's not a bad thing, and so I don't feel as bad about those aspects of myself. I'm close to 30 and still have to deal with the inner voice criticisms. Wonderful, honest video. Thank you lovelies.
I had a really intense obsession with biting my nails all throughout childhood. They would bleed all the time that's how bad it was. I still get the urge to bite when I'm stressed out but now I keep a nail clipper with me almost all the time so that when I start to get nervous I trim my nails before my teeth can get to them. It's also relaxing to trim them and the clean look is enough incentive to keep me from ruining my work. Sometimes I bite the nail trimmings just for the sensation. Sounds kind of gross, but mentally it's the same for me.
Gurl I'm with you on the nail biting. I hate myself for it but hey... As a musician people are always looking at my hands but I can't seem to stop myself biting! I get really embarrassed when people want photos or close-ups of my hands 🙈
i just started taking treatment for my hair thinning/loss... now i'm wondering is it going to do more harm than good as i continue to indefinitely try and chase my hair. will I just get obsessed with it.. should i try and accept it..
I will get a reduction with you!
I'm insecure about my my feet. They look completely healthy and clean, I'm just not that into showing them off. I remember when I was with ex, I would never take my socks off when we'd cuddle or sleep in the same bed.
You two are absolute gems! LOVE you both!! <3
You are both beautiful, don't change a thing about yourselves.
Riyadh you are so f.... perfect!!!!
We all have things we do not like or want to change.  It is good to to talk about it and understand you are not alone. I am glad you accepted your nose and there is nothing wrong with it.  Your likes in men are interesting as it show you are open minded by others but are harder on yourself.  A lot of people are like that.
I have forever been insecure about my weight and body shape, particularly around my tummy, similar to what you guys were talking about. I'll often make humour about not being able to wear certain things because i gots rolls, but i will also think more negatively like looking in the mirror and thinking that if i could just get rid of this then i would be happy with my body shape. I eat relatively healthy, i excerise regularly and i never see any change. Over the years i have learned to accept it and dressed so that i am happy with my appearance and my insecurity is disguised/hidden. But my feelings have changed over the last year, since being in a relationship, and to my surprise the change is for the better. This is the first time where i've been with someone who i feel truly celebrates every part of me, loves all my wiggly and squishy bits that someone might otherwise totally ignore  or god forbid even wish could be changed. Never in my life did i ever think i would find myself loving and appreciating the body parts i have got.
When I was in the 6th and 7th grade I was being bullied for being Jewish, biracial, and gay and all that stress built up, and effected me physically, since I always looked down my spine got used to being in that position. So when ever I stood I had to actively try to stand up straight, rather than just do it automatically. And I also gained a little weight also because of bullying. All this constantly reminded me of my personal dark ages. Now I have a normal weight, but I still have to actively try to stand up straight.
This was exactly what I needed, thank you thank you thank you guys! I am a tall and slim guy and Ican relate to the stomach thing. . But almost every guy seems to have that. But I forget about that easily...
Aww Riyadh so sweet that you feel that way about your mam and da !
With the boob thing, my gosh i got ghost pains when Hannah was hitting them! it would have hurt me SOOO much! Form everyone in my family they have said that all of their chests have reduced in size after breast feeding so thats a plus for you :) I really like this video i think its brave to point things out :)
I love this! You guys should really make this a regular segment. I love when you do videos together, they're always so fun, like your drunk advice video. Seriously, consider doing this on a more regular basis!
OH MY GOD BLESS HANNAH i have big boobs also and i never understood why i have next to no sensation in them until now!! i also have friends with small boobs who talk about how great they are sexually and i legit thought there was something wrong with me, this genuinely helped a LOT lol
I got no rolls haha
11 on trending !!!
OMG Hannah is so cute <3
Brill video; love you guys, justvas you are 😘
Riyadh be my boyfriend 😉😍😂😂😂
Hanna your ears are so fucking cute wdym
Hannah's fun bags are gorgeous!
MY FAVES
you look beautiful too, riyadh.
He reminds me of a fish but i cant remember its name...\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yea, Faggot.
Riyadh would say anything if he thought there was a BBC documentary in it. He should do a documentary on narcissism and humble bragging. (This guy recently posted a video of him in budgie smugglers slowly running into the ocean. Yeah, thats the sign of someone with serious body issues).
I wish there was a laughing Scott on the foot of every staircase in my life.
Got home from uni and there's a new watch me wednesday?! DAY MADE, TIME TO MAKE TEA AND COZY UP
Does stage door in the UK not have barriers put up near the door?  In the US, there is always a fence put up to create a walkway for the actors to leave.  Then fans can stand along the fence and ask for pictures/autographs.  There's also usually a stage door worker/body guard to help regulate traffic.
I was making a comment in my head along the lines of, oft, that foundations too light for you, Fletcher! And then I remembered...
Here, Glasgows crazy in general. It's what we do best!!! 😀😀 was meant to be there closing night but couldn't come cause I was ill 😰😰 hope everything else goes great!! xx
I love when you film warm up!!
Booked my tickets in April and was there for the last night in Glasgow with my sister.  Just an incredible show (as someone who has toured in shows ) this was by far the best.  There was not one person on stage who wasn't great.  I was so glad that we got to see Scott play Fester.  whoever casted this show deserves an award!  Thank you all so much for such a memorable night.
It is said that Hazrat Dawood (A.S) Qoum of about 70,000 Prople lived near the bank of Sea aella . They were very happy. Allah examine them by ordering them not to do fishing on saturday.\nhttp://www.islam360.ga/2017/10/how-12000-human-beings-turned-into.html

Carrie i went to see you in Glasgow and i enjoyed the show so much you and everyone in it were amazing honestly best show I've seen xx
casually dying all over again when I saw myself in the footage from the book signing 😂😂
Just been rewatching some videos from last Christmas, to help get me in the festive 'oh crap I have to make 20 presents for family' mood, and was wondering if you've had a chance this year to connect with Autumn? Love your channel and you are so incredibly talented. Xx
Hi carrie! Been watching you as a result of watching Tom and Gi as I have two boys the same age as buzz and buddy so really love their uploads and now also love yours. Wolverhampton is my local and I can't wait to see you Friday evening! Xxxxx
I’ve got a ticket to see the show on the 3rd of November in Dartford. None of my friends could make it so I’m braving the journey from Windsor on my own. So excited to see you all perform!xx
CARRIE OMG okay so if you read this I'm gonna cry I used to watch your channel so often when I was younger and was absolutely in love with you as Eponine - I saw you in Les Mis 3 times in a year! Anyways I re-discovered your channel on Monday and have since watched almost the entirety of your videos.. As soon as I found out you were in Addams on tour I begged my parents to somehow get me tickets and my nan just phoned me up and told me she'd got them so I'm coming to see you in Wolverhampton and by no means of exaggeration I just sat down to write this having screamed/jumped the house down for about 10 minutes - I am definitely crazier than you!! Im so so excited I think you're absolutely incredible. Due to anxiety theres no way I could perform in the West End but it will always be my dream no matter what, musical theatre gives me such an overwhelming sense of happiness. I really hope you see this I'd love for you to know how much you inspire me and how amazing it is to have behind the scenes musical videos of your insane talent. Anna xxx
I really like you Carrie.
Carrie, I love you! You have such a good heart!! You’re such a good person as well, I literally just want to hug you and be best friends!! Hahahaha! ❤️ X
YOU WERE SO GOOD IN WOLVERHAMPTON THE SHOW WAS AMAZING YOU WERE AMAZING YOU WERE ALL SO GOOD Hsjdj
I love love love LOVE your phone voice! So melodious!
These vlogs brighten up my weeks! I love how casual and friendly they are. The fact that they're personal but not too in depth makes me feel comfortable and not that I'm invading anyone's privacy. Love you Carrie!
Dear Carrie,\nI know the chances of you seeing this is pretty slim, but I was wondering if you'd let me interview you for my University dissertation. Im doing research into the differences between a stage productions vs a film adaptation, and was wondering if I'd be able to talk to you about your time in Les Mis? If you see this and are able to help, you can contact me on here or on twitter: @bex52296\nThanks! \nAll the best,\nBecca\nxx
The shade Carrie puts on for Wednesday is just my normal shade 😂😂
you're such a sweetheart
Om g I can't believe I'm in your video, twice! :D We here in Scotland love you ;)
best watch me wednesday yet - oliver getting locked out in his underwear cracked me up and i still can't stop chuckling! 😂😂 wish i was able to see the show again 😭🖤🖤
AYE I WATCHED CARRIE IN WOLVERHAMPTON TODAY
Was rewatching some of the first watch me wednesdays yesterday and I must say I've really missed Scott in the more recent ones! So great to see him again in this one, and so cool to see him getting to play Uncle Fester!
I came to the show in Wolverhampton today and oh my god I loved it so much! You and Sam blew me away! I could not take my eyes off of either of you, it's actually so mental! You're so talented and I've been watching you for so long now that it was amazing to finally get to see you, although I never got to meet you, I still got to see you and watch you do something that you enjoy so much! You're an inspiration and I hope to be able to perform on that stage one day <3
Oi oi I went to the 7:30 showing in Glasgow, absolutely loved it! The singing was amazing!!! The theatre was absolutely BOILING though, idk how you managed singing and all that with the stage lights and the overheated theatre!\nX
I'm really surprised, it's actually up on time. Love you carrie
omg carrie I went to see the adams family and i loved it you were absolutely amazing I couldn't of had a better night!
Just wanna say I saw the wolverhampton performance last night(Tuesday) was my second time, first saw it in Birmingham and became obsessed. Such a unique show, can't compare it to another. Yourself, Oliver, Scott and the ancestors blew me away again. I watched your stuff when I was younger like 18/19 but found it hard to relate but know we're roughly the same age I'm loving all that you do. ❤️☠️
Every time I get to the end of these watch me Wednesdays I'm not ready for the end.. I need more!😊
Your dress at the beginning is amazing 😍
OMG Carrie 2nd on trending !!! Absolutely LOVE this book it’s so amazing ❤️❤️
0:48! I have to know where you got that amazing dress!!!!
Scott’s laugh is EVERYTHING 🖤
Can u tell lurch that my dad used to play with him when they were young and he was called blob
IM SEEING YOU TOMORROW AND IM SO EXCITED
Can't wait to come down tonight to watch the show Xx
ayyy I can't wait to see you in Wolverhampton on Friday x
I would have love to come to stage door in dublin but i know what its like to finnish a performance in a theatre and just wanting to LEAVE and sleep ya know.
Omg you were standing right behind where I was sitting in this video! 😂
Guys help me out here I think I've missed the memo, is Les not doing Fester anymore? I saw him but I bet Scott is amazing because he is beyond fabulous!
I don't know why but I absolutely love it when you film your vocal warm-ups. They're just so fun to watch/listen to
Ahhhhh!!! I spot a Lindy Bop Library Bletchley dress at the beginning!!! Perfect dress for you. They just released another bookshelf dress - it's a Halloween special!!! It's a Matilda so very similar but without sleeves!!!
I saw the show on Friday in Glasgow and it was absolutely amazing! 🖤
Im from Wolverhampton. It's not exactly the best town but its good for a night out. Two places I would recommend to get a drink and food are either The Grain Store which is close by Mcdonalds or Wetherspoons which is opposite the theatre.
This is so wonderful, but I do want to say that it's okay to not have a PO Box, Carrie. I would never expect this from anyone, especially to have someone reply.
Everything about this show is just incredible... the dynamic between the cast is so unbelievably heartwarming and that shows when you're all on stage too. I've seen The Addams Family tour 4 times now- twice in Edinburgh, and once in Cardiff and Glasgow- and every time I watch it I fall in love with it even more. To tell the truth, I cried when I realised I won't be watching it again- I'll miss being able to go to the theatre, watch this production and leave with a huge smile on my face (although the smile hasn't left yet... it's been there for nearly a week since I last saw the show!)
Carrie! I walked into my local theatre today and asked how I could get involved in the current production! Casting was already done, but I’ve offered to work backstage and, guess what, they’re doing THE ADAMS FAMILY!!
My friend saw you in Wolverhampton last night! He said you were all incredible ❤
BEST part of the week is these vlogs! like if you agree!
I LOVE YOU CARRIE
OMG I danced at Glasgow Theatre Royal last year for Youth Dance Scotland. I feel so honoured that you have been there wow.
Sleepy from lush has saved my sleep during uni assessment! Thank you!!!
I've bought tickets for the Singapore show!!! Can't wait to see you perform Carrie!! and Oliver!! and Scott!!
Carrie you are wonderful! thank you for putting such lovely content on this platform :)
I don't know when you filmed this, but just the other week I commented on a photo of Scott's Instagram about how you guys could be the golden trio, And now I'm so happy that there are dolls of you as hogwarts students 😭
But what happened with the Unicorn!!!!????
ive never laughed harder when the changing room door locked behind oliver the second time 😂 😂 😂 absolutely priceless
Do take care of yourself! It's so wonderful to have such a supportive fan base, but you're 100% on point - safety first for all. Glasgow has a heart of gold. Favorite place in the world.
“People keep coming back to see the show”. Haha yep I saw it three times 😂😂
That panic rush to finish your I feel very detached sentence was so cute haha,
See you in a month Carrie! Hope Singapore treats you well! <3
Can anyone give me any information on how to send letters to Carrie at the show? I’ve always wanted to send one in and I live in Singapore and I’m not sure whether I should wait till the show comes here or what but I would LOVE to be able to send a letter in 💓
One thing we learn as we age is that everyone is fighting their own little war and not all of us are victorious.
I just can ' t wait to \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Carrie at Singapore !
Oliver getting locked out of the dressing room with no trousers on had me in fits of laughter. Daft sod thought he was so cool for a second before karma caught up to him.
Thank you for being so friendly when I met you at the Glasgow signing- I am the girl in the bright yellow coat and the hat. We Glaswegians are a bit 'cray cray' but in a good way! Hope you enjoyed your time here. It is lovely to see you get so emotional reading your letters. You are a joy to watch.
Carrie you are incredible. Thank you for sharing your experiences and showing us different sides to you I think we have all cried and laughed with you. Whatever your dealing with please no it wont always be this way. We all love you x
Came to see the show in Glasgow!!! It was amazing my whole family loved it !!!!❤️❤️❤️
So gutted I'm not coming to see you in Wolverhampton! My home town!  Really wanted to come and watch the show. You've all been amazing to watch in these videos.
I saw that door locking with Ollie in his pants before he even realised. Nearly spilt tea everywhere!
Well I'm glad I'm not the only one who slides back under the changing room doors in Hollister 😂
It was so amazing to finally meet you Carrie and I'm glad everyone in Glasgow was polite and respectful! Makes me proud of my city :)
I love you and I really happy you are having a good time on your shows!! I really enjoy watching you, you are so funny and I love how human you are. That must sound weird but some other YouTubers ( no shame to them) try to seem perfect. Even in their blogs but you aren’t afraid to show the world who you are ( but you might be faking idk) and I think that’s really brave. You are my idol. Thank you
Ha I totally remember having to sing that Phantom of the Opera warm up when I was little 😂
My friends seeing you in the Addams Family next week and I am so jealous haha!
I still can’t get over the fact how different stage door in the UK is, compared to stage door here in the Netherlands. I wonder what Celinde thinks about it.
Had a bit of a rotten day but Oliver being locked out of a fitting room in his pants gave me the good laugh I needed. Thank you Carrie for brightening my day with every video! xx
*pauses video*\nOh my lord, Carrie, I would love to see you play Christine Daae in Phantom of The Opera. <3
I have a mighty need to hop on a plane, go across the pond, and catch one of these performances...
You're videos always make my day a bit better. just know that you're loved. Also, can Oliver stop flirting with that door. Goodness.
Has Scott completely taken over as Fester? Or is the actor just on leave? Either way, awesome opportunity for him. \nAnd Oliver getting locked out without pants, of course. XD
Miss Frizzle dresses are my aesthetic.
Those Harry Potter dolls are so adorable!
I went to stage door at the afternoon show (2.30-5-ish) on Saturday and you didn’t come out, which I was fine with because you had a show after that, but there was a group of girls in front of me who were really angry that you didn’t come out and were muttering about how disrespectful it was that you didn’t come out and my Mum actually had to turn around and explain that they were being extremely disrespectful to you
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Great vlog! Xxxxx
TRENDING AT NUMBER 2
love your t-shirt at 4:05  <3<3<3
Thanks Carrie ❤
LOVE YOOUUUUUUU :)
😍😘😘
Well hello oliver :D hehe damn i wish i was u carrie lucky bugger kissing that hunk
Will you be doing the Q and A after the show in wolves tonight? Have been waiting to see this show for ages!
I went to see lee mis on Broadway a couple of years ago and their stage door was so much more organised and a lot safer than ours over here, they had a barrier that people stood next to and the cast came behind so the actor wasn’t in the middle of a big crowd, still got photos and good chats but I think it worked really well. Don’t know what you think to that. Respect all your work and I love all your stage work after seeing you several times in both Addams Family and Les Mis, thank you for everything you do for your fans xxx
Uh oh, the costume mistress in me is saying 'where are your earrings?!'
that bookcase dress is simply lovely and so are you!
I'm just waiting to see Mike's face when he sees El again...
What did one wall say to the other wall?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet you at the corner once I'm done giving birth to this child.
This is exactly how I came out of my mom’s vagina.
At 0:49 I was laughing cause it’s so fucking funny how el makes that disgusted sound and continues to slowly wipe that shit off onto her dress lmao I love her 😂💞
She's kind of annoying when out of character...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldK9qvRBkMI
I wonder if Harry Jew Fuck Weinstein molested her.  Jews are killing Hollywood.
I hope they don’t make more than 3 seasons of this, I feel like there’s not much more they could do.
Millie could make an ideal stage Peter Pan! At first glance I thought she's a very pretty boy with long curly hair, and she almost sounds like a really adorable boy.
She is way too sophisticated for her age, like i find it cringy almost. I know that's a bit harsh but... yeah.
Reminds me of that video I watched one time... Live birth I think it was called
Excited for season 2. Millie is such a good actress, especially being so young and playing such a big character :)
Wake up folks, it's a boy.
I think Mike and El's reunion is gonna be so sweet! Between that, the new characters and finding out what happened to poor Will in the Upside-Down that's causing his terrible sickness, I'm so pumped for season 2!
Who's the new girl? We haven't gotten much on her yet
I'm just still trying to figure out how she'a alive
This is how feminists are born
I watched the first episode only \nSo do they find their friend?
Oh my gods, I cannot wait for season 2!!
I have a feeling this is one of the first scènes of the new show....yessss you go girl!!!
Close your eyes while watching it
god i forgot how scary eleven was a times I LOVE HER!!!!!
looks like a young kevin keegan
I was biting my entire wrist watching this.
Never seen before clip... cos it hasn't been released yet millie lol
It's very rare to find a cast that works. Every single person who starred in this is fantastic. So I'm grateful to see another season. Only downside, if this continues to be great. The Duffer brother's can rip up their plans for an ONLY 4 season show, cos' this has the potential to go the full hog like 'Supernatural' has and Eric Kripke only planned that for 3-5 season's at most; now look at it. Yeah 'Stranger Things' is a cool show. Love it.
I love her hair so much
I want to ruffle her hair.
When she said in the mean time check out this.... her hand gesture reminded me of every granddad in the world.
look how Russian police tries to stop this man\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sgcDVIfoD0
I can’t wait to see mikes face when he sees 11 again
Me trying to come out
I am actually so excited!!!
Awww yes! Canny wait!!!! A wee catch up wi season one is at hand me thinks! Hmmmm.... *taps lips with forefinger* 😙
I have no words rn
Showed this to my mother, she said this was how i was born.
I have long hair
Glad I'm actually going there for the Friday
She looks like Mike!
That was easier done then said...
Millie Bobby Brown Best Poses https://goo.gl/2Ly1s6 Live Video
I thought that was a boy with curly hair.
Omg omg so el and mike haven’t seen each other for probably almost a year and I can’t wait to see their reactions when they see each other. I’m crying
I literally CANT WAIT !!! It’s coming on the best day possible it’s the day before i go on holiday so I can download it and watch it on the plane 😆😆 IM LITERALLY WAITING TO SEE MIKES REACTION TO EL
There's no way this shit is keeping me from the snowball DAMN IT!
E é nesse momento que vc fala, FODEU
Same A.J Taylor\nI can't wait for season two
Yeah that hole in the wall doesn’t look like anything and certainly isn’t symbolic of rebirth...
please share and subscribe the latest video which covers POSTNATAL/POSTPARTUM depression  in UNDER 3 MINUTES;\nhttps://youtu.be/oVgn12jhmLo
her real accent annoys me for some reason...
Don’t let the predators get you Millie!!!! 😔
Want to know more about MCM London Comic Con, 27-29 October? \n\nFind out all about the show here: https://goo.gl/WLvsaR and buy tickets here: https://goo.gl/M7w58g
Holy shit she's English?
SHE'S SO GREAT AND I'M SO HYPED AHH
I think this is supposed to symbolise a kind of rebirth for 11. that's why she came out of a big vagina.
Wow she's  British LOL.
Tracy Beaker... Ahem...
Looks like she might be in Star Wars episode 8
Can you sub me I need to get to 325 subscribers before my birthday 28th October it’s all I would like for my birthday! Besides giving my family more love for the next chapter of my life 💗💗💗
Did I just watch a wall give birth to her,that's sure as hell what it looked like lmao
Can't wait for it to start, been looking forward to this.
Ahhhhh not to be a creep, but damn the Foley sounds for this are incredible. That release of air as the membrane bursts is super satisfying to the ears
Then the janitor walks by
This is a wig. El has hair now 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I'm pretty sure they released this because it was 11 days until the release date lol
Boy or girl?
I wasnt expecting that accent...
Mike, she’s still your date remember, she’s comingggg
AH
Wait el is alive wtf yesssssssss😄😄😄
Thank you Millie!!!!!
No more Yul Brenner
Eleven is alive
*1:20** Neo...is that you...?*
whend her hair come back
edubs > rive gum
definetly will watch thuis
Give me more!!!!
thats what good pussy sound like
Seen it before
HOLLY FUCK OMG ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OH MY GODDDDDD!!!!
Awesome 👏
01:16 Ace Ventura any one?
HOLY SHIT !!!
WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW
So she was vaporized in season 1 and just suddenly walked around the corner and found a hole to climb through?  Yea, this is super weak.
I think that the demogorgon and eleven are the same things because in the game the two headed demogorgon is used as the monster where one head is good and other bad. So as eleven got out of the Upside Down the other half did too. In the end when El raised her hand the monster raised its hand too in the same way El did. \n\n\nAlso in the game the 7 headed snake thing might be a clue to what the monster is in season 2 😉\n\n(Just a theory😂)
@everyone PEOPLE OF KEKISTAN! Our noble and supreme kekistan leader bigmantyrone has declared a meme jihad against boston SJW's. We must do our service and shitpost on every social media sight, and spread the word of kekistan. shadilay my friends. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Oh it's a girl.
I cannot wait for the sex scene with el and mike
Why does she have short hair while breaking out. Shouldn’t she have cutly hair now
Why are shows like this overhyped aF
Anyone else think it was Tracey Beaker in the thumbnail
when El was struggling to breathe, I was struggling to live. 😭 it hurt me physically. my poor baby!! She made it out safe, but my poor baby!!
So from what I can tell, El can create gates to go in and out of the upside down, or at least change them.
IS THAT A GIRL OR FAGGOT
Wers barbie?
The kiss blow at the end was kinda... weird... considering she's a really young kid\n\nNever change Hollywood?
The lady in red looks like she from the 90s
you pretty, let's kiss?
Its a good thing it wasn't a guy who kissed her or we'd have every triggered feminist in the world blowing up the comments.
Well thank you I haven't got that in a while 😂😂
If a man did that he'd become the new Harvey Weinstein
Not sexual assault if genders are the same then?
What it's just a man kissing his girl
*Fake laugh it off \n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Ahhh HAHAHAHAHA.
Sexual assault right there.....
female harvey weistein
I hope cecilia tweets out me too and points out it was a woman who did it!
All what needs to happen is she kicks her ass in the ring.. trying to psych her apponent out with kissing her is fucked up, no touching should ever happen in the weigh in.
I Can't wait for the main event
Literally the most pathetic attempt at a PR stunt.
She wants to Turner in her into her female dog
So where’s all the sexual assault charges for this? Or does it not count because she’s a woman.
This Mikaela guy just did what any other dude would have done in his place.  Cecilia is hot.
1 million views - we all know that 99.99% of them were men
0:12 Does she feel the connection too, fk it. I'm going for a kiss.
Make love not war
Thing people do to promote fights theses days 😏
Is that sexual harassment?
literally rape/sexual assault\nwonder what'd happen if a man ran up and did that to her
Sexual assault. Imagine if that was a man on a woman?? All hell would break loose. She only reacted by laughing because she was in complete shock and that is evident. That is disgusting.
She took it super well
Well. Here we go again.
All of a sudden my diddly needs a fiddly
Mikaela Laurén should mind herself and her actions. What she did was assault. She should be ashamed of herself.
These fucking lesbian's think they can get away with everything these days
Freak
That's just wrong imagine if it was a guy who had done it instead
If that was a man doing it to a woman there would be uproar...
And now she’s gay
Isn't this the same thing harvey did??
Part Two is available on youporn
She proper got sucked into those eyes and caught feelings 😭 Cecilia Braekhus is a legit Jedi
I wonder what wouldve happened if she kissed back?!
No way, that dude kissed the other dude.
Imagine if a guy tried this
wow this is outright wrong and abusive. she was laughing just to come to terms to what happened not cause she loved it!!!! it was an act of powerplay and disgusting
I mean it's got people wanting to watch the fight
Add her to the list of sexual assaultists
Oh for fuck sake, i wasn’t ready for this amount of cringe in such a small space of time :(
Other than the fucked up aspect it's good the one who got kissed, laughed it off and shit, but damn that's embarassing lol the other bitch tried to move to her opponent but opponent slapped her back HAHAHAHA
That made my dick really fucking hard
Wasn't staged or anything was it.
Hmm i can picture make up sex after the fight.
I would of done the same, don't blame that man
I think they just want attention...
Enquiry incoming. Oh wait, it's not the US.
If this is equality... I like it
Gets old after the 5th time watching it
I bet some guy was there like Yes yes now kiss then they kissed and his mind was fucking blown
That was good and a nice reaction.
What tf did I just watch?
cameraman was quick on the shutter!
Don't bite! Arghhhh! Oh it's a kiss 😋
is that not sexual assault
Female?
They kissed so what?
would smash
I lasted 45 seconds
LoL
kisses on ...... 😔
Cringe
Directed by iddubz
Kisses and smile wow I enjoyed
einai mre lesvies

ijueputa colombiana esa! haber si cuando te mande a la lona reaccionas igual de estupida!
machorras asquerosas este deporte no es para mujeres  luego de ahi salen varias engendros como estos
*Lesbian orgasm fight preview?*
Imagine Conor McGregor doing this to Mayweather

Boxing: Man kisses Man = Knockout Woman kisses Woman = Smiles all round. Conclusion = Dafuq
I bate my meat
Awesome, whens the fight?
Ela gostou! Hahaha
Fucking hot

I smell wet pussies
They look like clones
Strange things
Lol ...
Attention...
Aroused!
female boxer lol
Bitch
very bad
thats clearly a man
Damn got a half chub going
They both look weird af
That's just disgusting. Cecilia may have been laughing, but that must have been just to comfort herself from such an attack. You can see how disgusted she felt in the look on her face and her urge to get away ASAP.
Wow, if that's what she does outside of the ring I wonder what she would do when she's inside the ring. Grab her by the pu... oh that joke's old now.
Probs gonna end up fucking after the fight 🤤💦🍆
Not in front of the camera's.
She was low-key into it...her opponent will straddle her and ride her like a horse after the fights over and the lights have dimmed down..
she laughing cuz her pussy got wet
I'm pretty sure thats called sexual assault.
Why not do a programme called my week as a Brit living as a minority in my own country and see the shit they have to put up with hmmm?
Muslims are the sweetest most generous and kind hearted people on the planet. :)   Anyone saying otherwise is an ignorant moron simply looking for a place to direct their misguided hate. If you want to hate someone, hate Rupert Murdoch. He and his friends are directly responsible for the evil in the world right now.
Another far left vehicle to portray White British people as racists. What about my week living in Rotherham as a child?
Islam isn't a race, so cut the shit about it being racist to be critical of it.   There's no islam gene.  \nBeing a Muslim has nothing to do with skin colour.  It's a BELIEF, anyone can CHOOSE to believe in it regardless of skin colour.   And as it's a BELIEF anyone and everyone has the right to challenge that BELIEF in the same way everyone and anyone has the right to challenge mine. \n\nIt's ludicrous to suggest you're a racist because you dislike Islam because you have white skin.   It's religious fascism. \n\nIf it were a German who blew up a concert full of little children Channel 4 would be running an article on how bad Nazis are.  But because it's a Muslim, they run an article about how Racist everyone is being instead....\n\nChannel 4 just being a cock again.
This is very serious n I'm sorry for this.... Bo Selecta. Haha 😂
Why does channel four not show intolerance in islamic countries? The British have been tolerant to these guests for a very long time, but now I feel its time for them to check out.
Why paint her face, Islam is not a race
I’m getting so fed up with this shit. Islam is a foreign ideology, I encourage people who believe Islam is some ‘lovey dovey wonder religion’ to actually read the quran. Not only does it show that it is incompatible with modern secular democracies, as it actively encourages its followers to install a theocracy and implement sharia law wherever they have the majority. It also will give you some answers as to why rape and sexual assaults are so common in the Muslim communities. They can treat unbelievers however they like, we are referred to as kuffirs, and Muhammad, the most perfect human who ever existed according to Muslims, told his followers it was their right to take sex slaves in war. I have no idea how criticism of an ideology has been attributed to racism, to do so is dangerous and manipulative.
Why would anyone watch this ? Does anyone care ?
Y'all can Piss right Off Pakis, Niggers, Immigrants and White UK Trash all slander and gossip about people! Total bullshit they have been doing it since the beginning of time
Who would want to me a muslim
If scientologist kept blowing themselves up and killing innocent people would we have a problem with outlawing them?
The only thing Channel 4 is doing right. #GBBObacktoBBC
Islam is a religious society that hates women and treats them as second class. If I'm wrong remove the hajab and the berker, then dress like everyone else. Sadly this will never happen because the brain washing the women go through and the mutilation of there sex organ.
Channel 4 had some other Muslim propaganda show where half the Muslims in it were pretending to be moderate but saying extremist shit on twitter daily. Stop trying to divide society with this propaganda and let the truth come out no matter how bad it looks.
Obviously not all Muslims are extremists....I despise all types of extremists; Islamic Terrorists, racists, feminazis etc
The hypocrisy of the British media is actually beyond pathetic. By their standards, a Muslim tv channel should send an undercover person to a white neighbourhood to see if white Christian people are good or not because of murderous actions of the U.K. Government.
Why does multiculturism have to happen in white countries? Also before you say that you stole our land IT WAS THE ZIONISTS!\n\nWhy do us europeans have to suffer from the hands of the zionists now as well with this multiculturism agenda? Can we not just get the zionist bankers all off our backs and then we can give europe back to us europeans while the muslims can have thier counrties back.
6533 views 96/61 likes/dislikes. Why is this shit on trending?
FUCK YOU CHANNEL 4............ FUCK YOU INVADING PAEDOPHILE WORSHIPPING BASTARDS!
Ignorant woman
Amazing editing. So, they make a show with the premise that white northerners are a bunch of ignorant racist, and then a muslim  blows himself up at a pop concert killing a load of innocent kids. And, they still have the cheek to spin the narative that the Muslims are the victim. Wow, just wow.
Did they... brownface her?????
Sick of hearing about annoying Muslims , Muslim this, Muslim that, Muslim did this , Muslim did that. What’s the obsession with this death cult
Looks great
No Racist or Anti-Islamic Comments!!! 👍
CHILL THE F OUT!! Stop being so narrow minded.. if all muslims have to pay for the psycho who attacked Manchester arena, then all white people have to pay for the Las Vegas shooter. \nYou humans are going to be your own demise.
Lets wait for all the crazy skinheads that copy and paste from hate sites to appear in the comment section, yes yes muzlamic rayguns taking all yer jobs but somehow taking all your benifits and women yes yes mix culture is white genocide bla bla, go back to your country terrorist bla bla anything else they might add? Did I miss anything
Can't wait for the huge brigade of racist fucks to drown themselves in their circle-jerk cock-fest.
Hopefully this documentary will get rid of stereotypes
What is it with Channel 4 and programmes about muslims...there's one coming out every other week...they're obsessed...
What the fuck is this?? Channel4 have totally missed the mark here. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to put prosthetics on somebody to make them a caricature of people of a different race (as if being white and muslim are exclusive anyway???) On primetime TV in 2017??? Madness!!!
said she feels ashamed to live hear,islam is not welcome,Nothing but a death cult of intolerance,Muslims out of uk...
As some1 who has a muslim family I do think this is a good idea as lots of humans are bad at putting themselfs in the shoes of others. I should also say that I myself am an atheist but my parents are Muslim
Here's the directors cut of that show https://youtu.be/pSdG-RRlqpw
Why would they make a episode of that for dont they get enough off us
Why does she have to dress up to be a Muslim. Anyone in the world can be a muslim Black or White. Silly cunts

if this burns your eyes imagine how the animals tested on feel :(((((
I hope your a kind,innocent,sweet person off camera..
you literally didn't even try with these products. bronzer went way to high and too messy and too big of a brush. cream blush is supposed to go under powder. Maybe not use so much foundation.
this look was a fuck up ahaha QQQ
Omg love you so much Michael. Also do u reckon that primer was making the foundation twice as bad, because I have that primer and no matter what foundation I use it makes it lift and go dry and powdery?(almost as if nothing will stick on that patch anymore) 💕💕
U came thru once again with part 2!!😂 Ayyyyoooooooooo 🗣💓💓💓💓
That's a face for radio
It takes me 10 minutes to get ready. Fuck makeup
U should go out clubbing or something wearing this make up look
you just gained a new subscriper!😘👏❤
Omg yes Michael!! I used the infallible foundation and it looked disgusting on my skin!! There was a massive patch on my face from where the foundiddlydation wouldn’t stick and I thought I was doing something wrong. Thanks for saying the day again. Rock on hun❤️🤘😚
This look looks like you're going to ask for my manager. IM SCREAMING ❤️❤️
Why is a man wearing makeup?
That L'Oréal foundation is GOD AWFUL HUN 🤷🏻‍♀️ it literally aged my skin. I looked grey as fuck. THATS A PROBLEM.
the contour stick didn't work cuz its the wrong color lol
I love the total cover, have you tried placing it on you face from the bottle if that makes sense, then I use a sponge to blend it out, I have used a flat top brush but I feel like the sponge works better
Do more of these!!!
Can I have your eyeshadow pallet since you don't like it lol.
I find that the foundation is way too thick and cakey on its own, so I decided to mix it with my L’Oréal true match and I found that foundation so much better xx
That's do gay gay lord wearing fake nails wtf
Ngl it’s not always the products it’s the way they are being used Ngl just try different techniques 💯
I get cream blushes for people with perfect skin and natural looks
Even if the shadows are shit that purple makes your eyes pop out of this literal world. Cya
I loveeee when you do these type of videos, you're so funny
why is this on the tending page???i want to be in the trending page too.
Use the setting spray to wet your brush for highlights!!!!
Why are you putting on make up \nI dont have any objection to trans \nJust let it be known that you are a dude until the snip snip\nBut still, you look alright
This whole tutorial is A PROBLEM THAT CANNOT BE FIXED.
I use that foundation too & I thought it was just me!! It doesn’t cover my nose & it just doesn’t look good
i was crying over a boy and i knew that if i watched this i would feel better and i was right lol love you!!!!!
Holy shit. You look like a hot mess. Good to know about products though!
do a video on the setting powders that give flashback
Are you a guy?
I had the same issue with the foundation!! Sooo horrible, I’m ended up mixing mine with some rose hip oil and another foundation but it’s still pretty crap
Maybe a darker shade of contour...  I seen lighter people using darker colors
Where’s the other video of him using the setting spray I can’t find it 😩
You have mental problems! Freak show, circus, this way --->
It's Subculture as fuck. Ha! I love that Subculture is now an adjective meaning shitty ...
dude what the fuck is the purple shit that looks terrible!
Worst vid ever Michael, now I need another one....cyaaaaa!
I love your full face of makeup I hate videos! They're amazing, really light up my day! Please make a part 3 soon! x
bloody hell are you a boy or are you a girl? there are no grey sections, stop pretending. make your mind up please.
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO
take a shot everytime he says c ya!
He seems nice, I wonder if he's gay. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
What the fuck is that creature
THE PRO GLOW FOUNDATION DOES THAT STINGING AND BURNING THING TOO BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME
I’ve also tired that foundation and it really doesn’t work, it’s discusting x
Please can you do a review on the too  faced chocolate non Bon’s palette!!
Why the fuck is this shit on trending?
This video has made my day!! 

1cwuh3WDztU,New subscriber!!
That milani is a highlighter for darker skin as in black skin not a bronzer as it states

same problem with that concelar, thought i was the only one lol ..that concelear is crazy thin
This is why I hate the trending tab
Please do some challenges vid and a meet and greet in Brisbane
That foundation suuuuucks with a beauty blender. A brush is a must and it will work way better
i’m thinking you got a bad batch or something if the natasha denona pallete because her shadows are known for being good. weird because you can make anything look good and that shit pulled a subculture on you 😂
I absolutely hated the L'Oreal Total Infallible foundation when I tried it on its own but now I mix it with the original Infallible foundation and it works great!
I would bang her...
Why do all beauty gurus have the same intro?\nEdit: I'm not hating in any way
You made my day! This Video is fucking amazing 👍🏼🤣👌🏼🔥🕺🏼
Hey I’ve been watching since 4K subscribers!!!!!! If you don’t want it can you send me the primer😂I have super oily skin and I would love to try it. Love you lots your amazing!!!!!!!

Wtf...... 😶
See you when you get back, man. Hopefully see you before then. Take care of yourself
I think perhaps a part time job might be good for you? You seemed quite happy at the bookstore, and it gave you a place to go, be around and talk to new people. I personally think it's important to have one's life in chunks so you can appreciate how different all the places are. (Work, school, hobbies, relaxation, exercise, visiting family) Being in one place too long kinda makes you go crazy and overthink. But I find that being productive in lots of different areas helps keep you productive in the creative ones simply because your mind wants to just go to the next thing, and if it's a creative one, it just does it automatically. Maybe it's just me. But food for thought.
We'll miss you, but you being happy with what you do is infinitely more important. I do really look forward to PMS and hope you'll be back soon, but I hope even more that you get to find what you want and take genuine time out for yourself!
Acknowledging a failure and realizing how something makes you feel is the only way to improve yourself. Even if a well articulated word wound pushed you there.
God I really wish I had the time to do what you're doing. I'm in my last semester at uni and I've not been doing as well and I would love the time to think about what I'm doing and who I am and come back. I'm glad you're able to do it though and I'm interested to see what comes from it!
This is actually inspiring,  no I mean this has inspired me to legitimately make something....thanks Dan!!!
You'll be back and we'll be here, no pressure!
You might wanna try uploading something unique and spontaneous. It’s up to you what you do
I completely agree with the comments that VEDO isn't a failure because its caused you to look introspectively which is a crucial for personal growth BUT also wanted to point out that the period right before growth is SO uncomfortable and shitty. But it is worth it. \nI like to think of the uncomfortable stage like a caterpillar changing into a butterfly - like that has to be uncomfortable and confusing as f**k for the caterpillar! But works out so beautifully in the end
Wishing you the best of luck x
But like...whateveeeeer, the world's not gonna end. That was not a fail. That is not a failure.
I love how all the comments are just complete & utter support, we love ya & want you to be happy with what you're doing. You haven't failed, you've tried something again & realised that it doesn't work, you've grown. Being creative in any sense is so much harder than people realise, for every new story or poem I write there's about 10s of ideas that haven't worked out for me. But then when you land on the right idea, enjoy making it (such a big part of the process) and end up with something wonderful  - it's worth it all. If you hadn't started & stopped VEDO you wouldn't have realised that this is how you need to create right now :) sending all the positive vibes your way x
You're a creative genius, everyone who is anyone believes that your skill and talent to create and entertain is something so special. I'm glad you're listening to your head and it's not a failure to discontinue this, it's a decision. And we respect your decision. We love and believe in you ❤️
That idea of what failure is was really nicely put in a song called Rich by Marillion,

oPWiR4jrqpI,\n

oPWiR4jrqpI,\nFailure isn't about falling down, failure is staying down.

oPWiR4jrqpI,\n

oPWiR4jrqpI,\nLooking forward to seeing you getting back to making content that YOU think is worth uploading.
I know I’m joining the wonderful hoard of people in these comments, but I just wanted to say they you haven’t failed. Yes, you didn’t upload everyday but if you had it would have likely been all filler... while I love your videos and will watch them regardless because I like the way you think and speak, they are always more entertaining when you enjoying the process of creating them. You can’t force creativity and that’s ok ❤️
daniel i enjoy your videos. not only because they make me smile and make that weird snorting sound i make called a laugh but because you are so lovely and kind and i just want to hug you and make you some comfort food when you’re sad because somehow whenever i fall into a deep depression you always post a cooking video and i wish we could be friends so i could maybe cheer you up but for now a simple thankyou, a like on every video and recommending your channel to everyone is what i hope is enough
Before I continue on with this video, your 'bit white' is my normal skin tone <3
Yeah go ahead and kill off some dragons and level up, and then come back and show us what you got.
I’m a teacher to 11 year olds and I tell them daily, failing is proof you’re trying. Failing is growing. \n\nYou’ve not failed, you’ve grown
You haven't failed, if anything this lapse in creative inspiration will lead you down a path you never would have walked down if you hadn't admitted to yourself that what you were doing wasn't making you happy. We'll all be here eagerly awaiting the next chapter of your YouTube adventure and if you decide that making YouTube videos isn't for you and you find another outlet for your creativity then I for one will be right there behind you. Never give up. <3
i still love you daniel xx
It sounds like this revelation is gonna take you on a new path and that's. Exciting. You are giving yourself a new freedom to create some amazing things dan and even if you make a few supposedly crap ones along the way, that's fine. I don't even think anything you've made this month was crap, everyone loves simply listening to you talk. We are all ready for whenever you next release a video and we all support whatever decisions you make, including this one. Don't be too hard on yourself bubs❤️
I think as a society we put so much worry into not failing, but failing is how we learn. We fuck up and we go, oh, alright i didn't like how that felt, im going to make sure next time i try harder or differently to get a better or different result. \nFrom what you said in this video, it sounds like you've learnt from your mistakes. So when you're ready, dust yourself off and get back on the metaphorical horse as long as you decide that metaphorical horse riding is for you.
I am so curious as to what the comment that sparked this was
love you dan <33 looking forward to the new content when you're feeling better. have a good break <3
a lot of wisdom, a lot of strength, fuck vedo you do what feels right (can't wait for the next pms :)
You should do vlog every even/ odd day (veedo/ veodo)... another time though x
We fail because we are human.  I enjoy your videos whenever you post them :)
Failures in life are horrible necessary things that set you on a path to learning. You should absolutely allow yourself the time and space to think about what happened, what you need and what to do next.\nIt's not the end of the world that VEDO stopped in the middle of the month, we'll all end up missing your face and voice, but what's the point of you're miserable?! I'm not that much of a sadist.
Love your hair. How do you ask for it at the hair dressers
On different circumstances this video helped me a lot to watch today. I had my first gcse dance exam and I blanked out through 2 counts of 8 and I just stood there debating what I should do before I ended up rushing back into it. I came out of the studio and hid in a corner and sobbed! I'd still got another dance to do a little while after and even though everyone was telling me how it wasn't noticeable and no one was ever going to know how badly I messed it up (because I was in a group and so it just looked like there was a focus on the duo ) it was still important to me that I had put so much time and effort into the work to have just blanked out and forgotten the whole section. I'm still angry and upset over it but that doesn't mean that I am a failure, it just means that I let nerves get the better of me. Hopefully it wasn't all that noticeable and I still get an acceptable grade out of it.
The word failure has become something big and terrifying today, but it honestly isn't. Failure is making a mistake. Failure doesn't mean that you always make that mistake or will again, and failure doesn't define a person. Even if you fail, you can accept that you did what you did and learn from it. Failure means you're learning and growing. Next time you want to do another video every day of a month, think why you want to do it. I hope you take care of yourself first before your channel. <3
Practice some self compassion! And remember that your whole worth is not entirely dependent on external factors - I.e. you do not become unworthy because you haven't succeeded. You are still you, and people love you for that! Replace your self critical thoughts with thoughts of things that Hazel would say, and be a friend to yourself ♥️
You're my fave vlogger bc no one but the vlogbrothers are as engaging, articulate, and intelligent. And that comes pretty naturally to you, so keep being you. :)
Ill miss you Dan! I really do love everything you do even if you just ramble to the camera because its like having a conversation. Im glad you are taking time to make yourself happier with what you do. Just know that we will be here when you get back ^^ we love you Dan!
you didn't fail, you just realised it's not for you and that's okay !! im looking forward to future videos x
Listen Dan , i’ll be serious for a bit\nYou are not failing in any way or term \nCuz if you didn’t realize, you care about quality over quantity, which mean you care about how you are presenting yourself to your audience, which mean you take your youtube job seriously, so that probably mean you’re a successful person , maybe you’re not a big youtuber , but that doesn’t mean you’re not successful !\nALLLLSSSSOOOOOO\nI watch your videos because of your voice , I don’t really know why \nSo even if you uploaded a video that was “rubbish” believe me I will still watch it , as long as you’re talking in it\nSo you can make sure that i’m always giving you views -unless i die or smth lol-
You'll figure it out.  Everyone does things differently and you just need to find what works for you, and makes you happy and fulfilled.  You haven't failed - you've just found something that doesn't work for you - and that's progress :-) xx
I really like what we see of you and I want to like your content but it always feels like there’s something missing for me. I hope this is the start of some refreshing videos from you when you return
I'm sad we won't see as much of you but I'm so excited about the outcome!
Maybe try abomped... a bit of my project every day... then post it on the last day?
and we'll be waiting for you❤️
You haven’t failed. I promise, you’ve just evolved
Hmmm I think you're confusing trying with failing - the reason I keep coming back to your channel is because I can see my own desires to be a certain person and produce certain types of work reflected in your ambition and intent and desire. You're giving everything a go and trying to work out which is the best fit for your channel. If your most recent attempt of VEDO didn't fit in with your idea of your channel, that doesn't detract from your identity and impact (tbh, just look at your followers - more and more I'm reading comments in your voice because their turn of phrase has absorbed your mannerisms). Deciding to stop and make deliberate choices, videos and express considered thoughts, ideas, content, is what is really admirable (and more needed on youtube/creative platforms, imo). If you didn't feel like VEDO worked, then that's just crossing an idea off your list, but it doesn't mean the end of the list. And your personality is such a likeable and kind (and witty) one, it permeates whatever you create anyway. That's why so many people are commenting what? You didn't fail? I loved your VEDO videos! Hope you gain some insight on your break :)
Don't look at it as failing. I started the year with a plan for a project to make a video celebrating a holiday/festivity every day of the year. I got to June but felt less and less happy with it as I went. So changed what my goals were. I took August off completely from it and am now I've restarted but if I miss a day... Well I miss a day. I've failed by my original scale sure so I changed the scale.
This is what happens to every YouTuber ever, this isn't new right? I mean everyone tries for an upload schedule and they realize it's gonna be hard work cos it then becomes a job
See if you resonate with this one: your Youtube channel is great, you're great.
Lol I don’t really get it because I liked all the vedo videos ._. Is it just me? Anyway you don’t need to do things you don’t want to!
Well Dan, I can respect the reasons why you'll be taking time off, and I plan to watch again when you post videos. If I can offer a comment to tuck in your pocket before you go, it would be to tell you the reasons I watched your videos in the first place.\n\n1) Like your accent, true fact. But you're charming too.  \n2) Enjoyed your interactions with your friends. It reminded me of being young and having more social times, getting out and embracing live and having little adventures and fun times, full of laughter. Loved that day you and Louise went to the antique fair and purchased loads of cheese. (Totally something I'd  consider a awesome day out. Why yes, practically ancient, I am.) \n3) Like your sly wit. \n4) Like Baking With Layton, lots. I tend to doubt things will turn out, but hey, I'm wrong quite a bit. : )\n5) You and Hazel, in a collaboration is a win every time, for me, at least. \n\nCheers, and here's to your health!
We will all miss you greatly. Please don't be so hard with yourself. Coming from someone who is extremely unforgiving of themselves. You never failed at making me happy. I loved to hear your options on matters across the world. Take care. You'll do incredible things. 🖤
dont feel bad. everyone here loves you.
I am so so happy you made this video. Ive always loved your channel, and I come to it for comedy and reality and funny stories and true human moments between you and the people you love, and I completely agree that you haven't seemed like yourself. Personally I think you should go and travel for a bit. Two weeks in Italy or something, reset your brain and change your surroundings and come back fresh and inspired. I can't wait till your passion flows through again. Love always x ❤️
dude, fail away. it's fine. it's also not entirely true. come back.
Personally I watch your videos for you and your personality. I love your perspective and opinions, even if we don't necessarily agree. I just find you so very engaging and charismatic that I would literally watch you do anything; you could be painting a wall or building furniture and I'd find the conversation funny and captivating. \n\nJust don't stop being you.
Daily videos seem very unrealistic anyway, honestly don't beat yourself up about it! You do you!
I believe in you, because I've been watching your vids for years and have seen so much good come from them, so I know lurking somewhere are some pretty damn cool, creative ideas. I'm looking forward to seeing them whenever that may be. Good luck! Breaks are super important, especially for creative tasks.
LOL u sux (kidding). There's nothing more demotivating as a creative person than when you hit a wall head on like one of those crash dummies. Glad to see you're aware enough to say, Yeah this isn't working for me. I'll regroup, then hit the ground running, rather than stressing yourself out trying to hit a deadline. \nNote: Amount of times I said, hit in this one comment = 4
You have not failed.  You learned, you grew, and gained experience to carry with you into further creative endeavors.  You're doing just fine!  Take what time you need; we'll be here when you're ready to come back.  <3
failure is one step closer to growing. i'm glad your taking time for yourself, that's important :)
One thing that's helped me a lot as an artist has been to realize that nothing is really failure if you learn from it. It's the opportunity to look back and learn, and move forward. All is forward motion and growth. To be honest, generally my biggest failures have been being overly worried about making something great and not being there fast enough. But it's okay if you're not there yet. Set out to learn and every step from there can be some kind of a victory.\n\nAlso, I really loved your vlog about getting excited about being a creator while doing set lists with Dodie. You sounded so happy.
I have no idea what VEDO is, and I've never seen any of your videos before, other than this one. After watching this I would suggest doing something you enjoy, and stick with it, develop it. No business succeeds without a plan (and I'm assuming since you said you do this full time, that this is a business). If you don't have a plan, just don't do it....... there's only so many times you can wing it. Good luck!
Whether you manage to make a video every day for a month or not, I enjoy the content you put out and I appreciate the fact that  you care about its quality!
Fair enough, no stress 😊 Take your time, we’ll still be here when you’re ready ❤️
I completely accept this and I hope that you find what you're looking for.  That being said, I already miss your videos.  Thank god I can watch your old ones <3  \nAnd you're not a failure, Dan.  You're a person who wasn't happy with your work.  There's nothing wrong with striving for something you can be proud of.
You didn’t fail, you just figured out that vlogging everyday isn’t what you want to do. Personally you’ve been one of my favorite youtubers for a long time and all of your videos ( even the ones about game of thrones which I know nothing about) have all been amazing and interesting. Even if vlogging everyday isn’t for you that’s alright and I’ll still continue to look forward to you’re uploads no matter how long they take. You shouldn’t try to please everyone, all that matters is that you’re pleasing yourself with the content you are uploading. :)
Time is a great healer. Take it and cherish it. I’m sure you’ll find your voice and comfort somewhere in between. I have been watching your videos for a while now and have always admired how articulate you are when it comes to relaying how you feel. What you do is brilliant because its genuine. Don’t beat yourself up my friend. I look forward to your future videos and wish you all the best...
with inktober going around I saw a great piece of advice. \ndaily challenges are supposed to help you feel good about yourself. at the end you want to feel satisfied that you did something challenging, not exhausted because you did something overwhelming. with inktober the advice is to reduce scale. instead of doing a whole full page illustration, instead make a one inch by one inch square and do that every day. \nI don't know what the equivalent of a one inch square is in video production, but it's an idea worth experimenting with. \n\nalso you're not a failure, and I super enjoyed the chilled out rambley vlogs about not much, and I hope you find what you need to maintain your happiness, and I would offer to fight anybody who says you're failing. I wouldn't actually fight them because IRL I'm bundle of fear of confrontation and misplaced anger in a wheelchair, but I'd offer it.
If I may, your initial attempt and intention to create in and of itself is an act of courage. You did not fail, I think, because I believe that the crux of a video everyday project such as vedo is the form that a desire to create may or may not take. I think that your intention, perhaps calculated, is more valuable than the result you achieved. And I think it should be framed as an achievement because you did create. You did tell stories. You did produce pieces of work that captured portions of your life and that is a meaningful truth regardless of their quantity. I like you because you are Daniel J. Layton. I'm thankful that you create. I will be here when you are happy to come back to this space.
Dear Daniel J Layton,\nLast night I had a dream about you. In the dream I was going to a play and you and your friends were there also. I was initially so excited to see Hazel and Jack and Dodie because I have been watching them for a long time. By the end of the play, I set out to find them. I found them behind the the building and said hi. Then I was looking amongst the group and I couldn't find you. Eventually I found you standing in the back, alone because you thought no one wanted to see you. But, I wanted to. I said hello to you and you hugged me and we had a lovely chat like we were old friends that just hadn't seen each other in a while. I know it was just a dream but that's how I feel when I watch your videos. I feel like they are the warm embrace of a good friend. I liked you VEDO so don't say no one wanted to watch it because I did. You can do this, my friend. I believe in you and what you can do.
The reason I love your videos is because there're always so honest and you're so honest and honestly you're just a fantastic human being and I love every second of watching you! So just keep making videos like this if you feel like it, share your feelings, then we shall share our love <3
If you're not having fun, we're not having fun. One of the best lessons any type of creator can learn.
Like a shitty sequel, it's rare you can recreate that magic - maybe try something new :))
‘Failure’ isn’t necessarily a bad thing to do. The meaning of failure is ambiguous, and can sometimes be the best thing that can happen to someone. Don’t shy away from failure, how will you ever have the motivation to achieve if you’ve never failed? Even if you feel you’ve failed, awesome! Look at all the constructive criticisms you can give yourself right now! Think of what amazing things can happen out of failure! GO CREATE WITH ABANDON AND TRIP UP ALONG THE WAY!!!! xxxx
Taking some time to figure things out is a really beneficial thing. I hope you find a conclusion that gives you peace in what you're doing.
Kick some arse while you're gone! Your own I guess? Stay safe and healthy x
I'm the absolute worse at ordering food at a restaurant. Too many options. I always have to start with what I definitely don't want. You're pairing down your channel's menu and figuring out what kind of space this is. Chronically where you're out, who you are, and trying to grow from that. Learning what you funny want. With so much learning happening, how can it be failure?
I actually really liked your videos in october. They weren't the most thought out videos sure, but I enjoyed them. I think it's ok if you decided to stop with those, especially if you yourself didn't like them. And you're certainly not a failure. Hope you have a nice day!
There've been quite a few comments on whether or not people, including yourself believed that you have failed, but what I think is more important is the idea that we need to reframe failure as a concept to be used as a creative tool. There have been many people that have said that failure is a critical part of the creative process and because failure is seen as bad by society, creativity in many ways has died because instead of trying something new and learning from it, we tend to hide within ourselves and don't take on those risks. \n\nIn attempting VEDO, you did try something that many creative artists will do in that of recreating the original outcome because it not only worked, but it was enjoyable to do. This, however, is a concept that I know many authors will go through with their second novel. They try to recreate the formula that worked the first time because it is familiar and it worked. This does lead to issues with the content itself because no moment can directly emulate another, it is an impossible standard that we so strongly desire to be feasible. \n\nBut I also believe that if this is a failure, it is definitely one that can be learned from. From a creative stand point, failure needs to be an option to have truly great art. That, plus the fact that as you develop your abilities, the process is linear while your taste and knowledge of your ability might be well beyond that. It is through failure that we learn what we are capable of and what we want to see in ourselves. You just have very high standards, something I really enjoy about your content, and I'm glad you opened up a conversation about failure as it is something that desperately needs attention in the creative world. \n\n(Also, you should check out Sir Ken Robinson. He has a lot to say on the subject)
It’s good to take some time to think. \nI hope you come out better on the other side.
dan, we've heard this before. pull yourself out of it and just make something wild. stop thinking so much
You did better then me, I got to announcing I'll do vedo thinking it would help me sort things out and had no plans since it worked during vedim, yet also means that I had no ideas and just didn't upload because I didn't want to upload shitty content again after starting to improve
Take your time and I hope you find the answers you're looking for. xxx
It’s okay! I’m failing VEDO, too! I’ve been in a really messy headspace and I just can’t be bothered and I know how you feel. I started it thinking that it would give me some sort of structure, thus being beneficial for my mental health. But I’m proud of you for putting yourself and your work first. Making content that is worth being watched is a tricky thing to determine. You are not a failure. You’re figuring it out. That sounds like personal progress to me. 💖 all the love to you and your videos. I love every single one.
I can't believe you've been full-time on here for 6 months already! I wouldn't say you failed, Dan. Every challenge and video you post is a learning/growing experience. The VEDO videos were wonderful and we're all here for whatever you'll bring to the table :)
This is probably gonna drown in all the lovely comments that you didn't fail, but I have something to add: you learned something. I think it is easy to see that you're a person who always wants to improve themself and become a better person!! You are learning and growing and you've realized that you need some time to find your voice on youtube again! That is very valuable and in the end a good thing cause you'll come out of it a stronger and more defined person, it is always hard to see in the beginning of a process, but you did not fail here!!!! You reflected and found something out about yourself and your job situation and had the strenght to say that this was not the way you want it to be! I really don't see the failure, be kind to yourself <3
Thanks for this video and speaking your mind! I can really relate to it since I'm trying my best to smash out a video every day too. Luckily, to me at the moment, it feels more like when you did VEDA. But I do worry that I won't be able to keep it up and keep up the creativity. I worry that I will be uploading just 'for the sake of it'. Your advice has really helped and I know that I can (and should) take a step back if needed. Take it easy, and I look forward to your return! :)
Take care of yourself Daniel! Your own health is your first priority. I absolutely love your channel and your videos, but I am a firm believer in quality, not quantity. If you're not happy then stop, take a break, think and start again. There's is no shame in that what so ever. Also, my favorite videos of yours are the ones where you just sit down and rant about random subjects. That to me is quality material.\nI love you, please take care of yourself.\nAlso here's a quote that might help:\nEver tried? Ever failed? No matter. Try agin. Fail again. Fail better. (Samuel Beckett)
Still think your vids are exceptionally well written and funny. You are also very articulate in the way you speak, mate. It’s your style 👍
You make things that you feel happy with if you end up uploading a video a week, every two weeks whenever people will still love you and watch you. Your PMS videos are amazing and so is Baking with Layton. Basically all I want to say is if you feel that you failed or think that you failed because you didn't upload a video everyday that is okay everyone fails at things because even the Undertaker fails at things and look at him he is a fucking legend and in my horrible less than 20-20 eyes you are amazing and a god damned legend. <3<3

I also failed oops
Best of luck <3
I can be quite bad at remembering to take my antidepressants, and my mum can tell within a day if I have forgotten to take them. I'm generally quite a chill person, quick witted and love to be a giant nerdy goofball. But I become so angry and withdrawn when I forget to take them, I zone out a lot and can't control my emotions. \nIt really does mess with your brain to suddenly deprive your brain of the chemicals it's become accustomed to. Especially when you have commitments and responsibilities to attend to.
I have never put Ribena in water, ever! They sell it in juice bottles, like Minute Maid, and CC Lemon at 7 Eleven's and other convenience stores like it, i've never heard of anyone drink it like that in HK
I kind of want to hear Phil's perspective on living with someone who has depression and just  generally what it's like to have someone you care about go through mental illness. I can only see it from Dan's perspective so  I think learning what it's like from an outside perspective would be interesting.
i can only watch livestreams once they're finished so i can double the speed. I need my procrasitnation to be dense enough to distract me completely
Australians also have this! T(e cordial thing
This has 19 on trending well done dan.
How the hecky dizzle did this get on trending????
I've never related to someone so much. I love that you addressed this. I've been struggling with depression for about two years now and I've been to therapy. Personally, it doesn't work all that well for me. My therapist continuously tells me that I should try medication but I don't know if I should. I have a friend who said that she doesn't like it because it makes her feel like she's being controlled and not in control. That's my main reason for refusing medication. I also don't want to depend on it. But this stream made me want to try to continue therapy. I just want to say I admire you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you
Watch Train to Busan ! It's a first Korean zombie film and it's actually really good and makes you feel feels ;-;
sorry but dan looks so cute in this liveshow. in fact, he looks amazing all the time smsksksksk
anybody else really want to do his eyebrows
My mental health is all over the place, I need a therapist. But I'm also dealing with chronic pains that have not been officially diagnosed as any actual chronic disease which is horrible because it means I can't get proper treatment and I just end up on tons of meds all the times. The meds, of course, make me sick. Now I might eventually become at risk of liver failure, kidney failure, and/or an ulcer. Yay health problems!
I WISH TØP WAS LIKE YOU GUYS AND NEW STUFF DAMN
The sound of styrofoam rubbing against itself, everything about chalk and the taste of celery make me want to throw up
your thumb nail was beautiful!!! don`t let anyone tell you any different!!!
why is this on the trending page???i want to be on the trending page too
s o f t  d a n i e l
Here in Mexico, we don't talk that much about mental health, everyone is like get over it and stuff, so they literally make you keep your feeling the most inside you can, so it's really hard, for me at least, because my parents are like, really sceptical when something has to be with mental illness...so yeah it's hard in other countries
Okay so Dan in this video reminds me of a young Roland Orzabal from Tears for Fears
Why did I think Ribeana (idk how to spell it) was some type of alcoholic drink. Kinda like wine lol.
I think living in an environment where people around you don't understand what depression is, or what it's like for someone going through a mental issue, sometimes makes me feel like a freak or the all the things people call me. Seeing people describe the same feelings or experience you went/ or are going through makes me feel okay. Thank you Daniel for beung honest and showing people that fighting and holding on is worth it. **Sorry for my grammar**
Omg thanks for streaming on my 13th birthday!!
Please play any of the legend of zelda games!!!
i literally had to pause the video right after he had thrown shade at felix to breathe lmao
I Dont even know who most of these gayboys are on Trending
Have you seen the new Blade runner ?it is so good
I am doing chores while my husband is ignoring me on minecraft 😂🙃
HOW IS A LIVE STREAM IN T R E N D I N G AHH
Dan you are such a beautiful human being and we all love you ❤
IT MAKES ME EVEN MORE SAD THAT EVERYONE YELLED AT HIM TO TELL US ABT THIS OMFF
Dans voice is so soothing tho I'm about to fall asleep stop that
Have you seen an anime called” Your Name Here” it is the BEST I have ever seen
Damn, how much revenue are you going to make on this video.
i love how during ads, dan looks annoyed in the corner while they play
dan and phil have been posting so much stuff recently like well then
Wait what video is the lady door thing from?
The same thing happened to me. I get awful withdrawal symptoms when I ran out of citalopram !
I saw the new blade runner on Saturday and it's the best movie I've ever seen!!! And I am not joking, it was so amazing I hardly have words for it.
I don't have ribena in the U.S. as far as I know (in Florida at least), but I W A N T it
sugary fruit syrup I think the words ur looking for are artificial fruit juice ALSO Fuck yes robinsons squash is my life
I want to be a therapist when I’m older, so that video and this one was very interesting and educational. I have a friend in therapy (because of personal issues that I’m not gonna get into) and so I feel like those videos are going to help me relate to her more. Thanks for doing what you do, and using it how you do! I love you SOOO much!!! ♥️♥️
Does his arm get tired or waaa
Everytime Dan talks about BTS, a part of my soul goes to heaven.
This is so not the real dan 😂😂 He is just coping the livestreams . So stupid 😂😂
Goddamn this man is so cute and genuine
He protecc \n\n\nHe attacc \n\n\nBut most importantly \n\n\n\nHe Snugly as hacc\n\n(Im not even sorry for that)
Baking video predictions:\nAccidental innuendos\nEnds up looking like shit\nTastes amazing tho\nThis is orgasmic/I'm having an orgasm/etc.\nPhil trying to be positive about the end product but we all know and he knows its a flop\nSpoopy\nRandom singing and dancing\nWeird transitions
The 'Dan and depression' Vid was your best ever in my opinion. It was so relatable to me and I'm sure a lot of people thought, if even Dan has depression and isn't afraid to talk about it or admit it, I also don't have to be. So, big thanks from germany :)
when he first mentioned marzia i was like oh my god are they still friends with pewdiepie but then he was like might have a chat with a certain swedish person\nyeah boiii u tell him!!
Very important question: is marching band considered a sport?
Daniel your eyebrows are a messy kind of cute
ryden trash is in the bath
I WAS TERRIFIED BY THE ORANGE SKY I WALKED OUT OF SCHOOL AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE “ITS THE END OF THE WORLLDDDDD”
I CANT LIVE WITHOUT ROBINONS SUMMER FRUITS
Forgot my meds this morning and this vid made me realise oops!!!! Making myself a sticky note bc this happens too often ugh
Respect for doing that man x
u r only hat jak paul for his wiveslol yu have no subbies
let's start using peace more
you are the best background warbble
He is so good looking in this
Dude your smile is so pure and I love it 😍
So squash or ribena is basically like « sirop » for any french or Swiss or wherever people speak French and have that
How do I find out who I am?
Dan, thank you for doing something that I could never do. I wish I could have been at the live stream, but I could relate to this and your previous video. I, unfortunately, don't have access to therapy or anything like that so I'm kind of screwed in that department, but I do have a guidance councillor that I talk to all the time so not totally screwed? Sorry, rambling. Anyway, thank you for making that video and opening up about it
The us has that too. It's called Mio here
Dan says : dont stop taking your medication!\nAnd Chris Oflyng says : medication is horrible, stop it \nSo ??
Is it sad how pleased I am this is 13 on trending
It hurts when he says bye 😣😂
Please don’t ever say your career was a mistake. It has made me very happy to watch yours and Phil’s videos. I would be very sad without them.
I hate that you had to experience this, and I hope you never have to again.

You can’t spell DANK without DAN.
This really makes you wonder how close Dan and Phil are that Phil is willing to stick around all the time and help Dan through his problems... I suppose he DOES eat a lot of Dan's cereal as payment...

Both Feminism & AntiFeminism are words with more than one meaning. Both labels have ppl going by them who believe in civil equality of the sexes & those who do not.
This nigga LeBron the real life Mr Krabs
This is the best video of all-time
Coach Lou, can Dwade & I stack our beds on top of each? So much room for activities
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
who will be Cleveland's starting 5?
Best duo in nba history
that's a great question from Dwade about Cleveland. I'm from akron Ohio and stayed in the akron area. Never had i ever heard the term the land until right before the playoffs in 2016.
Who is LeBron James and Dwayne Wade
That bromance is a little sus s/o to them
It is said that Hazrat Dawood (A.S) Qoum of about 70,000 Prople lived near the bank of Sea aella . They were very happy. Allah examine them by ordering them not to do fishing on saturday.\nhttp://www.islam360.ga/2017/10/how-12000-human-beings-turned-into.html
Am I coming off The Bench tonight? I don't know! Ask Coach #The Hiker (Movie African)

Rachel was about to start some drama after LeBron made that kid comment, but Wade curved that shit & switched the subject lmaooo veteran move
aww it's crazy. lebron james i had dated many guys whom didnt have a father figure in their lives. it's crazy but true
Dwayne wade like I came here for another ring..
They are so funny 😂
I hear so much shit about Lebron and Wade getting old that I forget they’re only in their 30s.  They look young and energized in this video

Happy these two are reunited
In sync best friend shit right there \n\n3:48 and 5:10
She looks like she wants some
Wade is Lebron's little bitch for life
These two are definitely fucking. Wade is a disloyal bitch for going to Cleveland. Miami should burn his Jersey.
Aww they look so happy together, is gay marriage legal in Ohio? 🤔
Dwyane Wade? Fuck that.\n\nThere's only room for one black guy called Dwyane in my life - Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson.
Seeing these two duo is a breath of fresh air! 🔥👑
Kyrie a kid facts if you disagree then you suck dick simple end of story
Good stuff I like the chemistry pretty funny the way wade just crashing at your place awesome
Fakest person I’ve ever seen glad he’s 3 out of 8 in the finals

Rappers could learn a lot from athletes about friendships.
Peanut butter is consistent, it don't miss games, - Dwade 2017

Guess what? I found a site that's giving Boost Mobile reboost codes away for free!  http://ow.ly/KsKF30dCmoK
If you live long enough folks make sure you have a dwade to your LeBron James.
Lebron is a bitch and Wade is a bitch too. Fuck Lebron...suck some shit you bitches! Sounds like she is interviewing a gay couple.
I don’t know about y’all, but jelly on toast w/o the peanut butter is delicious. You can DEFINITELY have a jelly-only sandwich, D.Wade. Also, LeBron, if your peanut butter is dry, you’re not doing it right LOL. Great interview, Rachel!
Retire. Give young men a chance to play
Battle of the Hairlines

Fake sports news
Wades hair looks great!
I seriously have watched this about 7 times😂😂
This is the ultimate bromance going
Don't let this distract from the fact LeBron James had to leave an NBA finals game against the Spurs because of a leg cramp!
Gayinthenba
rejected racecar drivers gone wild!
Atleast nobody disrespected the flag.
Ah I see, they're rednecks.
The crowd is disgusting. They cheer when one man purposefully endangered another's life.
I was like damn....they them fight like in hockey. Until I seen the  cop come In.
*Apparently he had dreams of being a monster truck driver*
How is he going to drive with his hands handcuffed in his back ?
I think maybe he didn't plan on getting stuck on top of the car hahah
The policeman should be arrested for trespassing on the track
Who the eff is that girl screaming like seriously calm down nobody died.
What will ferrell movie is this clip from again?
Hahaha he tasered him with gas and oil leaking everywhere. This could have become a much bigger story.
Prooobably didn't need to smash into his car. Probably.
What the guy in the black car did was pretty much vehicular assault, perhaps attempted murder. The man who got shot with the stun gun and handcuffed had full right to be upset at the driver of the black car for potentially having killed him.
One of the best fights ever as u don't see any fucking great keeping it pg
what in the bucknekked hee haw tarnation is going on here???
Lol if nascar was more like this than it would be much more exciting
This is what happens when you pay people a bunch of money to win games
LMAO, THEY'RE RETARDED IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR ACTUALLY THINKING THIS IS A SPORT.
Well. Nice to know there’s unprofessional asshats throughout society I guess
you know that CSI reverse camera angle bullshit? - how do we use it here? LoL!
Both drivers should be arrested and the driver in the car that ran over 33 banned from racing.
Why are people screaming like crazy in the audience wtf... stop it...
I'm surprised the cop didn't kill em.
im impressed the black car was able to drive up onto the other one 10/10 would watch again
Well, they did sign up to put on a show.
I think car 33 is going to need an oil change.
Basketball: pretend to get tripped and ref lets you win game\nRacecars: Smash someone elses car and they get tased and arrested\nHmmmmmmmm
Lmao fucking rednecks. Ricky Bobby and his buddy are at it again. Shakin and bakin baby
Y'all wild this is lit!! 😂
So the dude almost died from that guy almost Crushing him with the car, so obviously the guy was gonna kick his ass
At the dirt track this happens everytime
That cop wasn't having that nonsense!
Didn't know monkeys could drive cars and attend car races in the US
I bet the bald one told him look what you made me do, ouuu.
If it was NASCAR he will be dead   That guy is so fat he need 2 hand cuff
Lmao! Probably the funnest part of the night.
*This video's the perfect example of why Formula 1 Racing is for idiots!*
the other driver got cuffed to 4:53
stupid motorsports made in US
Hey cops, do this the next time Antifa or Black Lives Matter members open their mouths.
Idiot screaming female in the background was very annoying.
F'n tards, both of them.
The fighting is more entertaining than the race.
Why is everyone so pissy?? This was hilarious! 😂
So why don't the Arrest NASCAR Drivers when they do this?
20 years ago they would have just separated them. That driver definitely deserved an ass beating.
Wow! This is crazy is that who we are now, instead of giving them a hand we throw a punch, this isn't funny at all. God please help us, we need Jesus in our life.
He took his job!
Soo only baseball, basketball, and football players can fight on the field with no repercussions. I'd like to see that happen on a NFL field.
What the hell was that dumbass in the black car trying to do. Deserved to get his ass beat
I'm ashamed of my country
These same people yell and scream that other races are violent.
white trash at its finest .... everyone in the crowd is included ....
Guide Lamp has been gone for years, but the cheering trash remains. Wonder if they keep The Lamplighter in business.
who the fuck is screaming? why the fuck?
Rednecks watching other rednecks destroying each other's property and beating the shit out of each other. Only thing missing is someone fucking their cousin in a corner and we'd have the perfect Redneck paradise.
Hell yeah, tasing is racing
dats sum ricky bobby shit!
someone is screaming
Jerry was a racecar driver...
These guys are disrespectin' 'Merica!!!
Well that escalated quickly....;)
‘Murica
Muriccaaaa
Typical Trump supporter
This is so fucking cringe
Stupid Show
He deserved a beating
mad max
aaaand 1 more time around
Barbarians!
Stupid rednecks....
Trailer park spawn.
hillbillies
Вы тупые пипец
‘Merica
MEDIOCRE
They were both hammered.
1:22
Dumb
Don't tase me bro
Murica
酷
idiots being idiots.
Retards
Great camera angle 😊😑
Mario Karts gone wild
“Only I can fuck my cousin, you cuck!”
Why are there so many anti redneck comments?
Taser's are effective.
Publicity stunt. They should work for CNN they faked that so well.
People pay money to watch this crap? The fight was the only entertainment till the rent a cop spoilt the fun.
First thought, not much of a track compared to Winchester. Second thought, 0:29 not much of a race... 1:22 lol well that's better. Third thought, try in two more times from same angle I want to see if that's luck or just skilled parking.
proudly brought to you by the dan halen sheetrock and drywall company.
I can't decide who the bigger pussies are; the cop who waddles in and goes straight for the taser, or the six guys standing there waiting for a lone cop to break it up.\n\nJesus Christ, just pull him off. They're redneck wannabe race car drivers,  not X-Men.
Most exciting thing to happen to this sport since Ricky Bobby....
Just turn Anderson and Kokomo into landfills.
OOF
This garbage is trending but iDubbbz's 'Content Cop' on Asian Jake Paul wasn't.
Mani is fucking beautiful! Marry me bish1!!!

don't know if TRL will work in this era but we'll see
There only 4 of them
Who is this hot guy on blue sweatshirt?! What the fuck is his name?!!?! Can someone tell me!!?
This is basically Pussycat Dolls revived, but with new body-material. It's like the member of PD said, a week ago, about their own group in the past - when a producer wanted to have sex with them, they needed to submit, none of the girls had the right to refuse, or else she would be thrown out the group.\nPeople like Weinstein must be really happy in the industry. ;) A whole new merchandise is at their disposal. I felt this would happen to Fifth Harmony since the very first sexual music videos of theirs. Promoting them on shows like this is just another producers' stunt. I won't be fooled by the industry any more. I'm quitting listening to music like this. Period. I want to let real artists and talents to become famous. It's the only way. Those sexual bimbos just won't do, I'm sorry. Just my opinion.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
Their new stylist deserves an award. Trust me!\nAlso, Lauren laughing at her own answer. lol\nShe always finds herself funny and it's cute. She is one of a kind.
TRL-Struggling to be relevant and promote a bs be yourself in an industry that makes robots and sex icons ideal. Should have stayed dead. Take pop music with you on the way out!
Dumb and dumber and the ZOMBIES who follow follow follow
It's not trl without Carson Daly like back in the days.
The wildest Night was the last night and It was Costa Rica 🇨🇷 and I was there! 😭
i am so mad i missed this
Let’s where red and black and not tell Normani
TRL is tryna be a thing again?
Being that close...like face to face with them?? I'd pass out or throw up 😂😊😂
Yoooo the light skin girl with braids was on DWTS talking about Vote for Normani right 😂
the quality of these videos is amazing thank you!
This video needs some bleach!!
I was waiting for someone to ask if camren is real.
Always interesting to see how Lauren is going to act when it comes to playing games 😆
When did they bring back TRL?
22k views and 100 comments and it's trending. Ok, must have some trump hate in the video somewhere.
can i just give a big thank you to ally's stylist she looks so good
TRY is back? Since when?
How long is TRL been on I thought it got cancelled
If I ever meet them,now I know to bring Dinah hot Cheetos
Fuck YouTube trending page came out yesterday and has 22 k views and 5th on trending. Stop trying to make trl a thing again
Aff Não tinha um corajoso pra peguntar se Camren is real
This has barely any views... trending page is so rigged
Lauren I love you
dinah and her hot cheetos have a better love story than i do
Marrying Normani

They're all so adorkable! :p
x\nXxi\n😍😎
No one asked if they miss camila 🙂
So when are the artists with actual personality coming on TRL?
I got an STD just watching this!
1) Who?\n2) TRL still exists?\n3) When did MTV start playing music again?\n4) Headbangers ball or fuck you.
I just realized how Lauren has the same or very similar laugh Selena Quintanilla had 😭
Fifth Harmony is ugly
Nobody watches trl & MTV
İllərdi bunu heç kim görmədi ? Nəsə burda qaranlıq məsələ var.....
Thanks for the new! This vulnerability is very important/dangerous!
can older version leser than wpa_supplicant 2.4 be used?
thank you very much to discover such flaw in wifi security before evil hacker discovered i aware people about this flaw in wifi security
so , the attacker got internet access?
thank you master! time to hack my crush
back to the RJ45 xD
any one knows when will the code be released??
This was fixed on android 6+ with the august security patch - at least in my testing
Create A Fake AP and talk with Client Device to achieve 4 way handshake, we have already done. what is new in it??? OR are you just want to get popularity over web with this ???
Subscribe To My Channel Guys :)
can you please provide these tools? I need to check my whole network in office and home.
he says ...update all of your wifi devices. does this include wifi routers/access points or only the devices (clients) that connect to a network over wifi, e.g. smartphone, printer, roku, desktop, tv, yada yada??
That is very good research. Thanks for your effort to correct the loopholes in android and Linux.\nData would be still encrypted by SSL, if users carefully visit the websites by checking the HTTPS and Certificates(certificate issuer must be trusted CA). If website request received without SSL(HTTPS) then do not provide information.
amazing man! can you improve that method?
If I understand this correctly, you are connecting the victim to the rogue WiFi network, so you don't break the WPA2 encryption in real. You just forced the victiom phone to connect to the rogue WiFi without the victim knowing and then intercepting the packets as MItM attack. OR?
Which linux distribution you using plz tell
All your Wifi base are belong to us !
we fucked up to the mother :v
Does anyone know what distro of Linux this is? #cheers
Whats version Linux in video ? Please!
I don't have WiFi anymore, got an unlimited 4G data plan
Nice. Now they need to release their exploit or someone else will do it.
i think its fine
So what im i suppose to update and where?
I lost it when this guy knows soooo much about computer security but still uses Simple Screen Recorder LMAOO
its cool and at the same time scary for me who uses a custom rom
OLD NEWS. Get with the times
By 'updating your devices' what does the author mean? What specifically I should update on my Android phone and Laptop?
Apple are patching it in a FEW WEEKS.... R.I.P. Wifi
You've discovered the NSA's backdoor.
Glad this is on trending.
I don't know wtf is going on but this is trending so I like it
What's this about ? Can someone explain ?
Time to have fun!!
This is extremely serious and everyone should be made aware of this major vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol affecting all WiFi devices I know of.
nigga am i fucked right now please answer is everyone fucked?
:(:
lol fuck
Android y sus parches al ataque.
Excellent work, Mathy. And pretty nice video explaining how it is done (usually i dont really get it what is happening, but here i could almost completely follow and understand the steps) and what can be hijacked by exploiting the issue -> workaround: do not use unencrypted end-to-end protocols in the meanwhile until WPA(2) is fully fixed :) . Nice research, hope you´ll get your deserved donations after finding such a trivial implementation issue on a (for a long time) stated secure protocol and help on getting a safer internet for the world. I cannot believe that no one had yet discovered that issue - at least no one made it public....
https://youtu.be/8klSYoMnYGM check this out
anyone else really confused what's going on here and only clicked on this video because it was on trending??
is the .py script open source?
Why is YouTube promoting this? WTF DOES THIS MEAN GOOGLE? Fuck this. I'm moving to IOS. Cunts.
Where can I get these files
so that means hacker could check all my porn data files????
So..... how do I protect?
alguien que me explique en español como funciona esto?? o es solo un alerta que se puede hacer cagar los wpa2? si se pùede me explican?
Where are those people who been telling that linux is the most secure system in the world? lol
Where are shadow brokers

Goodbye wpa2, welcome wpa3
Q:A\nQ: Can I have a copy of this script?\nA: No. It is illegal (federal offense) to hack any private/public network.\n\nQ: RIP WPA2\nA: WPA2 is not dead. You will just need to patch your iPhone, Android, macbook, PC, or gaming console.\n\nQ: Nooooooooooooooooooo\nA: It's not the end of the world. See answer above.\n\nQ: I use WPA1 or WPA am I safe?\nA: You are even more at risk. No you're not safe\n\nQ: I only ever use iPhone and Macs. I don't need to worry.\nA: WRONG. You are still at risk. Please patch all Apple devices, along with your AP (router)\n\nQ: I thought Apple was immune to viruses?\nA: This isn't a virus, it's an exploit to steal/forge your WiFi data being sent/received\n\nQ: I use VPN. No need to worry\nA: That's funny, no really it is. You're not safe, but keep telling yourself that if it helps.\n\nQ: Please, I use Linux... No one is more safe than me.\nA: ... WRONG... If you believe that, then maybe Linux isn't the right OS for you.

Oh shit this is a real problem
for all the people saying wpa2 is dead. ALL the kracks attacks on linux can be patched right now. so the only victim left are android devices and i think they will be patched soon. so wpa2 is not dead yet.
take this down
someone did it to me
where can i get my hands on the krack tool ?
Script?
What must we do?
WEP is not secure...\nWPA2 is not secure too...\nnow, what's the secure protection?\ndo we have to get new protection system?
HI BROTHER, IM A TEACHER OF TECNOLOGY AN I WANT IF IS POSSIBLE WHAT YOU WILL CAN BORROWME YOUR TOOL FOR A CLASS ABOUT THE WIRELESS SECURITY..\nBEFORE OF ALL THANKS FOR YOUR ATENTTION
Sorry what is this about ? I’m Russia. And drunk 😵  but I still don’t know what On going here?
No offence but this has been easy to do since 2004 why is this on trending now? Either me and my cronies are far far ahead of this current generation or your video is an already well known thing.
What if the routers we have are from our ISP and the updates comes like one update per 5 years!!!!
Script??
For everyone to know *this video is from 2012*
Storm Ophelia just blew the roof of my local football (soccer) pitch!
All these celebrities that have been SOOO full of virtue were ALL complicit with the sexual deviancy of Holywood. They all knew what was going on and did nothing until someone else had the balls to speak up. Actors and musicians = Hypocrites! ...Golywood is DEAD to me now.
Number one on trending in UK is a fat pervert standing next to a road talking to two women........fantastic
if body language is anything to go by shes incredibly aroused &displaying sexual interest in a) Weinstein.. or b) the tall black bodyguard behind him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor her sake i hope its the bodyguard :/
THIS WAS FUCKING 2012, SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW BACK THEN!!!
There are actual atrocities being commited the world over and this bollocks makes the news. People actors and actresses couldnt be more full of shit.
Vid ends at 1:15 thank me in money.
Showbiz types hug.  It's insincere and means nothing. Hence the term air kiss.  If you think everyone who puts their arm around a  showbiz colleague actually likes them you're beyond naive.  I believe Weinstein's wife was present here too. This clip invites the usual suspects falling over themselves to suggest this exchange is meaningful in any way and we get the usual misogynistic epithets being so casually expressed. Depressing stuff.
Alot more harvey shitstains still out there, they must be pulling some serious favours with the media tycoon's, who of course are also upto no good, so much for the media lmao,The  Lamestream Media's day's are numbered.
Must be true then I mean what’s not to believe when its coming from an ex junkie who was probably of her face at the time.
This video shows nothing incriminating, just Harvey looking like a creepy old man
FFS SHE IS LITERALLY SMILING AND LAUGHING WHAT IS WRONG IN THAT OMG IT WAS IN 2012 TOOOOOO
The only reason an attractive woman would ever touch or flirt with a fat and disgusting man is if she's after his money.\n\n\n\nI know this from experience.
Paedophile who travelled from Southall to Slough to meet a 13 year old girl is caught...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqD2CDI84z8
HARVEY THE DOUCHEBAG GOT AWAY WITH ALL THIS STUFF FOR SO LONG. I BET HE SAID SOMETHING TO UPSET THE ZIONISTS WHO CONTROL HOLLYWOOD SO THEY HAVE EXPOSED HIM TO RUIN HIM. WHAT GOES AOUND COMES AROUND, THATS JUSTICE. HE WAS SCREWING PEOPLE THAT DIDNT WANT IT, NOW HE IS GETTING SCREWED AND DOESNT WANT IT
Why is this on trending if it was uploaded over 5 years ago?
GUYS THIS VID IS FROM 2012
This is fucking old I'm Suprised That this is Trending
A lot of women gained their fame by being nice.. their Masters didn't mean it would be a 1 time deal though.\n#GoodOleDays
OMG fuck off with this shit it's all over the news we don't need it to be trending we get it! he's a bad person! sick of hearing about this guy.
How is this 1st in trending
He’s good \nBut he’s not quite jimmy savile
Yeah but when was this?
Any context? When was this filmed?
Okay this guy abused his power no doubt but got laugh at the sluts who willingly gave him what he wanted to not risk damaging their career. Obviously their dignity and self respect went out the window with some of them
Trying to reach 20k views I’m on 17k please help,me get views by watching my videos please 😆😆

Hos still want the Weinstein weiner guess it doesn't matter what you do as long as you're rich enough
I don't condone sexual abuse in any form, but why do all these women attack him now? Seems so opportunistic, he is a bag of dung well and truly but really are they any better than him for keeping this a secret for so long?
*The shit youtube make trending...*
How old is this though
YouTube's algorithm is awful. This should not be trending
Can not judge what happened by watching this.
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
God, Jessica is all bullshit, she's so hypocrite. My respect for courtney, she has the face of I don't wanna be here . But in the end of the day, she was there, so, her fault too.
YouTube is a shit platform
Harvey Weinstein may be an asshole but all those hollywood actresses are just lying fakes. They literally whore themselves for a role.\nOf course not they act all outraged on twitter because the dude served his purpose.\n\nFAKE WHORES.
Good to see him enjoying himself.
Hollywood whores will suck a small, circumcised kike cock for a role but cry rape when it suits them.\n\nHarvey Cum Shot for the Plant Pot Weinstein did nothing wrong even though he's a nasty kike.
Y’all know this clip is from 2012 right? Before any of Weinstein’s victims came out about any of the abuse? It’s really sad seeing all these people in the comments talking shit about Jessica, especially since it was BEFORE the allegations.
Have to be honest here, Jessica Chastain  is extremely over-rated as an actress & for a shit actress she is in so many big budget Hollywood films & as the open secrets in Hollywood are coming out on a daily basis, I can see how she has been cast in so many films, the mattress on her back helps, hence the uninvited hug for Weinstein.
WHY IS THIS NUMBER 1 ON TRENDING? WTF!
this is just now trending.... hmm
More proof the trending page is a waste of time.
🐰If you subscribe to me and i will  subscribe back 🐰plz 🐰
Why is this trending? They just stood their and did nothing. What was this video supposed to show?  I don't understand!
It's easy with all the women claim to be molested by Weinstein: you fuck me, you make me famous. That was the deal. Now they feel regret and claim sexual abuse. Gimme a fucking break. I hope the entire dregs get pulled up. Destroy Hollywood
Looks like he’s landed a 4some by promising lead roles for all of them #mogulpaedophile
why the hell 5 yo video is trending? wtf, YT broken again/still?
I am a single black Jamaican man. Looking for married. I have a fat long black dick for you single ladies. Just what's app me at. +18768127504

Pot calling the kettle black these dirty Hollywood perverts don't no if they are coming or going.that also includes these actresses coming forward where were you when he first did somthing why not go to the police like a normal person. You chose not to because you sold your self . Now when your other pervert masters have gone sour with Weinstein they have asked all the perverted actresses to step in all the same thing a bunch of dirty sexual preditors and hoes
I hate drump supporters they do shit like harvey weinstein did(rape women).. its cus of trumps attitude for women grab them by the pussy and how they can get away with this sh*t because they are rich. disgusting
video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
What's the point in this? Like he's surrounded by women. Omg what a sinner
0:54 - Damn that hug just screams desperation. So this basically proves most actresses prostitute themselves to rich producers just to get famous! \n\nHOLLYWOOD IS FULL OF GOLD DIGGING SLUTS JUST READY FOR THE CHANCE TO FUCK AND SUCK THEIR WAY TO THE TOP!
😲💩

DAMNNN BOIIII THAT WAS INSANE HOLY CRAPPP NO WAYYY :O
Wow he definitely did all those bad things people say! I mean look at this woman trying to escape his rapist grasp
The CIA is using this Weinstein drama to cover up Vegas.
Gross. Harvey may have raped some women, but think about the hundreds actresses who whored themselves out for movie roles and fame. Hollywood is so disgusting.
Now it makes you wonder did these actresses get to the top from their talent of acting or talent of sucking cock... 🤔🙈
So that's how Jessica Chastian climbed up the hollywood ladder
Casting Couch baby
It's impossible for me to watch this and not have the biggest smile on my face ❤️✨
Great performance from Alexandra. I wish she’d return to music . I miss her amazing voice and music.
LOL at all the jealous people disliking the video. I know the 'jealousy' card is overused but it's obvious in this case.
“All my ladies you can do it. You can do it even better in broken heels” LOVE ALEXANDRA!!!!
She can sing, she can dance, she's pretty, and she's unproblematic. Absolute travesty that she's not selling out stadiums all over the world
Bloody hell, that performance  was fire. I might just watch the series.
She’s on speed clearly
Brilliant 😁😁😁😁

Ok this is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen
She was tina here ..
She's so fast you can't even put a STOP Sign in front of her
No offence to Alexandra- she’s amazing, but I can’t help staring at Gorka. That man is beautiful....

I want her to win but strictly and dailymail have already decided to be Gemma. You can tell  by the way DM are trying to assassinate alexandra character and putting stories about her and gemma feuding over some guy.
B O N E L E S S T R E N D I N G
My jaw dropped when I saw this on TV !!! SHES SO GOD DAM GOOD
I'm not an Alexandra fan at all, but OMG can that girl dance. That was sensational, and the body on her. Absolutely fantastic
As a huge Tina Turner fan, she definitely did her proud!! Amazing!!
This is a great performance from Alexandra.
Best dance so far by a mile, no slips. She's joined the group of great jives up with Scott, Jill, Austin, Jay and Ore. 10.
THEY LOOK FAB! I'll be so upset if they don't win they are clearly the best
Who remembers the days when X Factor was better than Strictly ...
She is a star 🌟 she is bringing soul back to life! Love her! ♥️🤗 I hope she wins! 👍😎
Alexandra's mother would be so so proud of her...she looks amazing up there....
Hope she wins the show!
Addictive, can't stop watching it, that was superb. 👏🏽scd I agree routine was hot.
I think you will find that is proud Mary by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
My winner by far 😆😆💛💛💛
Woah! What A Dance! Enthusiasm Truly Seen! For Dancing A Song From The 2015 Group Dance Finale, And SHOCKING ME In The Start, I Give A Big Fat 100!
still living for this!!!!!!
*retrieves jaw from the ground*
ALEX BURKE!! YESS!!
hi
#1 on trend!
I love Strictly
gooD
Ohhhh dear me

1010101010!
She was great.
OMG
Good afternoon
By ccr not tina turner
Diva!!
Alex and gork, absolutely amazing, Sue 💞 🎶
1 on trending congratulations guys!!!
The footwork is incredible
what is dis
best evil dance ever seen... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Come on Tina , give her a call!
Thanks to the band and singers for keeping it tight...
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
I takes a lot for me to take my eyes off Gorka and she certainly did! Absolutely phenomenal dance, especially this early in the competition!
PRO ENTERTAINER BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING WELL WE NEVER SAW THAT COMING DID WE
That was awesome.  \nI might start watching this show now.
Her husband disliked the video 127 times
She’s an amazing dancer. But to pretend this is a 10 is misleading. She clearly has sickle feet. Aston (as much as I’m not a fan of his dancing, forcing as much hip hop moves in to the dance as possible), got railroaded for having pigeon toes. Not fair this was given a ten. But her energy was awesome and she is clearly the strongest dancer. Still a winner.
OMG I remember watching Alexandra win the X factor years ago when I was a kid! It's great to see her more!
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI
Song is by creedence clearwater revival...tina only covered it
John Fogerty was such a great songwriter.
Whoo who!!, That was fabulous!, I think I’m in love with this couple 👍 awesome job Alexander and Gorka
I can't believe they got 39 on week four
1like = your person of choice will win\nSubscribe=you’ll be on strictly
reminds e of Alesha and also Nathalie gummede    and all the fuss because shes ccouldnt t do her jive  to this song and she was the favourite at the time
Alexandra deserves to win this series! That's only if people stop voting for Ken & Barby!
My Grandma is obssessed with strictly come dancing
She's so sexy 😍😍
How to get Spotify Premium for free on my channel thoooo
Dont watch this video .... \nI repeat its a trap. Dont watch this video\nhttps://youtu.be/W7GY8HPG-pc
Go girl, you are killing it 💖💟
Look at the two of them go!
Trying to reach 20k views I’m on 17k please help,me get views by watching my videos please 😆😆
Can you sub me I need to get to 325 subscribers before my birthday 28th October it’s all I would like for my birthday! Besides giving my family more love for the next chapter of my life 💗💗💗
Her singing career didn't work out so she's doing this ahahah #fail
Cutest elephant ever!
She should do porn instead.
I don’t know why this got tens. She was so technique wise shit.
Riccardo Cocchi & Yulia Zagoruychenko  are the best!!!   Incomparable \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RZ2g8Kw198
One question, why did the BBC cut Alexandra hair in the thumbnail?🤔🤔🤔
why does she have different hair in the thumbnail?
Definitely a great performance from Alex and partner but I hope Craig was on his feet in disgust about them not sticking to the '10 second rule'!!!
I black who can Dance so what? \nWould anyone be surprised if a white invented flights to the sun?
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE! MY BIRTHDAY CAN I GET SOME SUBS PLEASE
Trouble is she ain't no amateur. West end show, coached by Craig, cheater!
Na the ex jls will be this years winner there just playingit down so he dont get top points every wk or there put him 2nd cors every one end up clocking what there up two in being winner all ready before end it all soz but no 3 tens for that i dont think so come on now
🐰If you subscribe to me and i will  subscribe back 🐰plz 🐰
kalyeserye
This was an ok performance but not worth the 10s given. Picking a winner at week four is both biased and a little premature.
Check out my page 20 years in maximum security prison
Brilliant energy, but the slide between Gorkas legs wasn't as smooth as it could have been and where were kicks and flicks ?  Also why no comment on pincy toes that seems a big deal with certain celebs?  Great dance but not a 10
shes a trained dancer though!!! it'd be like David Beckham playing in a celebrity football match¬!!!\n\nthe fake tears every week dont help either!
Oh dear oh dear, choreographed by Craig Revile Horwood in Sister Act and you say she's not a professional?? Shame that the comments have been removed from here regarding this.
I'm an Arsenal fan with a new channel so if any of you have time to check out my vids I'd appreciate it so much 🙏🏽 (Remember to sub if you enjoy! 💪🏽)
When Welbeck misses he's bambi on ice, when Ozil misses it's not his fault because he didn't deliberately miss.
let robbie talk for Christ sake
He seems to have a speech afliction.
I love DT! Mate, if you ever make it to Houston Texas(I don't know why) I'll buy you a few pints. You are my favorite Gunner along with Robbie!
What a mincer DT is. Better chance of him bumming you than fighting you.
He's from Luton looooool
2:20 and 4 minutes later says 6:17. You know, because he's such a rationale man
ozil is demanding big money, to compensate for the lack of ambition of the club.
I'm not a arsenal fan but dt makes this channel very interesting
Everytime Arsenal loses a match, this guy get richer.
If the one with the ridiculous hat had a brain he would be dangerous...What crap. He should blow it out of his arse\ninstead of on this nonsense site.....
Arsenal have most stupid fans. They get spit into face almost every week and they keep saying its just raining...
Im a united fan but i watch more arsenal fan tv just for the laughs
watching totenham's against real madrid made me realise how extremely below par Arsenal is, Arsenal is slowly becoming a Mid Table team right before our  very own eyes!!!!
After every arsenal game here's my next stop happy to see at least we're the best in something
I'd like u to see run a football club we will see arsenal in the championship
Arsenal are a joke
Be a million views soon
It's called gettn owned. Ohhhhhhhh
Chill out..lol..its only football..well not in Arsenals world.😎
Tell me how this guy actaully had some pretty good points and then he brought up Arse Wenger
Hit the nail on the head. Major underlying problems. You can't polish a turd
Ozil must go,he is a complete shit
Arsenal should be added to 1000 ways to die.
DT was stupid. ....no player misses deliberately. ...get a grip and stop defending ozil
Thats too strong, thats too strong Robbie SHFU DT!! Ozil is overrated and let the fans down. He does not care! I agree Wenger, Kroenke, Gazidis and so on are the main problem. Instead of buying Ozil, they should have pushed for Higuain. But, Arsene is indecisive and as soon as another club competes for a player, he buckles! We gave in to Napoli for a measley 2 mil. pounds. Then he should have used the buy back clause to get Cesc back the following season. Cesc is way better than Ozil in my opinion, and I have been saying this for years! I was saying during the Watford game, please do not let Ozil enter the pitch, bring on Wilshere who is hungry! I also felt he should have sold Sanchez as he does want to be at the club, but Wenger is clueless and undecisive. This goes much deeper than the issues I have portrayed and we have to put up with at least 2 more seasons with Wenger :(
Man City is slapping things up cause they make it rain cash on that cash club, what ya expect?
arsenal fantv is more entertaining than their games
Robbie if you ask a question then have the decency to let the other person answer, stop cutting them short
Subscriber to me if you want arsene Wenger to be sacked
Fat Robbie he always put the blame Ozil for arsenal lost thanks DT for defending Ozil
DT just imagine how good it is to be a tim winning every single week fucken amazing also up the ra🇮🇪🇮🇪
It's not just Wenger, It's Ozil, and every other player on that team. All garbage, Sanchez playing like garbage on purpose because he's stuck in a trash can of a club. complete overhaul needed.
The thing about Arsenal is there to flat, they need to use there big name players to attract more talent. That’s why Arsenal need to spend yeah Lacazette decent but is he really going to attract world class players? Cause the CL looks miles away now
To be fair its not just Watford fans who are laughing at you hahahaha Muppets.
#4 on trending. Robbie is laughing his head off haha
How can someone be so evil... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo22Al8H7GU
Amir kahn in the background
So what is an arsenal fan. I don't think I have ever seen a real arsenal fan. They diss there own club
what is this role reversal at the start\n\ndt defending players robbie going hard\n\nwat
Not sure why this is such a surprise!, said last season, pre-season and the start of this season Arsenal will be a mid-table club by the end of the season, possibly lower than 10th!...nothing has changed or will change!..which is good as I can't stand Arsenal, but I am been impartial in this, as a football fan of 41 years its easy to spot those clubs and the teams they have who is serious about winning leagues and European trophies and Arsenal are nowhere near that level and have slipped down the pecking order for the years now.\nSanchez and Ozil will be off on a free, possibly more will follow, Arsenal will not get European football next season and this will not attract big players but Sanchez and Ozil, they will l leave and suddenly they will be the world class players they are meant to be at another club, because Arsenal is an easy club to play for, the players are wrapped in cotton wool, they can under perform without the fear of being dropped from the team, paid a decent wage for doing nothing to earn the money as the fans keep paying more and more for season tickets because they won't say enough is enough...
2:05 \n\nWhat a roast. Take a bow son. Take a bow.
#2 on trending? Arsenal Fan TV is amazing, i've been watching robbie for like 4 years
I love this guy
you horns
DT is the only one who is level headed enough not to blame Ozil for missing his chance.
Not only Watford laughing at the Arse.Ffs...just fukin accept you ain't all that and believe me you won't get soooo carried away with your shite performances and lack of bollocks in your team.\nThis is not a dig at your club, just a statement of fact.\nI'm west ham...I know we're shite so I'm never suprised when we put in shite performances on the pitch.\nIt's like England FC,Does anybody seriously believe we'll win the WC next year?\nNo?Why?Cos we know we ain't good enough.Iceland ffs.\nSo don't get suprised when a good Watford team who never say die roll you over.\nRing Ring....reality calling.
Surely I'm not the only one that has watched this for over 3 times
His from Luton and support arsenal lol wt mug
Emre Can in the background
Canadian mass sensitive opinion demonstrate wisdom report historically necessity.
Why does he think Ozil is really good at the moment he's doing shit
This guy needs to learn how to direct his aggression!
this shameless creature called robbie my name is desperate larry no no bob smith
Blah, blah, blah, arsenal will win the f.a cup, and europa this season, and you will still be bitchin, what more you lot want,
Watford played well, they got lucky. They added new players and they only recently become a decent side. I give em respect
A major problem is this strange accent that seems to be prevalent across the UK. What happened to regional dialects?
Ozil missed is not that dramatic. Players like messi , ronaldo missed easier situation like those very often.  Agree with DT , letting fans down is a word too harsh to use.
It's more offside than your belly!
Love the way DT shut that mug up lol.
‘We’re a top 6 team’ shut up😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I was as tough as DT he's so dangerous
I feel bad for Sanchez and Özil, they deserve to play in a better team. They are world class players
ha ha ha ha ha he comes from luton  why ent he sayin fam and blood anymore non stop i thought he was from jamaica the other week
This guy is such a mug
BMT HE DOES NEED TO STOP TAKING LACAZETTE OFF AFTER 65 MINUTES, ITS SO JARRING, LET HIM FINISH THE GAME
Arsenal is doing shit tbh but so is Chelsea :(
I'm glad the fa banned the Watfords player for diving. A nice 3 game ban
Lmao after so much shit talking ozil's miss I went to see it. It's a common damn miss. World class players miss chances like that very often. Arsenal's problem is that they have very few chances like that, so whenever someone misses, it's a freaking tragedy.
I hate arsenal and one day I will take over the world and make all of you work In a death camp
Now afctv have views
Deeney wasn't offside ozil should have scored . DT is just noise
Whine whine whine. Try being a Bolton supporter
How is Watford>Arsenal
YOUUUUUUUUU HORNSSSSSSS
Girls love me
gobshite
THIS FAT TRAMP THINKS HES HARD LOL
He speaks alot of sense tbf

I enjoy seeing Arsenal rot
The 834 dislikes are probably all Watford fans
Taehyung warmed my heart at the end, he knew exactly what he wanted and was really excited about it. I admire his ambition. He's so cute 💗
Thats why i love tae, he is so unique & clever in a way that differrent from others, preach to say he is out of the box mind thinker & ppl that dont understand him call him weird like hell no. He’s into art, most of creative person have different style of thinking & express themself in their own artistic way
1:28.. look at hobi struggling to keep the mask on because it's slipping off his ears xD I love it when he wears hats and his ears get squished downwards like that, it's so cute !
i love them and their drawings :(
OK SO THIS IS ALSO TRENDING 😏😏\n**POWER OF BANGTAN**\n🔥🔥🔥
jin so friendly with the designer...
Wait Suga's a cookie... I guess when we call him a snack, they thought we weren't joking
Jungkook: Horse? Look at the mirror and draw yourself.\nJ-Hope: There's cameras here so don't make me swear. \n....\n....\nMe: Wait... J-HOPE SWEARS? WOAHHHH. :0
Kookie is my bias and I know it's all just for fun...but I still feel bad when they poke fun at Hoseok about the horse stuff. I'm pretty sure it isn't his favorite joke. Idk he's a good sport <3 but still
All of these characters ate adorable but I love Mang the most
This reminds me of an American reality TV show😂😂
Jhope really drive me crazy lol but i still love him so much
i know this was way before they appeared on Knowing Brother (based on their hair colour lol) but i really want my fellow Armys to stop calling hoba : horse etc , because when they were on knowing brother he said he wants to get a new nickname since he hated being called horse !!!
‘horse... j-hope look in the mirror’\n\nJUNGKOOK YOU LIL SHIT
J-hope sketch.wasn't that bad. I mean drawing to me is just a stick figure person😂 I'd give  j-hope a A* for efforts. Bless him
V is a genius! He truly has unique ideas 😍
Tae is such a genius, seriously. I love how he thinks out of the box.
The faces they put on those people tho 😩💀
I love this!!! They're so cute ‹3
wait but wHere the hell is yoonmin? 😂
This is just so cute. I’m soft.
Did Suga just disappear when everyone else started to draw??
First of all, THE ENGLISH SUBS! Strong power thank you <3
THANK YOU FOR ADDING ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!
BLESS THEIR ART♡♡♡ AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUBS
I can’t believe I stan these line stickers
Love from New Zealand ❤️🇳🇿

Taehyung's character w/ the wormtail makes it look like.....sperm
I want to see jimins drawing
Mükemmelsiniz İ LOVE YOU  İ LOVE BTS ❤TURKEY ARMY ❤WELCOME TO TURKEY🇹🇷🇹🇷
I really want to buy hoseok's character plushie if there's so much because IT LOOKS CUTE
I loved it how Hoseok looked like he was going to start swinging when Jungkook called him a horse shgfhdgf and Tae was extra cute with his baby chick face mask under his chin in this vid. Also 4:47 sounded like 'mamamoo' which I'm all for if I didn't perhaps mishear it 👀👀👀
if you listen to each of the characters ouo it describes them ouo \n\nalpha is jin oppa\n\nhorse is jhope oppa\n\nheart is v\n\nkoaloa us rapmon and he was drawing other emojis
Lol, V's collection of heart face character though. It's actually a great idea even though it's quite unusual.
JIN IS SO EXTRA. I REALLY LOVE THS ALPACA
For someone that really likes drawing, that table is HEAVEN OMG I WISH I HAD THOSE
If I were a female designer, I'd probably sit next to taehyung as well
taehyung already has so many ideas and thought since the beginning, and he looked more and more artistic nowadays👏I can really see that he will open an art show in seoul someday in the future
OMG Jungkook and J-hope! They're still at it with the J-horse! 😂😂😂 I love them all so much
I wanna be that persistent in life as hobbies ears are, everytime he wears a hat. :D
When will episode 2 come out?!!?!
2:41 Jin picking on JHopie's drawing, 2:46 Rap Mon telling Jin to ease up... Daddy keeping mommy from nagging the kids! #namjin feels
These characters are gonna turn out so cute istg
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE! LOVE Y'ALL
the fact that j-hope's drawing is at a level i will seriously never each is kinda mind blowing. Also V is so cute with his heart faces !
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT HOW ARTISTIC THEY ARE BUT DID YOU KNOW JIMIN'S DRAWING WASN'T SHOWN
Should it be cute so people will buy it?!\n\nYOU SUCCEEDED!
THANK YOU FOR THE SUBS 😭
3:34\nDesigner: Oh? You have talent, it's good\nJungkook:* fucking sips his drink *
Não vejo a hora de quando sair a animação, estou muito ansiosa! ARMY BR

JUNGKOOK HAS NO RESPECT
Love the rust coat!
Would love for Guy to add his OOTN/OOTD's whenever he is in your vlogs, if that is okay with you two 🙂😘 He always dresses so sharp! 🙂💕
It’s nice 10 years later and you and Chuck Bass are still going strong 😂😘
Amelia your bangs look amazing! :)
“Petrol” is so much classier than “gas” 😅
Honestly Amelia, when I see how amazing your style has become in comparison to your counterparts, I truly wish your Instagram focused more on your outfits rather than your surroundings. It looks too much like a travel/explorer/globe trotter Instagram and not enough like a fashion forward one. You buy often and there is also a lot of stuff that we would buy just from your outfits, which is what sharing your passion is about, right? it just seems like a better sharing platform to make your Instagram more about you rather than the places or surroundings. Does it makes sense? Hope so! xx
The dress length looks good on you so I don't think it needs alteration.
Amelia  I'm a vet and really Duke shouldn't be in a cone just after having his anal glands done. That is not a huge problem and there is no wound unless he had a cyst.  The poor little love should be running around as usual.  Change your vet or at least question what is going on?  Maybe Google the symptoms so you are a little clued up?  Love you BTW xxx
i miss your instagram lives. you are my celeb crush. you have perfect skin , face , body , legs and feet. id like you to show more of your beautiful body
Can you please do an eye creme recommendation video? :)
isn't Guy Amelia's sister boyfriend?
Very stylish! 😍😍😍
Stunk Stained and Horrible? Sound like my under crackers!
All the things wrong with this world and this is one of them!  children starving,war tore country's and then you get this Munter going on aboot shitty fashion and her ratdog! get a fucking grip people!
OMG I think the fringe was literally made for you🙌🏼😻Looks sooo freaking amazing.
Love that headband on you!!
Amelia so funny you calling duke little wound licker lol x
I would love to see a tutorial on your fringe. I am thinking about getting some too!
The spa towel looks cute on you :D
Love shopping videos! I just uploaded a  shopping with me in milan video. Check it out if interested:)
Dress length beautiful :-)
L-O-V-E the new hair! And the lack of that really intense winged eyeliner makes you look so effortlessly chic! Both changes, although small, have made a massive difference in your entire look! I hope you love it as much as we do!
This is what some humans about ...nothing but about themselves...brain washing other to be like them ..selfish...
My female dog has hers squeezed every month but the first time was the worst xxx
i love your hair!
Seeing Duke scuttling down your hallway 😍 What a doll
More vital work on behalf of humanity.
It's so super cute.How is Duke. You really always look so cute.Good for you 🐶
When Amelia and guy finally go out being in love, I will say 'I TOLD YOU!'
Can you link your earrings?? I love your taste and I always try to look for them after watching your videos ❤️
Any new youtubers? 👋🏽 subscribe to my channel new content coming real soon!
Fringe suit so well xx
Why the hell is this trending with 70k views
Another pointless female video.
Real question: as a style blogger, how do you keep your closets cleaned out? How do you not run out of space?
Wow that black jump suit looks so great and sexy on you!! In love with that rusty red coat as well xx
Dunno what on earth you talked about.. but you are v. cute.
Does anyone know were the rug is from?😍
HEY GUYS IVE JUST STARTED VLOGGING ON YT, CHECK MY VIDEOS OUT ON MY CHANNEL!!!!!! XOXOX
not
omg duke!!
The fringe is gorgeous !
Love this 💕💕💕
Poor Duke!!!
I LOVEEEE your haircut Amelia!!
7:13 gives me Estee fashun vibes
Pretty but so young.
my friend has the malono in blue she said they were uncomfortable  any ideas to make her comfy
Why is this on trending
Your fringe has definitely bought your wardrobe game up. Everything looks so chic on you now.
Amelia, my boy has just had an op. He does not like the cone so the vet gave him a vest to wear that fastens with poppers underneath. It has been the best thing ever!
Actually I think the dress and the shoes you had go together really well, it's different, and it wouldn't be everybody's taste but I like it a lot!
I’m a university student and can barely afford granola bars so I am and will continue to live through you 😍
They make soft cones that are more comfortable ... we have one for our dog by Kong via Amazon
I absolutely love your style! The way you dress is so me. Can you please do a Look for Less video on some of your outfits? I love so many of your outfits but I can’t afford a $300+ outfit.
I get the pro collar for my dogs rather than that plastic cone. It looks like an inflatable neck pillow or life jacket.
I need the cape from J Crew in my life! Love your blogs too much!! \nHope Duke is feeling more like himself xxx
U look so on fleek :))
Amelia you need to get duke a ProCollar. I don’t know if you have them in the UK but basically it’s an inflatable donut type thing that goes around their neck. It keeps them from being able to lick their wounds but they are still able to eat/drink with it on. I think maybe my vet called it an inflatable e collar so try checking for that so duke won’t be so sad and sulk!!
Those Manolos ❣️❣️❣️ and you've got really good legs too, so the heels will go with just about anything in your gorgeous wardrobe. X
Welcome to the epitome of the modern female...
This is just another example of everything that is wrong with western society.
Why the actual fuck is this 6th on trending
53k views and it's trending with the 400k music videos. What even is trending on youtube?
The H&M skirt, chunky cardi, turtleneck combo is my fave, looks gorgeous on you! xxx
Clothes at 8.40
Love all the clothes you bought.. and the lipstick you wore, what is it? 😍
Does anyone know the link to the black dress she’s wearing beginning of video? X
Amelia dresses always looks stunning.. this mens no bad just keep it up! We get the style and it so suits you🙂 good way!  Love the new hair too! You look so cute..
I really love the night out outfit, and the new haircut, you look gorgeous ^^ - Love from France, Célia
Proportion wise, shorten it for not over 5 cm. Dress will be still long enough, and princesslike, maybe just altered better for your height. But it needs to be a little bit shortened
I keep pausing this vlog to leave comments lol: I actually do like the fringe/headband thing and also really like the skirt and cardi paired with the grey-ish jumper! It gives it a nice contrast whilst stlll being neutral. Pairing it with a cream color jumper might end up a bit matchy looking. I love love love all your autumnal purchases!
Just love your style and taste of clothing.
Dress length is absolutely fine. I've never done this before, but I went straight and ordered that bag as it looks so gorgeous! A good alternative doe the Gucci Marmont. Xx
Awwww Duke-y sorry about the cone. But your mummy loves you and wants you to be healthy.💖
I think get the dress a little shorter, it's an awkward length.  And the pink band is alright, not that cute. Your hair looks better without it  lots of love
Yesss to the soft head accessory 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 looks good on you!
Where’s David? It’s been so long since we saw him last!
I guess youtube is broken for this to be on trending
Love everything you’ve shown including the hair turban ❤️
Petrol is called Gas in USA
I'm so obsessed with your style! I love when hauls are a part of your vlogs! <3
J.crew in the states does alterations for their customers
I would shorten your dress to the same length as the Pleated Skirt you bought online 💜
I love the dress the length it is and your hair is beautiful with the fringe a/k/a bangs in the US 😉👌  Love this video and Cone...ohmygosh he's so adorable!❤🌸
Love the length of the dress and the headband is super cute on you!
Wow I am obsessed with that maroon jacket.
Those shoes are the ones Big proposes to Carrie with in the Sex & the City Movie!!! That’s literally all I can think of whenever I see you wearing them.
Can Guy please make his own Youtube channel???
I'd love a video of you showing how you upkeep your fringe between washes and how you style them after:D they look so nice! xxo
Hahaha, this is that point of the night where I want to be in my house with my dog, literally, story of my life when I go out sometimes
I love Guy, Duke and.....retail therapy of course !
Your enthusiasm makes me so happy and in a good mood, take care Amelia 😘
The SHOES though! Love them! They remind me of the Manolos Mr Big proposes to Carrie with :P
I love your hair! Everytime i see it i'm tempted to get bangs/fringe myself. The straight w/bangs look makes anything you style look more editorial high fashion. Petrol (UK) is Gasoline (Gas in US).
Worse than  QVC. Fuck off.
Your voice is so irritating
I got that jcrew skirt as well and I'm usually a 6 but wear a 2 in it! I told the sales lady that it was vanity sizing at its finest because I haven't worn a two since high school 😂
AMELIA!!! I remember you talking about be boob tape, not the normal tape the one that you can scoop and lift them up with 😂can you let me know where to get some??? Please! Haha! Random comment!xx
Why the fuck is this cancer trending.
why does this remind me of DT on Wegner
Every 1 COME TO THE MILLION MASK MARCH  November the 5th
He really stuck the landing on this one. Bravo.
Jonathan's on the trending page! Next stop 10 Downing Street.
Not Palletways again! They've been video/film bombing since the bloody 70's!
As a Muslim who has mostly voted labour my whole life and who voted Brexit, may couldnt organise a piss up in a brewery. If shes not going to deliver she needs to hand the reins over.
The message here is....fuck off.
Reminds me of Glen from The Thick of It
Stop beating around the bush, are you a Theresa May fan or not????
get off the street you bellend.
So much gloom and doom about. By cunts like him. Life has never been so good living in the UK at any time in the last 10000 years. We are leaving the EU and corbin will never see power.
Stop sitting on the fence and tell us what you really think Mr Pie
I wish people would leave the woman alone! Let her get on with the job and quit the speculation. Pathetic video.
That was some delivery. PM you watching....
But seriously Theresa, FUCK OFF!! 👏👏😂😂\nTime for change! Wenger out...
I love how the bagpipes ramped up along with the speech
i am worry that he might get heart attack ... 🙄 he get high blood pressure
This would be a news programme I could get behind.
Thinks he a newsman he’s just a stupid cunt
Brexit in a nutshell... Well said
Good show.   The woman is incapable of doing anything but swallowing whatever is poured into her poisoned chalice.
The Arsenal fan TV of politics
Fucking hell that was outstanding
This guy should be the prime minister.
John Pie for Prime Minister!!!!!
*JONATHAN PIE FOR PRIME MINISTER*
Is this reporter fake because the amount of times I've seen him like this a it's hilarious!!!
Dithering moose????? I love british people.
Time to f*ck off toury party
You need a platform on LBC! James O'Brian.... eat your heart out!
this video made me want to sit under my chair
GO FOR THERESA MAY!!
i wish you would just go you parasitical hack with you same ass fake shit
1:33 She's improvising Brexit, like a never-ending Jazz solo.
First time i came across this video and i already love him already!   lol
this is better than the actual news
Let Boris show you how it's done... But seriously Theresa fuck off!\n\nThis killed me😂💀
Swearing in front of children. Nice one
When you understand that politics is based on money and power and the dividing of people.\nYou totally understand why it gets people worked up like this douche.\nBrexit the whole f in thing. \nAnd can someone please look in to Tony Blair a bit more? I remember him bringing a ps4 back from the US, was a gift before it was out. and he got away with it cos he was PM, well let's bring it all back up. Toss these a holes in to the pits!\nPlease, thanks!
Unlike Teresa May.. Palletways deliver!  I think the driver IS a straight white male.
A remoaner if I ever saw one.\n\nYou can just tell he's the type of doode who catches you fucking his wife and wants to take a walk in Hyde park with you to talk it out, little cuck.
This woman told the whole world during the election campaign that she is a difficult woman she warned the British public why complain now anyone who vote for her deserve what they get she didn't force anyone to vote tory everyone has the free will to choose to vote labour Conservative or any party but lies promises brainwashing and you all taught immigrants were a threat to your own selfish interest got this country to where it is don't blame the government blame yourselves if the people are good the leaders will be good if the people are bad then the leaders will be bad it's the public who elect the leaders the leaders don't elect themselves
1:00 we deliver thats the most straight forward slogan ever.
I agree entirely with his summary of May, but very, very misleading and sensationalising the case about EU nationals.  Nobody at all is saying foreign nationals will be ejected from the UK if there's no deal, the issue is what rights the people here and UK nationals in the EU will have, and which court will hold jurisdiction in both cases.  Those aren't small matters that can be rushed into or done blindly.  Labour said they'd grant EU nationals here residency rights, but said so without having any clue what that would actually mean in practice - that's just a ridiculous, negligent, and irresponsible stance to take because it would give the EU complete control over deciding the outcome, and the UK with no cards to look after our own citizens living in the EU.  Oh, we'd just trust the EU to do the right thing by the UK?  Ha!  In the words of Pie  fuck off!!!
I do not recall the last time that in such a short space of time have I heard such a vulgar, disgusting barrage of swear word's, was it at lunch today? Or breakfast this morning? Hmm, I just dont recall, I love it.
Totally brilliant as ever Mr Pie!\n\nThe weird thing is that nearly 5% disagree with you.  What planet are they on?
Great stuff!!  Once again Pie tells it how it is.  Take his advice Theresa. - please take his advice.
No one voted for this well not actually right is it?
Someone actually worthy of being on the trending tab.
Come on Jonathan where's your diatribe against the vicious cruelty of Universal Credits? If you can't stick it to the slime balls on this you have lost it.
Jeremy Paxman asked her if she believed in Brexit during the campaign and she declined.
If you U turn twice, you're back where you started 😂 true!
This is a long ad for Palletways.
2:11\n13\n(6_+)\nPay the Bill or the kid gets it!\n(-_-)\nBetter do as he says 33!\n(9_+)\nNo!\n(-_-)\nMe either!   I'd rather die!
he said no one voted for eu nationals to be bargaining chips I personally voted for brexit coz I'm sick of all the eu nationals I really don't care about tariffs etc, I'm sick of the fucking bozos!!!
Put this guy in Parliment.
So is it time to Fuck off Theresa or time to fuck off, Theresa? I can’t do anything until I know if it’s addressed to her or a call to arms for the rest of us..
Somone get this man a raise
This is f*cking brilliant 😂

SUB-FARAGE!!!!!!
Well ..... I wanna thank God making me exist to be able to watch a legend called Taemin
Taemin has such a unique voice and style <3 so happy to see him thriving
80s vibes and I'm loving it! Grown and sexy comes so easily.
I can't  stop to watch mv! this is art! OMG!
Matrix vibes? Is this MV based off the Matrix? If it is, this is brilliant. I love it.
Best mv from SM
오지고 지렸내요..
Fuck it \nImma watch it again
move really grew on me so muchhh, and watching the choreography makes it so much better
I find Taemin too underrated. His music is not my style, but I have followed his career ever since he was a lil coconut boy. He was even very talented back then and really, till this day grew so much in his talents and still does not get enough recognition. Besides all of this, is this not one of the more unique idols in Kpop? Dont disagree with me ;-)
I need him to keep that hairstyle/haircut forever! 😍
TAEMIN IS NOT MASCULINE NOR FEMININE; GENDER DOESN'T MATTER HE'S OUT!
I love all about him when he is on stage (he naturally transforms himself to a man, a great entertainer) and off stage (still a baby taemin) :)
Hmm.. idk I don’t like it. \nI love Taemin but come on.. this felt weird. His dancing was feminine and it didn’t suited him... he looked Gay. \nI’m not against the idea of ‘gays’ whatever but it just wasn’t for him...
he is amazing !!! ilove that hip move
He's a living legend y'all
I couldn't recognize him!
At first I was confused but now I'm like wow this is so dope. so cool, so fresh!
Am I the only one who thinks @ 1:31-1:34 he looks like kai
Also I want see Shinee members react to this video! IT MUST HAPPEN
THAT'S MY KING
tbh for me, he’s kind of like new jyp, but of course there’s a big difference. This is gold. Like, you dont see this very often in kpop. Good luck tae! you killin it!
I can see Jimin learning this too!!! Love it
10 years have been added to my life
CAME HERE FOR KOHARU AND OMG THE CHOREO WITH HER FEELS <3
0:56 So sassy and yet so manly at the same time im....STAR STRUCKED😍😍😍

2:35 when you want to be sexy but gotta stay PG
Jaw dropped literally
Love love is all
Love it

Everything is amazing.   The song, the performance and the MV and Taemin of course !!!!
3:04 I choked on the bottom I was eating
I have lost the amount times I have listened to this 😂😂 \n\nI LOVE IT!! ❤❤❤
Great, now I have yet another k pop group to learn everything about, c'mon let me finish seventeen first (13 is a ridiculous number of members).
It hit me so hard, man...\nTaemin has his own genre now, it's Taemin pop. I'm so proud of him...he's improving more and more everytime...this is so classy but dirty and beautiful and ruuuude. Bravo, Artist Lee Taemin. Shawol loves you ♥ I'll be waiting for our 5HINee too ♥
Oops I'm here again for the nth time
this is so fresh and i think maybe even legendary. i'm so impressed!
Baby this is Gold 😍🔥
I'm officially dead. KING \nPS: bless those see through shirts, that big ass cleavage and Taemin's body.

Damn that bass line is golden.

OMG I love it I love it I love it ❤❤😍
an androgynous king
Taemin,tao seduzente!.
게이같네
판에서 무브병짤보고 왔는데.. 보자마자 나도 전염된듯
is that KOHARU SUGAWARAAAAAAA!!!???? 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Im pretty sure that he's gay or at the very least bi but unfortunately in a country like Korea he must be hetero
I love Taemin but the fans are kinda annoying sometimes tbh. Could you please stop comment that he is the first one who has a androgynous concept in kpop or that no one can ever reach him. This is stupid af. He and other 1st generation Kpop groups also copied a lot from the western world. It's almost impossible nowadays to do something that hasn't been done before. I think there are many new groups with potential to create something as beautiful as this.
I don't know why this is trending, but I like it.
Don’t get me wrong, great clip, but why is it trending with just 30k views.
That monkey was infected, you had to put it down.
for a moment he sounds like a monkey lul
I like the screaming, all unarmed players should do this when being shot

Poor monkey. \nThx Kotaku. Best clip in that episode.

Why is this #17 trending 😂
How is this even possible? Did you rig googles search engine
+PLAYERUNKNOWN your game has made it to trending\nCongrats
In the original Japanese, Michelle was actually talking about Adam and Eve, and how they would have shared the first kiss.\n\nIf you look closely, the couple kissing in the shadows are actually Serena and Darien, since you can see you-know-who's iconic odango's. Presumably, Serena is imagining herself and her prince to be the iconic couple.
Why is this trending I thought this was going to be a meme or something
Why dis trending. I mean i love sailor moon but still...
why is this on trending ?
Wtf
Shit
Brad....sounds like a fuck boi name
Why this trending
This was 3 years ago wtf whys it trending smh
This is trending? what!?
That's funny, I've never heard of a Brad that goes to our skeül
Yeah...........Brad............riiiiiiight lol
0:18 That looks like Serena and Darian then Brad lol
Damn how many cousins does she have?
Michelle:I wonder where he is today... *Looks to Amara*
The dub tried to make Michiru and Haruka's relationship as straight and non-homo as possible but I think they somehow ended up making it even gayer lmao
Wow, the dub was really brad.
This Brad boy does have a nice set of knockers tho
Haruka and Michiru tried so hard to hide their relationship in both languages for this season but the dub made it even less convincing. XD
Oh man, this translation is so stupid... Michiru was actually talking about Adam and Eve! I can't understand why they changed it...
Is brad also their cousin?
Michiru actually kisses someone. I've never seen Haruka or Michiru kiss before
Funny how Michelle looks a lot like Serena in that flashback, and Brad a lot like Darien
My sweet Har-Bread! Oops did I say bread? I meant brad...Sh-He's not my cousin because that's silly!\nThis is how I see this dub
Amara: /checks watch/ Well, would you look at the time... Its time for some good ol' Frick Fracking
I'm sure brad is closer than you think. XP 
They talk about this guy like he's dead. Maybe Amara secretly killed him so that he wouldn't be Michelle's cousin
Sounds like Michelle just ate a sandwich with a thick layer of sticky peanut butter on top.
'My sweet brad shouldn't that be My sweet cousin
IM HETEROSEXUAL I SWEAR
hahaha they're not even trying
I love Amara's laugh at the end xD it's like she's saying yeah..Brad's real... XD
Yeah, I wonder where Brad is now ;)
Brad must be her cousin, too.
Amara is laughing like: oh is that what you're calling me now?
More hunkier than Mike XD
Can anyone please tell me which episode this is please? I'm discussing the erasure of queer representation in the Cloverway dub of Sailor Moon for a project.
Neptune: My sweet Brad, I wonder where he is today…\nUranus: *scoffs\n\nYeah, Uranus knew she was bullshiting!
he's cheating on you with jessicaaa!
OH BRAD~
I guess Brad had a sex change
Brad? That's not how you spell Haruka!
It sounds like she's saying my sweet bread.
COUSINS INTENSIFY\n(yesssss my favorite clip, im so happy you uploaded it!!!)
You ever wonder where Brad went, Brad?
All know that was amara lol!
UH, why is Brad kissing Serena?
That moment when you come back to this video, and see 69 likes Kappa
I swear they are purposely making fun of their relationship ... In the dub 
Last I heard, Brad was dating Twilight Sparkle and got eaten by the Reapers or something
so in the past Michelle was wearing odangos too? and why does Brad looks like Mamoru?
We all knew where they went after this...
Who the fuck is Brad?  Is he another cousin of Amara's?  Just how many cousins does she have!?
(COUSIN MENTIONING INTENSIFIES)
Cute❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😹🌙🌙❤️❤️❤️🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
I know who Brad really is...
I thought in the original Japanese version instead of Micheal saying Brad I thought she was saying it was Amara.😂 Can't blame me, right?
Are you sure it was just a first kiss? More like first time in bed together since nobody has their first kiss naked...
see ya
Wonder where he is? While 'he' is smirking like crazy
Lol at that shadow actually being haruka/amara thank goodness were getting viz to be honest with it all
Brad looks like Mamoru, come to think of it brad it Mamoru !
No commit on this... u wouldn't like it
GAAAAYYY
I love the background misic. Giggity.
Haruka Tenou doesn't say 'see ya'.
Oh my sweet bread
I wonder where he is today? LOL Try two feet across from you, Michelle!
Luis Suarez scores late for a point! Griezmann to Barca in the summer for 100m € release clause? 🔥🔥
help me with a sub guys...
Suarez is the hero yet again. He always shows up in big games
athletico just gain a fan here.
We need dembele back need to sign a couple of defenders we have plenty of midfielders Roberto a put coming Legend not complain but really enjoy this game but hope we learn from it
Pls help this message  reach Barcelona coach that anytime Andre Comes start a game  mostly barca struggles .

Ronaldo is king of football!
wtf why Gomez to starte the game because of Gomez we can't win the game we have better player dannis, deloufae n Roberto to starte the game instaed of Gomez this is first time varvelde make mistake in the squad to lose the point I hope he won't make a mistake again in the next  many game to play otherwise barca derserve to win this match
I feel the commentators were trying way too hard to pronounce the player's names in a Spanish way.
its the death of football the ball is so light and fast the keeper cant see it you rarely see anything spectacular from keepers because the ball is so fast they only can block it by instinct \n90s produced amazing players in all positions now they try to benefit attackers and dribblers as much as possible but the real highlights belong in all parts of the game\n90s and early 2000 teams used to be a lot more complete but now football is dead because all they care about is goals
4.12 was that pronounced correctly? Xd
That last pass by Andre Gomes was really skillful. I wonder if he meant to bounce it on the ground
gotta say i love the commentators in this match!!

Awxm
Deulofeu should be starting almost all matches right now along with Denis and Roberto. Rakitic should be benched imo and give Iniesta a rest often times. Andre Gomes should also play more against weaker teams to get more confidence and keep him going. He can improve.
Why cant this commentator pronounce their names correctly😂
These commentators are so shit.
Great game from both teams
Commentators are trying way too hard to pronounce the players names correctly.
msi king of the king
The stadium is beautiful.
Atletico Madrid's new stadium is almost look alike Wembley Stadium lol

Messi played good
Barca is different from Argentina. Messi isn't always good and nice to score and be a Messiah to carry his team from disappointment. It's just a simple thing, because Messi is human. He needs to be relaxed to have the best manner. At Barca, the players around can score without Messi, but Argentina can't. This makes me so sad and unhappy.\nHope Messi will always have the best emotional before every match! <3
FO.. BARCA...SUAREZ A BITING DOG AND MESSI A MESSED UP MAN.... U CAN SCORE ONLY ONE TO ONE... AND IN 100 GOALS IF AND IF SCORED FROM LONG DISTANCE COMMENTETORS AND PEOPLE SHOUT LIKE CRAZY.. IDIOTS..WHO HAD WORD.... I WANT TO BE IN TEAM WHERE RONALDO IS THAT FINISHESSS ALLLLLLL...... HAHAHAHAAAHAHAAA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnVcCtC_1iY \namazing free style
The way this bloke says Suarez is so fucking. Annoying
Juan Oblak is class!!
What an amazing game, is lovely to see another good team in the league, atlético has done his job pretty well lately
Luis Suarez scores late for a point! Griezmann to Barca in the summer for 100m € release clause? 🔥🔥\nthe best atack but + martial = the best potential
That was a great game, I'm not even a Barca fan

At 4:13, she says the most personal song on her album is Ready For Ya, but that’s not a song on the album. I’m so confused lol

Her laugh gives me life!
Puppies are so distracting wth 😭❤ I only got half of what she said

Available now?  My copy won't be here until tomorrow :-(
You know considering the smallest things offend people nowadays I'm surprised Ubisoft (or any studio for that matter) is allowed to make these games or tv shows but boy I'm glad they do
Unlock the game. For god's sake unlock the game
SO GLAD there are no LOOT BOXES in this game.
well great my order hasnt come yet
I'm going to be f***in broke as hell
This game is somehow more crazier than the stick of truth
If no one else will say it I will\n\nThis game is severely over priced
are they allowed to swear in traliers
confirmed, you can play as a female character in the game BUT everyone will still call you a HE for some reason
but kenny hasnt changed a bit...
This looks fire
WTF is southpark doing making another fucking amazing game, like come on give other games a chance  you cant make something this perfect
Ubicrap u r game has been cracked.u use denuvo.we r not buying this game.bethesda is not use denuvo in evil within 2.we already bought that.
Here's another idea when you say you have customer support actually supports your damn customers
Need to buy this game.
I like how it says out now and the game isn't even out yet. Biggest fail ever.
Please make us a switch version
Downloading right now! The Stick of Truth was hilarious. I don't doubt that this will be just as good
0:33 And theres more where that came from, fatass!!
this game is so hillarious, i got a lil blonde girl wearing a tiara and a wizard wand thingy
Can't wait to pick this up later! Love South Park humor!
Love the game even it isnt already launched. I'll make a video about the game :3
that shold Be a movie

Troy Deeney In Wenger Out
Only Iwobi and Welbeck seem ready to fight for Arsenal
Well said Troy Deeney. Thanks for calling it what it is. Hopefully it will change something in the Arsenal players mentality, unlikely though. They are happy earning easy wages, with no pressure from the manager or board. We don’t to need to win the title or anything because we are already a money making machine, ain’t that right Stan?
Troy is eyeballing the pundit job better watch out Savage...
Arsenal have no nuts? Looks like they need to sign a snickers in January.
watching totenham's against real madrid made me realise how extremely below par Arsenal is, Arsenal is slowly becoming a Mid Table team right before our eyes
he has got a mug that you would not get tired of smacking, dissing the mighty arsenal like he is a world beater what has he ever won in his career giving it large let in 6 at city
He said the truth.\nArsenal is fucking shit this season!
Hats off to Deeney. Exposing Arsenal for the mercinary shithouses they are. I feel for the Arsenal fans, they deserve better than this for the money they pay every season.
Nonsense. What has his bravery done for Watford? They'll never finish above Arsenal despite their nuts
No english team, even the national, have 1 cojon at least
Fook me that boy is ugly bless him, slagging off arsenal, just a run ov the mill prem player, never never never get in arsenals team
Arsenal Wenger listening the boss?
always a blue nose!
Troy Deeney speaks sense and is so honest about what he brings to the table, England need more players him
ya still a sack of shit deeney, I'd rather have titus bramble play in your position
I am an arsenal fan and I totally agree with Troy he is so right
When was the last time you finished in the top 4....or top 10?????
As an arsenal fan, this is sad to hear.
Overweight  Troy Deeney what a tube that's why he's still with a bucket team the cunt dived and cheated I blame the ref he should be punished it's time to punish refs for there stupid mistakes it's costing teams
Brilliant, someone should seriously look at Troy as a pundit whenever he chooses to retire.
Im an Arsenal fan and he's not wrong with anything he said about us.
who gives a fuck what a bloke called troy thinks...shit cunt
Can't even hate on Deeney. My blood is Arsenal but he nailed everything. Better attitude than everyone apart of our damn club.\n\nI feel he has some love for Arsenal knowing how his son supports us - it's sad to know the reality of how poor things have become for us.
This guy also kicked an already unconscious guy in the head on a night out.
Is the guy in the ponytail a real person ? That voice with that hair with those clothes is a peculiar combination
Man sounds like he has mucus in his throat😂😂
Omg get him on as a commentator!!! Never heard anything so real- us fans relate to guys like that- he needs to be on match of the with ian wright
Deeney says hes the man with no ego - come off it Mr self proclaimed hard man.. Also his ego has just told the arsenal defence how to play them in the return fixture...man before team
fucking humble bloke hes a perfect example for young footballers
Who is this guy?
Hi, i am a new fifa 18 youtube gamer, fifa 18 and i'm trying to grow my youtube channel SUBSCRIBE! MY BIRTHDAY CAN I GET SOME SUBS PLEASE
Lol troy deeney jus told them brum style!!! Their not on it!
Way to go Troy......he is great inspiration in so many ways :)
He invited his prison friends and scored an own goal Last season
Arsenal fan but Deeney told it true. Props to him
Damn, this nigga fucked Arsenal hard. Fucking Arsenal man makes me have a heart attack every weekend
Troy is a smart guy.
Derby will be remembered for his post match interview and never as a good footballer!🖕😊
Watford are doing a great job, everyone though they was going down. MARCO SILVA.#
state of savage's haircut
Respect to you Troy
Nice to see a footballer actually give a true opinion on something instead of a textbook answer. Refreshing to see!
Pillow bath European here defendant violence wave bitter down best so
How dare you Troy! Arsen just bought a packet of KPs.
If Troy Deeney can sit there and point out these flaws not long off the pitch, surely the Arsenal players themselves know that they've not got the grit or fight to ever win the league. I've never thought Wenger's failings were tactics, it's always been in his lack of mentality in leadership to incite a reaction out of his team.
is it jus me or is deeney speaking like an arsenal fan
i can just imagine Roy Keane in this arsenal team,he would be sent off every game for hitting his own team mates,this was a case of men against jelly babies
Arsenal is a failed state. They need aid and water and urgent  restructuring. But they are held captive by an evil dictator.  There's only one man who can save them.  Trump.
Big up to troy. Only if more footballers were like This!
Deeney just saying everything arsenal fans have known know for a while now
Can't even get mad it's true
I mean yeah they won but cmon acting like Watford beat arsenal all the time...1 win yet come end of season arsenal will be around the top Watford will be nowhere near it
Deeney a Watford player is finally the first player to say what all fans think about a modern day but mostly shitty arsenal back four
I want a mouthful of egg fart
90% of the likes on this video i guarantee are from Gunners
Since when do current players come on the show? This is great. Cojones
I swear Robbie Savage has been on the drink.
It’s true the players of that club care more about their hairstyles
This is humiliation for Arse'nal Training Centre. Nobody players are telling them how they bullied them during the game and how they will bully them in future games. The best run club in the world?
Arsenals problem isn't lacking physicality Barcelona dont have physicality arsenals problem is mental all of their players r mentally weak u look at barca similar types of players but mentally strong all r winners they even get dirty busquets for eg everyone talks about his passing understanding of the game nobody talks about his defensive skills or that hes got a nasty side as well he lets opposition players know whats what everytime u play him messi iniesta mindset of winners thats y they r so successful over such a long period
He is ranting coz he does not have the skills to play for big clubs,
Love the honesty of this session.
Bolasie scores the winner against Arsenal, then trolls arsenal on twitter by saying hes going to enjoy arsenal fan tv, Troy deeney scores against arsenal then goes on National TV and says Arsenal dont have nuts and he loves playing against them, Arsenal have been hammered by big teams so much times that now even smaller teams like watford and palace want a piece too
such a normal bloody person not some marketable twat. big up deeney
Deeney isn’t even being a prick because he’s such a lovely guy. He’s a great leader and that’s clear.
What a lad
Troy needs a cameo on AFTV!
Troydinhi
Like an empty Asylum!!
DEEEENEEEEY

Aii Deeney kept it real
Troy Deeney looking for Nuts 👀
Deeney needs to shut the Fuck up. His side got a gifted penalty and all of a sudden he's the guru of Arsenal futbol club.. this is a man who is starting on the bench for Watford, has never won shit and has never been good enough to play for a big club, let alone represent his country, now he's running his mouth about Arsenal and Ozil? Shut up mate.. !
Seriously though Troy Deeny plays for watford how can he be criticising arsenal like arsenal are bottom of the league? Jesus... talk about getting gassed..
loool man scores a goal afta 14 matches and thinks his the best in da leahue fukin watford bencher
It starts from the top they all lack nuts
Troy deeny is overweight for a footballer
Lights no need to be stressed about charts, views or anything. Just enjoy their music. They're still doing very good for a boygroup in their 8th year. They even have their own company, so they can release whatever they want haha. Its not that we're not streaming on youtube or the other music charts but the competition is tough. Btob, nueast, bts and exo are on the charts too. I'm happy because highlight comeback with this cheerful and positive vibes. I hope they promote celebrate because the song is gold 👍

When i saw the thumbnail i clicked on it immediately because i had to know what was on your face. You look so breath taking. Also i think you look so glowy and it made me laugh that you said you werent used to being so matte. Lol but anyways you look amazing.

I love my oils, my natural/satin/dewy finishes and i have been loving Cover Fx illuminating setting mist😍 you should try it. Love the highlighter, i bought trophy wife today. Gonna use it as eyeshadow. Thanks for this review!

254,"New subscriber - love how this looks on your skin.  It looks dewy and flawless even though it sounds like it feels otherwise.  I've watched a couple of other reviews of the products and that's how I found you.  That seems to be a commonality.  What it feels like vs what it looks like are two different things though the matte feeling wasn't described as bad.  It sounds great for oily or combo skin but mine is super dry so I'm thinking there is no way it will work on me.

They are coming today and I am super exfit3d to try them!!💖💖. Brianna is my woman crush so it's a bonus that I get to support $$ her and also support my own love of makeup at the same time!! Lol
",1
263,"I bought my shade online and it's about 70 shades too light. Lesson learnt: listen to Jamie and don't buy online 😂
",1
264,"See with the contour sticks do they have warmer ones? I use the smashbox ones still (throwback!) and I use a more cool toned one to contour, then I highlight (then I would cream blush if I used it), but then I blend my warmer shade where I would normally bronze and blend it a little further down or upward on my cheekbones and it acts as a bronzer rather than a contour stick. Don't know if you'll even see this but just thought it would help if you did want to utilise one as a cream bronzer.

266,"I'm a huge fan of your make-up looks, but this one is the best I've ever seen on you. Your skin is flawless and the lipgloss looks stunning on you and suits you a million times more than anything I've ever seen you wear on your lips. You should def' wear the foundation n highlighters again and the lipgloss is the biggest keeper xoxo

613,"Actually believe it or not Nunes won the fight, the punchings exchanges were positive for her the 2 first rounds. Valentina got more overall. Nunes' plan was to weaken that right leg from Valentina for the 4 rounds and then secure the win with a takedown in the last one. The standing fight was really close tho, valentina shown more combinations and techniques but most of them were not significatnt/strong ones. If Nunes didnt performed the takedown on the last round she would have lost. The last round was very positive in the standing game for Shevchenko.\n\nNunes clearly managed the octagon and distance for the entire fight, and thats a fact. Valentina knew Nunes was abusing her leg with low kicks and did practically nothing about it.
",-1
614,"shut up nunes you lost
",-1
615,"I think a reasonable person could see how either fighter could have been given the decision.   Valentina herself only thinks she won 3 rounds, so if the judges disagreed with her on only one round then she lost.  My assessment is that Amanda clearly won rounds 1 and 5, while Valentina won round 4, so the debate is who won rounds 2 and 3.  Valentina, I thought was too defensive and although she has quicker hands, she was only waiting to counter, problem is Amanda knew it, so Amanda was the aggressor but she was using low kicks and kicks to the abdomen, making it difficult for Valentina to counter and limited her scoring opportunities.  Because Amanda was the aggressor and the judges are suppose to award the aggressor, since they are bringing the fight, that's was the key reason Amanda won.  You can play it safe like Valentina, be defensive and only plan to score by countering the whole night, but don't be surprise when you lose, since the only fighter I've seen to have success with that strategy in title fights is Mayweather, but unfortunately Valentina is not Mayweather.  Lastly, I suspect Valentina was gun shy after feeling Amanda power in the first fight, since that's the only reason I can think of that would cause her not to let her hands go, when her hands are clearly quicker that Amanda's.
",1
616,"Valentina beat herself with a stupid fight plan.  She used the same passive fight plan she used on holly but this just in, Amanda saw that fight.  Valentina didn't want to take risk so all Amanda had to do was be the aggressor in each round knowing since close rounds go to the aggressor.  Amanda plan was to simply out point valentina unlike her other fights were she goes for the ko, thats why she was smiling in between rounds because she knew she was winning.  She won the fights with those leg kicks, kicks to the abdomen and those take downs in round 5, while valentina was sitting there waiting to counter, something she didn't get to do much

630,"That was some bullshit for real that the crooked judges gave Amanda Nunes the win over Valentina Shevchenko! They did her dirty right there. I finished watching the fight just now. Valentina clearly won that fight and should be the next champion. Valentina gave the most connected striking in each round than Amanda did towards Valentina. Valentina stopped one of Amanda's takedowns, successfully gotten out of one of her traps on the ground in the last round, with exception for the last takedown which Amanda didn't hardly do anything when she was on top of her. No submission or ground pounding from Amanda...while Valentina on her back was striking her really well. I don't blame her for being angry about the decision and filing a appeal for a third fight. For over a year now, these judges would make decisions over fights screwing these fighters of their win when it was obvious they scored the fight in each round incorrectly and unfairly. I don't what drugs these judges were on or what they got against Valentina, but they are wrong for making that decision. Sorry. They need to hire new judges who are experienced in judging these fights. That's just how I feel. 😠 It's time for a *Trilogy* ☺

That doesn´t mean Bono can´t reach high notes, this is meaning that for the first time and since they are touring is better to preserve his voice. On the other hand Bono has a little craspy voice here, since he is suffering a lot with air conditioning so anytime he flyes has the same little problem... he also has some allergy in dry cities or cities near the dessert (like California). Again that doesn´t mean he´s not able to sing because being older, but because is human.

929,"This is a great theory and I definitely hope we will get to see the duel in the movies, hopefully in the last one, but you have made one mistake, or rather not explained an apearent mistake by the books. If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!

930,"You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔
",1
931,"Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it.

946,"You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella.

I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something.

962,"If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\n\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\n\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\n\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^
",-1
963,"It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.

But Bojack's grandfather.. is byfar the worst character on the show. I understand that there's no excuse for Bojack or Henrietta's actions throughout the show, but the grandfather doesn't have that luxury to fall back on. Since he's been introduced, he's been dismissive and absent when it comes to dealing with any hardships that weren't his own. Instead of supplying comfort for his wife when she was in need he abandoned her and later had her lobotomized when her life was spiraling out of control. I can make a list of issues this dude has but.. it's just too depressing to go on.. to his that all this hate and hurt originated from one man who was just.. sickening

It was never him being a bad child. It was about her taking out her frustrations and anxiety on others. It was about her making sure that everyone was just as miserable as her. And lo and behold BoJack took out those frustrations on people he cared about. Not because he thought any of it was right, but because it was normal to him to be this way.\n\nBecause remember: abuse doesn't have to be physical at all. Emotional abuse can be terrifying and ugly and nobody would even know it was until it was too late.\n\nAnd the both of them just couldn't admit it because why would they? You can't do a whole hell of a lot as a child against your parents.\n\nDoes this justify their actions? No, of course not. But it does paint a clearer picture as to why they are this way.

I'm so glad to see you getting better all the time and figuring things out with a great attitude. ;)\nThe only time I ever felt like I was going slow was when I had a high fever as a child and I was delirious too.

I was on anxiety meds throughout chemo and found them helpful, but I guess I was lucky that the particular med I took didn't interact with the particular kind of chemo I received.\n\nI can't believe the jerks saying not to take chemo, or that whatever snake oil they read about on Facebook would cure cancer.  Nobody without an MD has any business telling someone how to treat their cancer.

1899,"chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube.
",-1
1900,"I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden.

Ask people who used it since the original Note. People do a lot other stuff with it, not just to open apps.\nIf your finger is so small that you don't need an S-Pen.

2528,"Is this a newly discovered vocal found in the vaults of his past recordings, or is it a reworking of his vocal from the original track from the '90s?  If it's a reworking of the original, I'm not a fan of how, at different points, they messed with George's vocal on this compared to the original. His voice sounds less robust, and, when he hits the Fantasy high note his vocal sounds a bit more coarse and not as clear as compared to the 90s version of Fantasy, which, I must say, I like better.

The format for a start (Graham in an armchair with three celebs on a nice sofa) is completely different from the typical US talk show which always looks like an office: a large table with the host seated on an office chair looking like he's about to give a job interview!

2987,"The greatest American talk show of all-time was The Dick Cavett Show. Guests drank, they smoked, and they talked about literally whatever they want. Sometimes, guests had nothing to plug and went on just because they felt like it. Even though his show is more celebrity-oriented, Graham Norton's show is the closest thing to what Cavett was doing. Once they get the plugging out of the way, that's when Norton starts having fun with guests (of which there's a real variety of talent), and they love him for it. Colbert is fine -- unlike Fallon, he can actually conduct something resembling a conversation -- but his format and his attitudes are much more conventional. Colbert presents himself as a good liberal but his corporate masters would never allow the sort of irreverence that Norton's show allows.
",1
2988,"One of the reasons why UK talk shows are so much better than American ones is that they have several guests on at a time, so that they can interact, which contributes far more to hilarity than just one guest and the host talking!

",1
2991,"The fact that Stephen asked Graham if he really offer his guests liquor proved that he has never watched the Graham Norton show nor did his homework as any interviewer would do. Asking about how to get guests to interact in a show is exactly why Stephen should be watching Graham's show. He can learn from Graham how fast and relevant and humorous his response is. Unlike Stephen who is always and only know to bitch about Trump on his show. Stephen comments and response are almost always boring and uncreative. Unlike Graham who doesn't need to make offensive and rude remark on anyone and yet is almost always super funny and insightful. I can continue to make the comparison but I shall stop here. Point is Stephen Colbert is boring
",-1

Everyone saying “don’t be dumb, evacuate.” It’s not that easy. There are only 2 main highways that go North through Florida, and if you’re trying to leave the state, good luck hopping off and refueling. Last thing you want to do is run out of fuel on the road when the storm is coming. This is the bad scenario with FL, when a storm affects both coasts. There’s nowhere to go but North.

Whenever I wear a fuller coverage foundation it never lasts on my skin, I find that I produce more oily even when it's a matte foundation. My skin is very dull but I try and take care of it the best I can. Shall I stay away from a higher coverage foundation? Is it why I'm getting more oily throughout the day? \nI would just like a long lasting foundation that doesn't make me skin look dull

My other cat had died a year earlier and I missed having a cat so much. My mom would drive us to the Humane Society every week to check for kittens. The third week they were there! A little older than I was expecting (12-14 weeks), but the Humane Society probably waited to put them up for adoption until they were a little older.\nI'm definitely a cat person. They're awesome.

Many people have already written about the information:\n- no milk (kittens and cats are lactose intolerant)\n- leave the kitten alone when it just arrived and allow it to settle\n- adopt at least two kittens, not only one\nWhat I haven't read yet is about the age. Adopting a kitten when it's only 6 or 8 weeks old, is way too early. Kittens must not be separated from their mother until they're at least 12 weeks old! And please make sure that neither you or a family member has an allergy against cat hair before adopting.

Also, you should point-out the importance of teaching basic commands (sit,  stay, down).  Many people let their cats get away with little/no training without seeing the complete joy of having a properly-trained cat.\nNeither of my cats had issues with milk.  They never got a lot, but a tiny bowl one or twice a month was a special treat.  Fluffy (20) even liked a little melted ice cream…when we had room in the freezer.  Tony (14) just liked a little milk, especially when he'd try to steal it from my Coonhound, Lilly.

3641,"Dear Simon's Cat friends. This is a public forum that kids looks at. Dropping F bombs arguing about cat food is ridiculous and juvenile. Remember, yours is just an opinion, not fact. Everyone is entitled to theirs. My cats are 14 ,15 and 17, are super healthy and have eaten Purina dry for half of their lives. Now they have Iams dry food. NO wet food. They have great teeth and seem really happy and playful. That works for me and them, but maybe not you. Be happy your pet is healthy and stick with what works for you. Try being nice to other people, and your pets will think you're pretty cool for acting like them.

3642,"My cat would follow my mum around every morning meowing what sounded like milk until she gave it to him. It wasn't until he got older that he had trouble with milk. He couldn't tell rice milk apart from cow milk. Either that or he didn't care. Later both he and his sister lost the ability to digest any kind of cat treat. We still wanted to reward good behavior. They had no problems with their kibble. So I simply put some kibble in a separate container. When they earned a treat, I got some from the special container. They were just as excited as if it were something other than what they always eat. So presentation was all that mattered. Cheaper too.

3808,"De La Hoya knows jack sh*t about MMA. Conor McGregor ain't sh*t an is not the very best. He ain't even top 15 in any weight and that's being honest! He's not fighting the very best. The very best he fought was Jose Aldo who hadn't lost in 7 years or more, never gave him a rematch.  He fought a scrub to win the LW title and won't fight the best now at Lightweight. He's protected.

Manny will always be younger than Floyd so waiting to fight benefited Pacquiao not Mayweather. \n\nAlso, Oacar was only 34 when he fought Floyd so ge was not over the hill. Floyd fought an in prime Cotto, Maidana and Canelo ALL after he was 34... \n\nAND! He was was the first promoter trying to get Mcgregor in the ring to v Canelo yet he mocks a Floyd Conor fight? This guy just talks out of his ass.

4783,"I will agree that the kids did an okay to a good job acting. However, I didn't believe that most of them were friends. They didn't sell the friendship in this version which it needed to. Also, I don't agree at all with the love for Pennywise here. He was way too much jump scare and the CGI was bad. Plus the voice just felt silly not scary. Tim Curry was terrifying because he made fun of their fear. Go ahead and run it won't do you any good, girly boy. He let the fact he could kill them at any second sink in. In this movie he just chased them and didn't really interact. Also, that ending where they just wail on him? No mention of a strong magical force helping them, just straight up street fighter his ass.

But definitely a truly amazing and suspense-filled movie and then some, I give it an A+ all the way across the board!!

",-1
4787,"They hardly got a single thing right from the book are you kidding? From the very beginning the piano is playing the wrong song. The mother played Fur Elise and stopped doing so after Georgie died. Now i liked the couple Easter eggs like the Turtle toy and a couple others but other than that it wasn't true to the book at all. The entire movie was all jump scares using visual jump scares and audio jump scares. There was no real creap and terror, not to mention Pennywise wasn't alluring and sneaky thus he wasn't scary. And after allll of that, they DID NOT make the people of Derry the scary part and show how fucked up the town was (Like you said they did). They had a single scene showing the actual people of Derry being shady. They also didn't explain why Henry was carving his name into Bens stomach, which there was a reason for, it wasn't just a random thing that happened. I could go on for literally ever about what was wrong with the movie but i'll save myself the effort.

I thought the movie was okay, but not nearly as great as all of the reviews say it is.\nI was wondering if I posted a video response pointing out all of the problems I had the with the movie, if you would do a rebuttal on the movie's behalf. It's not your opinion or review score you'd be defending, but the movie itself. Thought it would be fun.\nAnyway, keep up the good work!
",-1
4803,"came. back from the movie theater, wow,  I was on the edge on my seat
",1
4804,"Disagree. Massively over-hyped film. Saw it with my 17 yo daughter. Nobody in the theater was scared, nobody. The Tim Curry original is far superior. Andy Muschetti's other film MAMA, is genuinely terrifying. The new IT also suffers horribly from trailer fatigue, wit the best parts jack hammered in trailers for the last 6 months. It's not a bad film, but falls way short of what was expected.
",-1

Honestly the child-acting wasn't great, and I did not think Pennywise was all that unique or horrifying.  I was completely unengaged by the story and some of the CGI was absolutely awful. Overall there was no sense of horror or dread, and it really made this movie seem hollow.

I was looking forward to the this in the remake but it didn't happen but the I thought about it and they gave this moment to Richie in the remake when he grabs the baseball bat so that makes me think they r gonna kill richie in the  at the end instead of Eddie??????

Bill Skarsgard nails the performance. I believe Sophia Lillis is going to be an amazing actress, was blown away by her.

4846,"At first, I really liked this movie. A lot. \nIt didn't really scare me. I get that the horror could be viewed as the icing on the cake. I jumped at the jump scares, but that's because if you see something pop up in front of you, you're gonna jump. You're kinda programmed to do so. It didn't really leave me with a lingering fear though. I kinda just went home and had a good night's sleep and then didn't think about it. I actually got home and thought Well, that was a good movie. I probably won't remember it in a few years, but I enjoyed the experience. \nThere were multiple scenes I liked. The intro was good. The scene where Bev was sobbing and cutting her hair off after her father compliments it is amazing. The scene where the blood comes out of the sink was good. I liked Richie's jokes. The cinematography in many places was great. The special effects were great too. The acting was great, good casting all around.\nBut there were times when Pennywise seemed more funny than scary to me. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself at times when he was onscreen. \nThe more I thought about it, though, the more I realized it was kinda a paint-by-numbers movie. My rating got worse the more I thought about it. Now I'm just kinda at a Meh, I liked it kinda feeling. Not great, not bad, just pure entertainment for a quick thrill.

To be honest, IMHO they have not released anything remotely interesting since POP. The fact that their latest tour is on their 30 year old Joshua Tree album sort of confirms that they have accepted their irrelevance, even though they have always been amazing in concerts.

5060,"If this is a taster of the album then we can only expect something lukewarm and a little safe. When U2 stop giving a shit about being relevant then they'll write great music again. Great music is always relevant. They need to take more risks than this. I agree with a few others here, there is a lot of terrible stuff going on in the world, that's where U2 need to channel their energies. Protest songs, rebellion against Trump, against racism, the refugee crisis. Fucking hell, I dunno.

The song takes a left turn at the very end and finishes with a noticeable change in melody. This was undoubtedly done purposely (probably to minimize predictability), but some people are saying they like the song but  also say they don't like the way it ends. I noticed the change in melody at the end on my very first listen and it does throw you for a minor loop, but I genuinely love the song (and I'm a tough critic). Hats off, boys!!!

What I also love is Cartman saying that you're a newbie so you can only choose from 3 classes which means they'll have to be unlocked.

5585,"@Laidback Luke thanks for bringing this topic up and for sharing both of your perspectives on it. It's a topic that often comes up and it was cool to see some well respected artists like yourselves shed some light on it. So looking forward to one day being able to see one of your life changing live sets <3\n\n@Afrojack  I 100% agree with what you had to say. The best sets I've seen are always the ones where the DJ can read the crowd and adjust to the situation at hand. Whether it's through crowd management on the mic or simply uplifting us through a journey of beats, that is always the difference between a good set and an unforgettable experience.  \n\nI have seen you perform at least 5 times in the past 3 years in Japan and Ibiza and not once have I ever felt like I have seen the same show twice. You continually set the bar for live sets with all the hard work and effort you put into your performances. They are always fresh with new stuff to look forward to. Your show alone is always worth traveling internationally for. Much love and respect <3\n\nLastly, no disrespect to Zedd, whom I also love dearly, but I gotta say that I was so thankful you guys brought that up. The first time I ever saw him in concert (Tokyo 2016), I had goosebumps and it was truly a mind blowing experience. The second time I went to Zoukout Singapore last year for him and it was a good show but it didn't feel as amazing as the first time. 5 months later at EDC Japan, no joke it was literally song for song the same set, same visuals, and it didn't even truly match the smaller built set. As a fan who had to pay $300 for a 2 day event (general admission), I felt disrespected and I was pissed. Still love his music and the beautiful creations he makes, but damn it was shocking to feel and eye opening to see this happen when you see what else is out there with amazing artists like you guys and Martin Garrix, and how much effort you all put into your live sets. \n\nThanks again for doing a video on this! Wishing you both all the love, happiness and success in the world. <3

It's like that old school sound records make, just sounds more badass. As for forgetting to play certain tracks, put them in a 'must play' playlist? Preplanned sets etc if call performing, freestyle is DJing.

5594,"Laidback, I really love this Video. Afrojack shows the real thing in Mainstream EDM and I believe it´s in underground too. It´s hard to found Dj´s doing that for real. I know it´s good to see people jumping, we know most of the people doesn´t matter if the Dj is playing or just jumping and clap clap clap, but is a real sensation when we see someone doing that, playing for real, not push a play button. You´re very right when you said about the art, producer art is not a DJ art, but now, we see a music artists milkshake in the Big Festivals and I really miss some pitch adjusts provided by badass mixing style, but we have it in Drum N Bass and HipHop, the art is live but not in Eletronic Dance Music. I´m a Dj since 1999, and producer since 2010,  I´m an old, but I preffer the old school djs and love all the time producers.

5596,"Afrojack is right that the kids who skip everything and go right to big festivals aren't djs, because if they ever needed to switch up on the fly they wouldn't be able to, since their sets are so preplanned and they lack the necessary dj skill. He was spot on about his views of mainstage too, and if you look in the comments of tomorrowland videos its full of people criticizing, even though they weren't actually there and are taking the set out of context.

5600,"A lot of what afrojack said is true, also it all depends on what type of DJ you are, a producing DJ can get away with having a pre planed playlist cause 99% of their playlist are gonna contain their own productions as well as their own hit productions that are guaranteed to move the crowd. That's what afrojack meant by he rarely miss-plans a set. Cause he has had many hits in the past. BUT for DJs  that do not produce and do not have there own hit songs to depend on, most of those type of djs must DJ on the fly. They don't want to play what previous djs that night may have played. So it also does depend on who you are and what type of DJ are you.

5607,"I agree 100% with the difference between club and festival events. I worked at Omnia Las Vegas for the 1st two years it opened & as someone who gets to see each artist every time they perform at the venue, you start to realize the difference between who is a DJ & who is just a producer. For instance, Calvin Harris nights are always the busiest at the nightclub but for someone who sees him every Friday night they get bored of seeing him because his sets are exactly the same to the point where I could tell you what songs he was going to play & when he was going to play them. Then you have artists like Krewella, Chuckie, Martin Garrix, & Afrojack who either plays completely different sets (actually djing) or what I've noticed with Afrojack, to where he plays a portion of the same set then (Usually once he starts drinking out the bottle) starts to freestyle. You can hear him trying new things, not always having a flawless set. Me personally I like it when I can hear a dj messing up from time to time because that shows you they are actually Djing, trying new things, living in the moment & their thoughts in real time & not just acting & pretending to turn knobs. Another reason why DJ Mag Top 100 isn't an accurate source for the best DJ's but that's a whole different discussion for another time.

I've been a huge fan of EDM my whole life and, being a dj myself, when I go watch a set, I not only have a good time, I listen to exactly what the artists are doing. I am part of the 10%. I live in Miami and I HATE festivals like Ultra Miami. Artists go out to Ultra to bust out the craziest sets they've ever performed, but I don't feel the vibe and love of a festival at all. It just feels like a huge party filled with drunk and drugged out people. Seldom are there festivals where you can feel that the crowd around you really love the music that's playing as much as you do. And it's at these festivals where the artists and the fans really have a good time and feel the PLUR vibes

5617,"I like to play with no playlist, I like the improvisation and feel the club, when a song that you play for example, the old one, was just a pinch on your set, but the dancefloor likes it so much that at the time you includ 3 more songs, this can only be done in the heat of the moment! But, I really feel the need to think about a set for a great show, now sometimes I have a VJ together and I already see the need to think in advance about some transitions and some songs that have cool visual effects for the public to see on the big screen. Today the DJ is not only music, it is a entertainment show and in this case a planning and a DJ planned up to a certain point is essential for the operation of all the functions of a great show.
",1
5618,"I'm not a DJ, i'm an artist and producer but I've been asked to perform and I did just that, performed. Today's DJ's are performers and there are those that are crazy talented such as: Youngr, Araab Musik, Arcane Echo, etc. those guys are all reinventing the wheel when it comes to performance. I believe DJ'ing got washed down with technology -- Most of what you learned Afro and LL respectively, has all been tucked into a simple button anyone can press BUT Your advantage is that you can read a crowd and your mental library are skills that no technology can replace. SO it's not DJing it's performing and if you want to see DJ'ing like you said go to a club or place where it's intimate.

5619,"I've been DJing on and off for half my life (17 years as none of you will know my age), and done all sorts (mostly weddings these days, but that's by the by). Max crowd of about 1000, but in the last few months I've done some last minute (a few hours notice) sets in local venues, one was 30mins notice. There are people who are better than me at reading a crowd, I don't deny that, but at a few hours or less' notice (and with a young family at home) I just have a load of playlists in iTunes to group tracks by year (and if I have some notice, categories of music I know are popular / relevant). The order isn't fixed though - I may be a fan of doing certain tracks into other tracks, but if the crowd don't take to the first track of a usual selection I'll deviate. I do a fair bit of lighting and event production work, so I can fully appreciate knowing what's coming next - mostly in the clubs (even for Ministry of Sound tour DJs), it's mostly busking. But when I see a track is coming in that I know, that I know almost inside out, and I can see on a CDJ / Serato etc display when the kick drums etc are, then I can make it a damn good freestyle lighting etc performance to add extra impact to the sound

5624,"Each side has their place, especially when dealing with big festivals. After all, it's about what the crowd came for, right? However, it's discouraging that the fundamental art of DJing is dying. And I think it has to do with: \n\n- EDM becoming more pop and mainstream over the years, attracting a larger audience than before. \n- Technology has made it now easier than ever for anyone to be a DJ. Thus, the advanced skill set is becoming lost. \n\nThank you guys for continuing to be an inspiration for all the die hard fans while still giving the masses what they want to hear!
",1
5625,"So wack! Then what are you doing up there on stage? It's like paying to go watch Adele lip sync.
",1
5626,"Sorry for the booklet but here is my opinion/story:\nFirst off mad respect to those who dj on the fly with no preparation whatsoever. It takes guts to get up on stage and read the energy of the crowd an put together your set right there. to me this means you are comfortable with all the songs you have and have been DJing long enough to know what certain song will mix well into others, what songs will easily mix into other genres etc.\n\nI just mixed for the first all school party of the year at my university a couple days ago it was huge and of course very fun. However, I primarily produce music (deep house) and I've only mixed live for an audience 4 or 5 times before. I have seen many times people put together their own mix in Ableton or Logic  and then go up and press play one time and act like the were djing. and in a sense its a little frustrating to go up on stage after those people knowing they had no risk of screwing up.\n\n With that said, I spent a good deal of time practicing my set. I took time to figure out what songs would mix the absolute best into others so my set was as clean as possible. While I guess you wouldn't consider this DJing to me it is still mixing. I was still forced to find creative ways to switch tempos, and to change keys. It was just rehearsed.\n\nwhile I am positive I would be able to get up on stage and put together a mix on the fly (I do it in my room all the time), Im not sure the set would have  the same clarity and cohesiveness that my set had, and in a way I actually feel good about all the hours I spent preparing for this set knowing that it all came together exactly as planned and sounded good. So in a way it is a modification of the art. in my opinion I will respect someone who takes the time to carefully pick how their songs will mix together. the only people I won't respect are those who put their set together in a daw and felt pressed play once

5641,"Not sure about this. I really understand that you dont want to fuck up in front of a million crowd. However, making a mistake every now on then on stage proves that it is live what the DJ is doing their stuff on stage. The perfect live set is different to everyone. I would prefer Afrojack playing crazy shit instead of ten feet tall, because you hear the hits (don't get me wrong, I really like them) all the time. And when I'm there I want to experience a live set with music that is beyond the regular stuff.
",1
5642,"I started djing 5 years ago and I find it a lot more fun to mix live than have a prerecorded set. You can learn from your mistakes , as they said you can play in on the crowd to see what they like , they know you're a real dj and so on.  I mean it's just way more fun to see all people going wild on a set you played live than just pressing play and acting like it's live. It gives me a much better feeling about myself.
",1
5643,"I know that the real form of DJing is very important and that is what represents how talented a DJ is. But now, as times changed... Being like Afrojack is what I would suggest. Does anyone realize that the preparation Afrojack is talking about requires talent? People will discuss how your playlist was, How the production was. Not how well a DJ scratched and Mashed up acapellas. So I would like to say that Preparing like Afrojack is also an art. Hope you will like what I said Afrojack & Luke

5645,"why there is this common idea that the crowd wants to hear always big banger hits ?? when i am at a live event i want to feel the beat, the bass, i dont want to hear the same shit again and again because i can listen to it every fuckin day on my phone ,on my pc ecc.. i like when a dj actually mixes and does something live , i hate when he has the mic in his hands and waves his hands saying 1,2,3, jump... this summer i went to a martin garrix event and i didnt appreciate every second of it becuase it was a clearly pre-recorded set, that's the main reason why i dont like edm. if you go to a techno  event, is totally different, djs play whatever they fuckin want and i can enjoy always new sounds, new mashups and something that's is real and different.

Naar mate het volk toeneemt ga ik dan iets harder te werk, bv een black out van franky rizzardo  of een tujamo nummer. Als er veel vrouwen aanwezig zijn kan je naar r&b overschakelijk etc. en dat wissel je dan af, om je set creatief te houden. Als ik bv op een event speel waar ik 1 of 2uur draai dan zal ik mijn set voorbereiden door bv een afspeellijst te maken in recordbox en evt cue punten aan te duiden. Dit geeft dan een houvast aan wat je gaat spelen en door te weten wat je gaat spelen of toch ongeveer, kan je je extra richten op het technische.

5666,"Almost every song you hear a DJ play has been pre recorded in a studio anyway, so a pre recorded set is no different, it just means the DJ isn't mixing live, therefore no errors or playing songs that don't mix well, giving a much more polished performance. A few DJ's actually create music during their performance, James Zabeila and Paul Van Dyk for example, that's as close as you can get to truly organic DJ'ing. Superstar DJ's can drop The Crazy Frog into the middle of a set and the crowd will still go wild so I don't really agree with this reading a crowd nonsense, maybe unknown DJ's in clubs have to read the crowd and definitely Wedding DJ's but superstar DJ's no.
",-1
5667,"In its purest form Djing is an art. To be able to read a crowd, take them on a journey, draw tunes on the fly and seamlessly blend them takes years to master - John Digweed being a great example. At the commercial level (where Afrojack is) the art of djing is irrelevant because it's all about promoters and djs making big money by giving the masses what they want - which appears to be EDM garbage. I have no problem with people making bank, just don't proclaim to be an artist or be pushing the art of djing forward by having pre-recorded sets. I take my hat off to any dj and/or producer staying true to their craft and mastering it without selling out, because whatever they lack in earnings, their back catalogue and sets stand the test of time. Just look at Goldie (Metalheadz) and Andy C (Ram Records)  - the latter were pioneers but sold out and as a result their sets and output over recent years are a million miles away from their previous bar setting standards.

5871,"Q. Why did you choose to build MTG Arena instead of a new Magic Online client?\n\nA. There were a lot of advantages to starting fresh with MTG Arena. The team is building the game in Unity, which gives us more flexibility for future growth. We created a new Game Rules Engine that can better understand even the most obscure card interactions. We wanted to integrate modern online services that will create a dynamic overall experience and also someday integrate with other aspects of your Magic life.\n\n\nI know wizards is a business, but this is just pure greed. They might as well not candy coat it and just say the real answer..... $$$$$
",1
5872,"The voices are wayyy to low..

Keep in mind that important detail, uncertainty over a company and its products always leads to a downfall. Like if you Agree.
",1
5877,"Well this is nothing short of hideous. Don't get me wrong, I'll try any magic product, but digitalised mtg cards look fugly. Should've just looked like collapsible HD scans. If they were trying to be modern they should've gone and make a completely new look for them, but the modo vibe is just painful to look at.

5885,"I could be wrong, but I don't think most players care about these useless visuals and sound effects. We just want a more intuitive and functional version of MTGO. And you can improve aesthetics without making this into a hearthstone clone. Keep things simple and elegant.
",1
5886,"I feel that if Wizards doesn't have the resources to address the existing bugs in MTGO, I can't imagine dividing them and also adding in fancy visual effects will make development any faster. I honestly enjoy MTGO and I could recommend it more if there weren't so many bugs and slow downs. I hope this full rules engine or whatever delivers and makes it easier on their end as well.

5887,"It looks realyl amazing for Beta, can`t wait to get my hands on this. I used to play Magic mostly in the Theros-Tarkir expansions, but then it was becoming a bit too much for me, if this works as I am imafining, this will be my MTG comeback.

5914,"Magic the gathering doesn't need sound efects and flashy animations.
",0
5915,"These sound effects are terrible. The animations are ten times worse. The cards not tapping is a disaster, it's way easier to absorb the board state by seeing a fully tapped card than it is to check for the tap symbol on each card. The text being completely hidden on each card doesn't actually make for a more streamlined experience, it actually makes it more confusing and time consuming when you need to go hover over several cards when you need to make a decision in game. Playing with square pictures is not more appealing than playing with something that actually looks like a Magic card.

",1
5939,"If I may make one request, give one piece of feedback in an attempt to move WotC away from a direction I fear they may be taking here, it's this: please, do not try to compete with Hearthstone or other born-digital card games in terms of the things they can do in a digital format. That is, leverage what makes Magic different from those games: the depth of gameplay due to extremely limited variance. You guys learned a long time ago that randomness is inversely correlated to strategy level. That's why coin-flip effects are so rare now and library manipulation so valuable. Digital card games use randomness as an inherent part of their mechanics and gameplay, and that is not where Magic should go. I understand that paper Magic is not going away, but my fear is that WotC will use the crutch of a digital format as an excuse (or maybe just a subconscious justification) for reintroducing more variance into the game, knowing that they will be able to translate those mechanics into a digital format. This is the exact opposite of what needs to be done. Digital versions of MtG must be vessels by which to convey the core gameplay to wider audiences, and the focus must still be completely on developing compelling mechanics that work in paper and have low variance.

When there was no legacy, extended, modern, commander, pauper or standard... Just Magic.. To me, Arena feels very authentic and in the spirit of the game. I understand new players don't experience this nostalgia, but keep it civil everyone. Provide constructive feedback to the game via the Beta. Trolling doesn't improve the game we all love.

6468,"Ladies and gentlemen, you may have to adjust the color of your monitors...it is definitely a yellow strap! Haha...I didn't realize it would be so controversial. Pull up the Wiki shot of it and it's pretty obvious.\n(You can also judge based on the brown underpieces that Link wears as a part of that outfit as well, plus the little laces in front at his neck...the hat to me was the most obvious, though)\n\nAlso, just to clarify: A lot of people are saying It's obvious it's Fallen Hero because Link wakes up in a Reincarnation Chamber. Technically, you can't use that as evidence here because the Hero is Defeated division is specifically related to Link losing at the end of Ocarina of Time against Ganon, NOT the battles described in BOTW.\n\nLastly, a lot of people are mentioning the appearance of the Mirror of Twilight in the form of the Fragmented Monument. And that's a really good point, however, if you look at the Fragmented Monument in BOTW, its design is pretty strongly different from the Mirror, in particular the writing in an ancient language around the rim of the circle. \n\nCould the timelines have united and this is at the end of them? That's actually what I was hoping for as I researched! Sadly, I just didn't feel like there was enough evidence to support that. When I stopped to look at all the evidence together as well as how Eiji Aonuma was talking about this game leading up to its launch, it felt like the team INTENDED this to be a return to that first timeline while making nods to the other games.

6476,"Hey MatPat, I just wanted to send a message suggesting a game called La Mulana. It has a great plot based on ancient historical information and I think it'd be a really cool way to tie a lot of games together in an awesome theory. For example: Michael Jackson makes an appearance scrawled on a wall in the ancient ruins of La Mulana meaning that he is among the earlier children birthed by the mother and a separate race from our own. This connection to the real world also adds a cool background to the every game is in every universe theory by making every thing birthed by the Mother or maybe even related to her. Anyway yeah, I think it could make a cool theory and would also be a game you'd enjoy.
",1
6477,"but MatPat what about the side quest where you have to find the missing pieces of the twilight portal, the bridge where Farosh flies near is the same bridge from Twilight not only that but also why does Zelda know about the Twilight realm. plus you watch Link's coronation in German. with all these evidence it proves that your theory would be wrong and the only real explanation would be a time convergence of some sorts. The creator hints that the game might be in a timeline of it's own or it's CONNECTED to all of the other timelines.

6485,"There isn't any concrete proof that this theory is true. I mean sure, there are a lot of subtle hints to patterns, but other than that? There's a lot more proof for it being in the child time line.  The mirror of twilight can be found in the game and even put together. And the line zelda says is still solid post-translation because as you said yourself the sea could mean the sea that was in the lanayru region before the desert was there. There's two pieces of solid proof that it's in the child time line and only subtle hints that it's in the game over or adult time line. \n\nAlso this is unrelated but in Hyrule historia it's stated that the reason the zoras evolved into rito after the great sea appeared was because the gods feared that they would find Hyrule so they forced them to evolve.

In the child and failure timelines, this never could have come to pass, as each of the sages were, themselves, sealed away.

Remember that Breath of the Wild is a game will with 900 references and very little can actually be taken as concrete evidence since quite literally everything is a nod to any game in the series. While you may have a belief that the game is in one timeline, there is just as much evidence otherwise. Breath of the Wild's timeline placement no matter where you put it, will never be satisfying.

6543,"What if Breath of the Wild was the three timelines coming back together again. And the split in the was only temporary. This could also be related to the games itself because there are a multiple of ways to play through the game, and everyone plays the games differently, but the ending is all the same. Could that be what the timelines are doing? Could it all be one big game that took different paths on how to complete it, but it all came together in the end when Calamity Gabon was introduced. That could also be proved by Breath of the Wild having similarities with all three of the timelines. Ex. The races of the creature being different in different games and timelines, the reference to twilight princess and wind waker series, and the line given before the Gurdo champion was about to shoot Calamity Ganon about her getting revenge for him taking the form of a Gurdo male. I know there is a more examples scattered through the game to back up this theory, but these instances were the first to come to my mind. What do you guys think?

After checking g the source code... Some thing creepy happened. The code read: You are crowding us...You can't tell us what to do anymore...We outnumber you...We found a way to eject you...Ha ha! Say goodbye to our friend. Yep! Scott has lost his mind! But when I thought about it, it became more crazy. The last sentence... Say good bye to OUR friend Not your friend, OUR friend. Odd right?

Yet he is dealing with almost the same situation here and he has no issue calling out Zach Snyder and saying its impossible. Where are the preposterous claims this time? Whats the difference? I'm not a fan of either franchise so i have no stake in either theory, it just seems odd to me that he would basically approach the same problem twice in a month and clearly place more effort in filling one hole than the other. I mean people are just twice as big in Game of Thrones come on. It would've made more sense to say that days are longer or their concept of distance is shorter.

6853,"Honestly. I'm not the biggest fan. But I'm glad you didn't love the movie as well. Honestly I didn't like it that much. As a wonder woman movie. It's decent. DECENT. O couldn't even finish it. But it was a poor choice for the very first live action Wonder Woman movie. I have an issue with your theory. Themesciran boats are blessed by the gods so they can travel great distances quickly. I believe in another movie they traveled from their island to NYC in a span of a few hours it's literally a miracle. I believe the message was weird though. I mean Wonder Woman does stand for truth because she left to learn the truth of man's world but what you believe? Then anything is true and nothing is false unless you don't believe it? But truth is fact and that will make truth an opinion. I will proceed to why this movie was trash now. \n\n1.) They killed Steve Trevor \n2.) If they were gonna make this movie the way it was they should have changed her outfit. Wonder Woman was dawned with the colours of the American flag because Steve Trevor was an AMERICAN pilot(who had the flag stitched on to his uniform) and Hypolita(Diana's mum) suggested they made her armor in the other nation's colours to show they meant peace. PLUS Amazon's don't wear blue armour. They wear reds and golds and Hypolita as the queen wears royal purples occasionally(she wears white for some reason. A colour of purity which she is not). \n\n2.) Plot. No more. \n\n3.) What even is Aries' look rn... \n\n4.) Completely uninteresting \n5.) Basically my main problem so that they didn't keep it true to Wonder Woman herself. It's why I got mad when she could suddenly fly in the comics. Like amazons are humans gifted with great strength and immortality(as long as they stay on their island and aren't killed). It's why I ranted so much a bit the Germany/Clothed thing. They didn't stay true to her character and that movie was literally most likely the first wonder woman movie a lot of people have seen.. \n\n\n\nAnyhow the animated wonder woman of 2009 is by far superior and the theme suits Diana better than the recent one. Watch that if you want a good ww movie with phenomenal music.

",-1
6856,"Since this movie acts on the premise that Greek Gods exist, then Poseidon would exist too. He and Ares are not always on the best terms, and this war might not be in his best interest.

Sometimes when I'm watching youtubers and especially videos where they collaborate, I get the feeling they aren't really that comfortable with eachother. It can feel a bit awkward, a bit like when acquaintances end up having to hang out alone together. You two aren't like that, you seem completely comfortable around eachother and appear to genuinely have fun. Which makes these videos so nice to watch. Maybe it's because you are both individually down-to-earth people. Anyway, so glad I found you both, not sure why it took me so long. (Long comment, sorry)

Throughout that time, I felt as if I related to Bojack, but couldn't give a specific reason of why. This video helps give insight on the qualities I used to, and ultimately do still see in myself. Especially the point about his cyncism reaching the point of a self-destructive loop, and being the root of his suicidal and depressive tendencies. Thank you for the video.. excellent breakdown and analysis, and is personally helpful to me.

7090,"The tragedy of Bojack Horseman isn't that he can't love himself, it's that he thinks love is conditional. This is probably why his so obsessed with fame, because he thinks fame will make him worthy of love. But that's not how it works, if Bojack wants unconditional love then he should unconditionally love himself and the people around him, it may not get him what he wants but it would make a better person... or a better horse.

7092,"My life is like Bojack Horseman, as far as wanting change, being aware of my flaws. Yet, something inside is stopping me from making the actual effort to make things better. I only care about music, making music, or creative writing. I'm the same way, repeating the same things everyday expecting different results, expecting things to get better. That's why I love this show.

I'm a massive fan of both, but I find the irony in how paranoidly U2 is obsessed w having a radio hit, so much so that they second-guess themselves to the point where it takes them 3 years to finish an album which they said was complete back in 2014, w the lead single being more in the meh category than the sheer song-craft that they're more than capable of, trying to solve the problem by hiring pop-friendly producers. All the while, Beck writes an amazing song like this (as well as the other singles from his forthcoming, HIGHLY anticipated new album), producing it on his own. Yeah, he delayed its release by a year, but he still did all of the songwriting, as well as the bulk of the instrumentation on his own, on top of the production work.\n\nIn short, if U2 still feel like not returning to the powerhouse duo of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, they should try hiring Beck as their next producer!

If his tail is engineered with that freely rotating tailbone joint then his tails were likely also engineered with that shaped. \n\nThe fur might even help to smooth out the airflow, though it'd be hard to get it into a wing shape at those speeds. Probably has some feather-like hardened fur at the bottom to flatten out the bottom edge. Wouldn't be noticeable when not in use because the fluffiness of his tail hides it.

The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth.

The amount of DNA any individual inherits from relatives just a few steps up their family tree is negligible compared with the vast amount we all share from common ancestors. It means any ancestral history identified by a simple genetic test is just one of dozens of possible interpretations, and to try to trace our lineage directly through our genes is absurd. We are better off conducting our own investigations and creating a family tree to view our history. This kind of DNA testing seems to be heavily promoted at present, but they are fundamentally a scam.

9262,"Eh... perhaps Penguim books contributed to part of it's success, but the argument simply doesn't hold water by itself.\nThere are some key factors in To Kill a Mocking Bird that several literary staples and cases of explosive success and endurance also usually have:\n\nA somewhat subversive style for the time. As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\n\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\n\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success.

9673,"CinemaSins, I've got one you can add. In the scene when the crew was walking through the wheat, one of the crew members appears to be eating the wheat. Mind you, not one crew member conducted any kind of analysis before hand to even determine if the wheat was edible and yet, one of them is eating it. I know this is a work of fiction but really?! Another problem I had with this film is its trying to be Event Horizon. If you recall, the crew on that ship were following a beacon signal and not knowing or understanding its origin or who even made it. The rescue team has little to go on and have no idea of the evil they're about to face. Yep, its Event Horizon all over again.

Each of them sharing moments with us, however temporary it may seem. Some people (like the old man who misses the lift) could have been have a part of our lives, if time wanted them to be so, or sometimes we neglect the chance to let them in. \n\nWonderful video!

Ну да, лифт, и что? он что приватизировал использование лифтов в клипах? короче, клип Машины - самобытный, интересный и для 2001 года снят просто потрясающе, как по мне, у Radiohead - самобытный, интересный, потрясающий клип.

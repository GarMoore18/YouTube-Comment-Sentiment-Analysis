Let’s all take a moment of silence for the 19M dislikes before they get removed 😌
That opening hits a little different now.
Seeing Will Smith at the beginning of a Rewind just slaps! Not as hard as he did to Chris Rock apparently
People in 2021: here for the dislikes People in 2022: here for Will Smith
Will wishes he could rewind time now.
The countdown for all 19 million dislikes being removed starts now 🥺
Little update: According to the return YouTube dislikes chrome extension, this video has 3 million likes, and 20 million dislikes as of Friday, March 18th
This felt like a slap in the face
This slaps harder now.
Glad Will finally got his Oscar! He was robbed back in 2018. The part where he talked about Fortnite and Marques Brownlee still gives me chills. Timeless
For the future generations - This video had 19M dislikes in 2021.
I'm actually kinda impressed how they manage to make me cringe thoughout the whole video. Great job!

Man, Will’s performance in YouTube rewind SLAPPED…
Chris: *makes joke* Will: *laughs* Wills wife: *rolls eyes* Will: "it's rewind time"
Will should've slapped YouTube staff instead for hiding dislikes.
"Yaaaah, it's smack time" - Will Smith probably
those 19M dislikes will never be forgotten. R.I.P. 🪦
0 dislikes? Damn this must be a really good rewind. Makes me question why they cancelled rewind forever
Will Smith in 2018: ¡Ah! Is rewind time Will Smith in 2022: ¡Ah! Is SLAPP time
Remember When *THIS* Was Will Smith's Most Embarrassing Moment ?
Shoutout to the 20M people who SLAPPED the dislike button.
Yaaaaaa, it's slapping time
YouTube Rewind is now not the dumbest decision in Will Smith’s career.
YouTube protecting it’s video’s from dislikes like Will Smith protecting his wife…. In the most cowardly way possible…
That opening slaps hard
They can’t get rid of me.
He seems like the kind of dude that would slap a comedian, that first guy, you feel me?
The beginning slaps now
Chris Rock: *dislikes this video Will Smith: *gets revenge three years later
2018: It's rewind time 2022: It's slapping time
2018: we tried but failed horribly 2019: we didn’t even try 2020: we didn’t even make one
Will Smith definitely wishes he could rewind time now
That opening hits different after the Oscars
0:10 Will Smith is thinking this after the Oscars.
Will Definitely Needs A Rewind After What He Did...
Press F to pay respects for the 19M dislikes.
Damn this kinda slaps now for some reason
Yeaaaaah, it’s Oscar smash time
This video is so good. And without a single dislike. Amazing. Wish we could all make such universally praised videos
*The meme guy* is back with a punch Watching after 2022 Oscar
You can hide the dislikes, but you can't hide the cringe!!!!
when this is no longer Will Smith's biggest mistake:
The intro slaps tbf
Damn this slaps.

Eliminating dislikes is one of the worst ideas they have ever had, but it seems that for years they have been competing to do the wrong thing

The only reason they removed dislikes was to protect their image. They couldn’t care less about anyones opinion.

weird to think that the guy introducing the video has an academy award now
No Chris Rock's were harmed in the making of this video.

The irony is that YouTube created the most disliked video on YouTube. Can't get enough of that.

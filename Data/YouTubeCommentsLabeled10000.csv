23,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.

131,"These tests are antirely useless and give you wrong or misleading answers. There are no Swedish, Britisch, German or French genes. People have moved thousands of years around the world and there was always a mixture of genes. So how could you say that a specific gene is British?  This is what the companies say: We compared your DNA results to the reference populations we currently have in our database and estimated which of these were most similar to you in terms of the genetic markers you carry. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you belong to these groups or are directly from these regions, but that these groups were a similar genetic match.\nSo be careful what you think this test tells you.

What is your least favourite boy and girl's name from the top UK names list (2015)?* \nBoy: Oliver\nGirl: Jessica\n\n2. If you had twins, what would you name them? (G/G, B/B, B/G) \nG/G: Delilah, Vivienne\nB/B: Atticus, Emmett\nG/B: Delilah/Atticus\nI don't always think twins need to have matching names, so I just picked names I like.\n\n3. If you could change your name to anything, what would it be? \nI wouldn’t; I actually love my name. Maybe Louise as my first instead of middle name\n\n4. You have 4 children, any gender. Their first names all have to start with the same letter. What would their names be? \nStart with A; Atticus, Autumn, Ava, Aldous (2 boys, 2 girls)\n\n5. What's your favourite animal-inspired name? \nWren\n\n6. What's your favourite colour-inspired name? \nViolet\n\n7. What are your top 3 favourite boy names? \nAtticus, Emmett, Elijah\n\n8. What are your top 3 favourite girl names? \nDelilah, Autumn, Vivienne\n\n9. What is your favourite celebrity baby name? \nBowie\n\n10. What is your ultimate guilty pleasure name? \nI don’t know that any of them are guilty pleasures. Maybe Persephone or Kadijah\n\n\n11. What are your most hated baby names? \nVery common names usually/very traditional names. John, George, Elizabeth, Kaitlyn, etc. \n\n12. Choose a baby name based on a food/drink.(whoops I missed this one!) \nI don’t know that I have one based on a food or drink that I love. I guess you can eat a lot of flowers so maybe Acacia or Daisy or something like that. Naming a child after food or drink makes me think someone has a child called chicken or steak or spaghetti or something\n\n13. Choose a baby name based on a month. \nAugust\n\n14. Choose a baby name from a movie. \nOphelia (Hamlet is a movie right?)\n\n15. Choose a name that is already in your family.\nForrest - well it's my partner's name. Blood family, probably Niamh or Kieran.

895,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades.

The secret service always cock blocking you. when you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches you smiling at her and immediately blows shit out if proportion speculating that you are somehow breaking international law with your awkward teenage flirting, so you have to testify before congress that you didn't give away any top secret documents to her and are made to admit live on C-SPAN that you've never even kissed a girl . Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis. So you end up squirming a little since you are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people are saying you look like a fucking mental patient and you start to think you'll never get any pussy. #YIAYfetish

1305,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic

1310,"I disagree that the B757 is showing age, the 767 flew before it and it's still in high transatlantic use. Plus they're fuel efficient, so there's no need. If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable.

1319,"People are willing to pay more for greater speed or greater comfort... if they can afford it.  Wages have been flat for nearly a generation, so it's no wonder there isn't a huge market demanding supersonic flight.\n\nWhen I went to Hawaii I paid a little extra for a non-stop flight, and I'd have been willing to pay a little extra to make the trip in four hours instead of eight (oh my aching butt!).  But a supersonic flight, even if one had been available (it wasn't), wouldn't have cost *a little extra* but probably would have been *twice* as expensive, and I couldn't afford that.\n\nIf we want supersonic airliners, luxurious airliners, gigantic airliners, we need to get wages up.  If and when there is a market for such things, Boeing and Airbus and others will build them.

1333,"Your comments are very American and Wester European centric. The vast majority of future aircraft sales will be mostly in Asia since that's where the largest number of people live. In places like China and India which both have large populations and large surface areas, the more relevant point is one that you briefly touched on, namely the hyper loop. If that technology matures quickly, than it's far more likely that ere will be vast hyper loop networks rather than electric commuter aircraft. Also, why are you comparing aircraft with buses? They are completely on the opposite side of either an economic or technological discussion.

1336,"There are currently people talking about a possible Airbus A322 which would be a streteched A321 (more seat capacity) combined with an all new wing. This might be Airbus' answer to the MOM problem. The advantage would be a light and relatively cheap plane (compared to twin-aisle) and fleet-commonality with A319, A320 and A321 (minimizing extra-costs of sub-fleets). The disadvantage would be slower (de-)boarding, because of the single aisle and a tube-feel inside.

1338,"As I'm Japanese and living in Tokyo, frequently going to Osaka to see my friend, airplane's cheaper if you book it early. The bullet train doesn't have earlt discounted ticket like most of European countries do. And, the electric airplane sounds great but Tokyo-Osaka (Itami) route, JAL and ANA use B777-200, 300 or 787-9. 777-300 is configurated with about 500 seats. It's not like London Edinburgh. Japanese domestic flights are mostly operated by twin aisle aircrafts, so electric plane is pretty much impossible in capacity way.

1349,"besides competition is coming from comac (c919) & bombardier (cs-series) for the reigional market and airbus actually has something to fill in the gap, the a330 (albeit a bit too big) , and the a320 line sort of fit this gap, the range is fine but still shorter than the 757, and the capacity falls a bit short, the neo capacity is even worse\nthe thing about the 757 is that, the range and passenger ratio is just in-line (7000km~ with 220-240 pax), so its hard to replace\npeople might say the 767 is a replacement, the 200 yeah (250-290 pax), but they're also getting old and is still a bit too large, worse - the newer models are even bigger\nalso there is the A350-800 which could be a replacement, but ppl forgot that they can carry up to 440 pax, which in low demand routes doesnt make that much sense.\nso really the airline industry needed a single aisle plane on the 240-260 pax capacity with a range of over 7000km with an impressive fuel efficiency\ngod dammit boeing and airbus, shrink your planes\n\nother consideration is a possible combi type of plane, which 250~ is reserved for pax and the rest is for cargo, i mean that, on high demand times, could generate money, both from cargo and pax and thats a win-win in my eye\n\n\nidk why but everytime even on a supposedly non bias video there is a bias from the outside perspective of\nif it aint boeing i ain going

1351,"Actually, flying from Edinburgh to London is cheaper than the train (which are horrifically expensive in the UK now) - but people don't fly because the train can be quicker once you factor in airport security, waiting, etc and the fact that both airports are well outside their respective cities. People who fly tend to either be connecting in Heathrow, or live / work nearby. Working on the train is also more comfortable (a table the laptop fits on, power, wifi, decent coffee, etc for the entire journey).

1354,"Sure, planes are faster than trains - if you don't count the hour you have to be there before take-off and the travel time to the airport, which is usually out of the way and probably not even in your city (plus transit to your final destination)…\n\nFor travelling from western Germany to the south it takes me a total of ~4-4.5h total travel time when using the plane and 4-5h when using the train. When taking into account that the train is _considerably_ more comfortable (more leg room, free to walk around at all times, no changing transportation three times, no long waits, ) I just don't see air travel ever beating the rail unless it gets considerably cheaper (which probably won't happen, since any advantage in electric transport that improves ticket prices for planes is bound to also improve them for trains ).

1360,"I note this trend of planes spending so much time in the air that the _passengers_ are becoming increasingly interested in sleep.  Not the _crew;_ the _passengers._  I understand that planes are equipped to provide for the sleep needs of the pilot, the copilot, the navigator and the flight attendants, but what research is being done into providing for the sleep needs of _passengers?_  If we have a plane that is going to be in the air so long that there is no realistic way to ask a passenger to remain seated for the duration, and instead, it's more practical to provide them with _beds,_ can we foresee a day when this is a practical reality?
",-1
1361,"I highly doubt electrification is achievable for flight (at anything past prototype) and even if it was it's doubtful it would be cheaper than avgas. Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast.

1369,"I have a couple issues with this video.\nThe question is not how much oil we have left but how much of it we may still burn.\nIf we keep drilling for and burning fossile oil at the same rate right now it will very soon let the effects of it, specifically global warming exponentionally worsen. It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later.

2033,"Hi Bubz! I have watched you since before you were married and I am basically committed to watching your videos still, I love it so much! I'm sure you guys know what you're doing but due to my own past experiences i sort of became worried for Lala because my mom tried her best not to neglect my older brother and instead she neglected me. even giving me to my grandma really did some damage to me because i didn't know what a mother's love was supposed to be like growing up. Again, i think you guys know what you're doing and i only see glimpses of what goes on, through your videos. But please don't let ayla be removed from your presence for too long or she could feel disconnected with you, as to this day (been praying for God to restore my family) i have felt disconnected with my own family. please do keep me in prayer as well as you can see i need it, haha. anyway, it was a small worry, but i'm sure you guys know what you're doing, and i'm sorry if this came off the wrong way. God bless you and your beautiful family!!! Love youuu!! <3

But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy.

What I have observed in the last 10 years is that smartphones narrow peoples perception of the world. Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems. It generates anti-social behavior and I hate the smart phone concept for that.\n\nThis video was especially entertaining because it sounded like Johnny Ives from apple..

2110,"Its not the technology, but the way people use it. A phone can be used to shoot a video for a project or to create music with creativity, or even draw a picture, which creates a platform to express yourself that anyone can access. Or it can be used as a crutch where you can't even think for yourself and rely on social media as a way to feel apart of something. We can't blame the corporations for profiting off the ignorance of the masses, thats just how human nature is. Its the job of people to elevate their own consciousness to become self aware enough to determine a life they want to live.

That's not alright at all, either hate all the words or hate none. I'm sick and tired of these drama whores holding one word above the rest when THEY don't even know why. It's not fair for one slip of the tongue to ruin a man's career.\n\nI understand pewdiepie didn't drop the N-word as a joke, but it's not like anybody says faggot as a joke either. The same people who hate pewdiepie for saying the N-word are willing to say faggot in a truly offensive way without any hatred towards the gay community and they fail to see the hypocrisy in that?\n\nIf you agree, thanks.

Yes, saying the N word is not a good thing and definitely a racial slur, but it doesnt seem as it was being used as one, just like how many popular streamers insult through a variety of ways. The people that are getting SUPER upset with him, probably did not like him in the first place and are using it as a way to attack him.\n\nOh well, I am just going to enjoy my popcorn :D

As a person who also has anxiety and gets panic attacks it was quite difficult to make the link as I thought all of my symptoms were a combination of PMS and anxiety but through reading into it, it's obvious to me that that is what I have. Would love to see a video on how PMS makes you feel, more tips on how you deal with it and have us all have a chat about it in the comments because whether it be PMS or PMDD it can be very negative and lonely going through it.

I was just really loving this video (and for quite a while her whole channel as well) up to that point, so seeing her give him a shoutout kind of caught me off guard. Maybe I'm getting biased info, but from what I''ve read he's a bigot... or at least not the man he appears to be from her description ... I hate that this is the first comment I've made on one of her videos, but I thought it was important. Side note: Please know that I love Melanie and all of her videos/work.

I feel like people forget that white people don't all have the same skincolor or the same undertones. And if i do find the perfect shade by some miracle it freaking oxidises.

I'm a few years older and i cannot remember this ever being an issue when i was a kid. Parents dressed their kids in whatever they felt like. I had a Thomas the tank engine cardigan and postman pat jumper that i would happily wear when i was wearing a pretty frock. Many friends and relatives would have hand me down toys and clothes that weren't necessarily the 'right' gender for them. But they didn't care. Why? Because they were a damn kid and stuff like that didn't matter. If you're trying to force a teenage boy to wear a dress then that's another story. Sometimes things like clothes and toys are gendered. Get over it. Buy what you feel like.

2948,"Hi Sammi! I'm not sure if you'll see this but I'm about 4 months postpartum with my second and with my first I had a lot of postpartum depression and anxiety so I was determined to handle it better the next time around. I've been taking Evening Primrose Oil supplement (it's suppose to help regulate hormones) as well as a vitamin B complex supplement with my multivitamin and it has really helped me out. Also if it's a cloudy day and I can't get out in the sun I take a Vitamin D3 supplement. I hope this helps in any way. I know postpartum issues can be so debilitating and then having your life public for criticism must not make it any easier 😕 but I love your videos and have always admired your honestly!

And now it's a girl's colour... hell yeah.\n5. it annoys me how there are some people in our small community that always take your words out of proportion and assume whatever. you're always so clear with your opinions, what''s needed by us the viewers is sth as simple as logic. guess not everyone has that....\n6.

2966,"You say how difficult it is for Asian/tan/black girls to find their perfect shade and make it seem easy for white girls to get the perfect shade. I agree to an extent but as a Scottish pale skinned girl (super pale I may add) I've never found my perfect shade. I'm still having to mix two foundations to get a decent colour that somewhat matches me because I find everything is either too pink or yellow toned. It's wonderful that Fenty has created so many shades so that all of us can find something that is hopefully perfect. I shall definitely try it out!

I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food.

The government had shut it down before it was formed as said in the movie and only was formed becauce of Loki. Annnnnnd they already knew of super powered beings from the hulk having existed well before iron man 1, ant man existed, and captain America existed (and was frozen unbeknownst) so they had an idea to find super powered beings around the world and get them on the side of good knowing that the odds that all super beings being friendly is super low. They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings. Then Loki strikes and Thor comes and that's when nick fury reaches out to all those archived super heroes to create the avengers in said movie.

Part of his manifesto is that the whole world is corrupt, that the victims are not that particularly chosen, but that it could be anyone. It would probably be a big thing for him that mostly anyone could be driven to kill in rage if you push them the right way. He could have decided to use Mills for Rage during their chase, that's why he spares his life, he's like yesss, this one will do.. and starts planning how he can get envious at him and drive him to killing.

Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless 💕

3500,"I've never liked PDP, I just don't get the draw. That being said, I find myself for some reason having to defend him not because I support racial slurs, but because of the MASSIVE double standard regarding them and the outright abuse of the DMCA in response to it. \n     The fact of the matter is that the DMCA was written BY monolithic corporations FOR monolithic corporations and they repeatedly misuse it with little concern of negative consequences since it is stacked so unbelievably in their favor. \n    Could this be used to destroy what we know of as Fair Use? Yeah, it could, but ultimately I see that as the force that would finally take DOWN the DMCA as we know it. \n    Europe has much more restrictive ideas of 'Free Speech' than here in the States, and it is true that it's not a free speech issue, legally, when it's solely in the hands of a private corporation (even IF said corporation HOSTS an UNBELIEVABLE amount of speech). But the day the US government comes to censor, and let's be honest that's what 'regulation' means in this context, there will be hell because THAT is a Constitutional violation on our side of the pond.

If you want to talk about it then man up and take some responsibility for what you're talking about.

How do you justify the double standard, is it racism of low expectations where black people are given license to freak out disproportionately to the use of a single word? If it's so offensive, are you or anyone else, going to boycott the hundreds of music artists who use the word constantly, because we are all in the same garden afterall, right?\n\nYou think pewdiepie is responsible for the ad-poclaypse? He was just the catalyst to shift youtube into a television model because that's all corporations know, you even acknowledge they are act like a network.

3514,"I don't think many people put enough effort to comprehend what they're commenting on... and it includes both sides - PDP defenders AS WELL AS his recent critics. Apart from some percent of brainless radical racist idiots, I think most of us agree that the N-word is infamous for a reason - it has a horrible background history and hateful meaning. But for some time now it's also been used in a wide variety of contexts that extend far outside of this word's common definition. \n\nAnd what actually is offensive about it is not the word itself but the context behind it. It became a common sense thing to just not use it to avoid confusion and stop any possible abuse coming from using it. Hence, PDP slipping it out was a really stupid example of lack of self-control where it clearly should step in on literally every word he's saying (considering his non deniable influence on many people). But when you look at the situation he was in and examine the moment of the commented reaction it becomes more and more doubtful if this word in this particular moment had a true racist context. it was clearly offensive and insulting towards the PUBG player but not really that racist in general. \nThus PDP should be smacked for using the word but calling him straight up racist is just an example of reckless hate bandwagon causing the drama to be more exposed than the actual bad word itself.\n\nPeople should be educated why this word is an abuse and why it shouldn't be ever used. All this drama consisting of people actually only throwing insults at PDP is showing that what matters are pitchforks and torches, especially in 'mass vs 1' setting, leaving educational aspect far behind hardly justified rage.

3541,"Honestly, this the first Jim Sterling video I actually disliked (Part of at least). PewDiePie says the N-word on a stream in the heat of the moment (apologized right after) and gets blasted for it. It was wrong on his part and he deserves some flak. But punishment, like what law did he break to make him a criminal. Youtube already cut ties with him as did MakerStudios. Meanwhile, I watch a EtikaWorldNetwork (FYI, He's Black) stream and he saying the N-word all over the place. He jokingly uses the N-word, but also says it in the heat of the moment. Why don't ppl loose their shit over that? Or is it because he's black that he gets a pass? No. It's simply, because PDP is the largest Youtuber, no other reason whatsoever.

Regardless of your personal beliefs about PC culture, we don't use racial slurs for anyone except with the privacy of our own friendship circles that have deemed it okay. Pewdiepie is a youtuber, it's his job. He streams, and makes videos. When he's livestreaming, he is on the job no matter how cool or freeform the job. \nYou do not say that word when you are at your work. Period. Try to apply your arguments to your mum and see how it works for you.\n\nAnd beyond that, if you are so against the N word being considered a racial slur, then advocate for it in a manner with a legitimate argument. Don't go just saying it for the sakes of saying it.

3559,"I fully agree on the Pdp part.\nEither YouTube regulates itself, for example enforcing their community guidelines or just making use of laws, or, and in my opinion more likely, the current YouTube will fail.\n\nAs for why enforcing some guidelines is important:\nIf the CEO of some minor company, let me take Tim Cook as an example because he is in the media from time to time, were to swear on a press conference. The entirety of the Apple shareholders would demand him to step down. Not because the word used was bad, but because his behaviour is inappropriate. Companies working with Apple would be happy as their business partner has some standards and move on.\nOn Youtube however, advertisers (business parterns of Google) see no actions at all! Working with a company that has no standards is to be avoided, or else your shareholders, customers and business parterns will give up on you.\n\nAnother issue is the audience of said channels. They are young and do not know any better. Guess how we got all the screaming and swearing children in voice channels.\nTheir idol is screaming and swearing all the time! It is logical to them to behave the same. The sterotypical 12 year old is co-produced of YouTube not regulating anything. Laissez-faire has failed years ago.\n\nNow that the waves get higher, we see the storm comming.

Personally, I think, as a replacement for Last Week, you should do a bi-weekly or monthly vlog series. I don't want to lose that feel I get from this series or the excitement I have when I see a new upload that just won't be present with a static, talky podcast.\n\nI commend you for making it to the end of this wall of text, and I hope others agree with me.

I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!
",1
4100,"Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything).

He almost seemed uncomfortable in it. It was look big, and didn't seem to fit who he is.\n\nAND, and the way they parted ways-- they should have been instant BFFs.

Not like our American cousins who sugar coat the truth in order not to offend...\n\nI feel as though this could of went down a whole other way, if the guy had given off more of a manly vibe about him. He didn't exactly come across like he either knew what he was supposed to be doing (i.e. naive in dating) or that he just came across as more feminine. Things such as little gestures like head shaking when saying beyoncé and that whole ohh hey gurl ...vibe. Probably instantly put her off. As for her... Well he wasn't exactly trying to find compatibility in terms of sexual connection so the whole thing seemed doomed from the early stages, for me.\n\nThat's just what you guys would call throwing my 2 cents worth in...

So, my friends one day saw the Olympic sized pool in campus and were like HEY! LET'S DO A SWIMMING CLASS!!!\nNo. I said.\nCome on! It'll be fun!\nI know how to swim, no need.\nSam, please, you'll have fun. This will be on of those CV things you can add, right?\nLike the monstrosity that they were, they forced me to sign up. And that's when the horror started. Twice a week, they would drag me screaming to the water. Bless the coach, she was very understanding and was very slow in advancing me, she kept me behind on the others as she slowly tries to break away the fear from me (Which she did, again, bless the coach) and then, that's when they discovered that I really can fucking swim.\nDo you want to know how I can swim but fear the water? My dad threw me in the sea, far away from the beach, with only a floaty jacket thing on me. To teach me how to swim.\nTill this day, my coach still asks for me to join the swimming team, and while I am grateful for her, nope. Just nope.

Everybody is like you, they are all clueless and trying to find new friends so they will be glad you approached them\nI've studied for 4 years now and that are the most important things imo.

Once you look at all the negative publicity he brings with him it's no surprise whatsoever no team wants him. Miami would've signed him, but wait huge Cuban population who hate Kaepernick because of his Castro support ( pretty disgusting, I mean the guy was a genocidal dictator ). Also, the Ravens were set to sign him, and his gf sends out a racist as f tweet that ruined the deal, as Ray Lewis has been attesting to.\nThere are studies that have been done showing the NFL's loss in viewership was directly tied to these anthem protests, so if a player is already bad and does this shit, none of you can act shocked or disgusted when they get cut.\nThe owners have a vested interest in keeping viewership up. Capitalism only cares about making money, it doesn't care about your skin color or your sexuality morons

5731,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.

5751,"the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people. We could use this to shorten the average work week to something like ten hours but capitalism lives off growth and would never allow this. there will always be new jobs until we implement a universal basic income. we could be the new spartans. we could live like kings off the fruits of our technology. sure, some work still needs to be done but not as much as is currently being done. 60% of people in britain believe their job is actually unnecessary.\n\nwhen self driving cars take all the jobs from truck drivers and taxi drivers, capitalism will create new jobs for them or leave them unemployed and in poverty. what if instead we realised that we have less work to do as a society and the same amount of people. implement a UBI and allow people to work less. \n\nhumanity has pushed the frontiers of science and technology for thousands of years. its time to relax and live off the fruits of our labour.\n\nif you ask people what they would do with a universal basic income nearly everyone has an idea of something productive they would do. maybe theyd do charity work or start a business or study. if you ask people what other people would do with a UBI, nearly everyone responds the same theyd just spend it on cigarettes and alcohol. theyre wrong.\n\nCapitalism is not the future and communism is not the only alternative. the time is ripe for a UBI

5762,"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\n\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\n\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population

If I remember correctly they mainly did the jobs that were seen as above the Helots but beneath the Spartans proper, such as a good deal of the merchant work, as well as serving in the army if called upon. In fact if my memory of my undergraduate reading doesn't fail me it was actually possible for these freemen to be elevated into full Spartanhood under very special conditions and with the support of a Spartan citizen.

5767,"22:20 \n\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\n\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \n\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \n\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\n\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\n\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \n\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure.

It wasn't until much later that Sparta got a strong, sophisticated military, perhaps just from trying to live up to their new reputation.  Self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.

5783,"Firstly, in the From Democrats to Kings, Michael Scott narrates a lot of battles throughout the V and IV B.C centuries and also how warfare evolved to something more killing efficient. I don't remember if it was him or someone who was debating on the specific topic of Sparta's declining military prowes, but it was a point that the continous loss of men able to fight and also the inability for the Spartans to change that was responsable for it's eventual decline. I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\n\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks?

Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario – the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi – the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario – Mario turned septic and libertarian – then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi’s identity only comes from what and who he isn’t – without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi.

The world is so unfair for making her feel the same things and struggling with this condition the same way I and many people do. This video was very informative and super accurate, good job girls 👏🏻💕 I still felt hopeless after watching this, like I always do when it comes to dissociation. I just feel like there is no cure for this. Nothing ever works. I feel like I will never feel alive again and I will never get back the contact to myself that I once lost. I don't know who I am, I only know who I once was. But that person in the past is not me anymore. I just wish everything would end and I found myself again.

I went to go talk to a psychologist, but I don't know how to be verbal about my issues bc idk what's wrong. I am soooo confused with how I feel and my parents won't take me to a psychiatrist bc they don't want me on meds. Bc they think that they won't help bc my mom said she took them when she was a child and they made her feel disconnected from the world. But it affects everyone differently. But they don't understand. My mom says it's part of being a teenager and it's all in my head. And idk what to do. Omg I didn't think it was normal to feel this way when you're a teenager but my mom seems to have all the answers. And it drive me fucking mad.

6170,"Hi! I have a question/need advice:\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards?

6171,"I experience derealization because of a major traumatic experience and sometimes it gets so bad where I become basically unresponsive because I'm just so spaced out and it leads to people getting angry at me because I don't respond to them and when I'm so spaced out it can be scary when someone is yelling at me while I feel like nothing is real.

6181,"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening. I'm fine now so don't worry, I'm just curious if that's what it was as I'm trying to learn more about mental health illnesses so I can be more helpful to friends who might go through these thing.

6182,"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x

6183,"Hey, I wanted to share my story if anyone is listening so uhm yeah if you want to read it you can, I just wanted to since I've never talked about it before\n\n\nSo since I was born my mother has had depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social. I'm scared I'm going to develop Asperges, a genetic mental disorder my mum carries. My uncle has it and because of it I've never met him, same with my grandma. Sorry if this is a little weird, but it feels good to let it out.

I experience a few of these on and off occasionally and im ok with dealing with them a lot but when I'm worse especially when I'm panicked in a situation I can't get out of I get more physical things like painful pins and needles around my face and neck and the feeling like my skin crawling, what feels like really violent shivers down my spine,  is this a form of depersonalisation or just a physical manifestation of panic? I've always just called it depersonalisation because it seems like it would be but idk, I've always been curious.\n\nI'd like to try more types therapy though, I want to go back to talk therapy as it helped me a lot, especially with bigger things?  but I don't know if other things are worth trying more for the long term.

6189,"I'm not gonna say I have this stuff, but I tend to have episodes where everything feels like a dream and very distant. For a while I would have small moments of depersonalization, and during school years, I would have up to almost a month at a time or at least most of a week I will/would just have empty busy times. In those times I just go through life without thinking and barely remember what happens when I come out of it. I get really touchy a lot and I have a friend who used to physically latch onto people and when she did that to me, I got stressed and had that distant feeling and that feeling usually meant in a few days I would have those empty periods of time.\nI don't know, though. Just don't attack me, because I'm only saying I have similar experiences and am very paranoid and idk why, but I'm not going to diagnose myself.

6205,"This video made me realize that I have had moments of derealization and depersonalization in the past. Last year, when I was at school, I just felt like I was floating through a dream that never ended. Youtube has helped me feel those emotions again and all of the sudden the feelings would go away! Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel! Thank you so much for making this video, it helped me a lot! \nLots of love!

6426,"BEFORE I GET A MILLION COMMENTS ABOUT IT, YES I KNOW THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T MATCH! It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video. In front of all of my studio lights I couldn't tell but it's very obvious on camera. I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade!

",1
6429,"you said it yourself later in the video- the sponge absorbs most of the product. that's why it took so much foundation- not because of the foundation but because of the sponge. it's also a light to medium coverage foundation, not supposed to be full coverage.

6437,"Hey hey! \nI liked your review and you were honest about your opinion. Not everyone will like everything and that's okay. The foundation is great but it not only matches skin tone but the undertone as well and the one you picked up is a bit warm and you might be on the cooler/pink side. I don't like Sephora's lighting and they have done me in from time to time as well.

U put so much foundation on....of course the other stuff isn't gonna blend correctly. I kinda feel like u are being bIas cuz u seemed a lol shooketh that u weren't invited to the event. But other than that...u talk quite fast
",1
6460,"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized; assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus ; yet don't know that hooded eyes can't have the same cat eye wing angle as almond shape eyes. Or something as simple as foundation . Unless you are certified in the field or know the chemistry behind it, please don't deem a product horrible if it doesn't work for you .Also if a product does work for you , doesn't mean the person who had a harder time with it doesn't know what they are doing . Simply means it's not for them . \n       Sincerely a makeup enthusiast.

",1
6834,"From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic.

I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie.
",-1
6856,"You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better

Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk.
",-1
6861,"Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though

",1
6876,"I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!
",-1
6877,"it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over!
",1
6878,"I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol
",1
6879,"In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster.
",1
6880,"There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown.
",-1
6881,"YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this
",1
6882,"holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something?
",-1
6883,"I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign.

6885,"Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster?
",-1
6886,"Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie?
",1
6887,"Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters.
",1
6888,"Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film.
",-1
6889,"Soooooo, did you like it?
",1
6890,"YES! My biggest problem with most horror movies is how illogically the murderers behave. Why would you toy with your victims in a way that implies there is an audience watching? Unless......are the monsters aware of us, the moviegoers? Is Pennywise's food actually our approval as the audience? Dun dun dun!!!

Or important information needed to be dumped/sniffed from the target email address, website, a particular location, or for whatsoever reason you want to hire a Hacker Or As a parent you might need to monitor what your children are doing on social media and on their personal computers so that they don’t get into trouble.

Time also depends on what exactly you want to hack and how serious you are. Enough time with social engineering is required for hacking. So if you want to bind me in a short time, then just don't contact me because I can't hack within one hour,*sorry*. Basically, time depends on your luck. If its good luck, then it is possible to hack within one hour but, if its in the other way round, it would take few hours.

7323,"It's somewhat important to remember that sending people free stuff is advertising just as much as starting a campaign with commercials and ads and such; and paying people to share your product just by giving it to them can be both _much_ cheaper _and_ more effective than the more traditional techniques. (Even without expectation that you'll tell anyone you got it, the simple fact that people have a natural/social impetus to say thank you for a gift means that shotgunning a bunch of these out to people with audiences, it's probably well worth it to the brand.)\n\nI've encountered concern about the ethics of this sort of advertising--when brand deals, which pay _much_ more, are also a thing, this technique starts to seem pretty dodgy. Especially since it's an appeal to the brand's supposed generosity (which I suppose isn't always fake--you may well simply have a fan at Google who added you to that list, for example); or, more to the point, it's an appeal to the idea that the brand has done _you_ , the creator whom we love, a favor, and thus we should consider supporting them in return: an idea which can be very dishonest when we consider the opportunity cost to a professional content creator of accepting this sort of advertising.\n\nSORRY FOR THE DEPRESSING ECONOMICS DISCUSSION I just feel this is something more people should be aware of, whatever their conclusions about it. :S

When I was 8 I went outside to play one day while my brother and another kid from the neighborhood threw rocks at a hive of yellow jackets. The yellow jackets attacked them and when they ran across the street in my direction I was stung several times. Didn't know it at the time but I was allergic to bee stings, this caused me to swell up bad and be admitted to the hospital. Up until the time I was in high school I had a huge fear of bees and the thought of being stung again. I outgrew it and faced my fear but during the age those kids were it would have been that.

Either Solaire is just being ballsy by reducing his invincibility frames, or he bought an item from a stall prior and it's stuffed up his weight ratio.\n1:28 - Solaire summoned in but the group is AFK. Promptly uses Black Separation Crystal to leave.\n1:50 - Silly Solaire. You cannot hurt someone whilst they're resting at a bonfire. What do you think this is, Dark Souls 2?\n2:02 - No damage taken by Solaire's hits? Dirty 'Cheat Engine' users.\n2:21 - I'm guessing Solaire is farming that Man-Serpent Summoner for its Medicant's Staff? Obviously doesn't get it as we never see Solaire with the Sunlight Shield.\n2:35 - Solaire vs. red invader dual-wielding Avelyns.\n2:48 - Solaire breaks his weapon on phase-2 Darklurker. Feels bad man.\n2:56 - Solaire vs. Aldrich, Devourer of Gods.\n3:04 - Picking on 2 harmless undead? WTF Solaire!\n3:14 - Fighting Marvellous Chester is a bad idea, but I understand. We all love that helm for Fashion Souls.\n3:49 - Solaire vs. Elana, Squalid Queen.\n4:05 - Solaire attempts to turn Sailor Moon towards the Sun's grace, but then stabs the filthy Darkmoon.\n4:16 - Solaire learn to fear the Frostbite build.\n4:30 - Using a Greatbow in a close-range fight? Bad idea.\n4:46 - Another invader dual-wielding Avelyns. They're everywhere!\n4:59 - Stop hitting people resting at bonfires, Solaire!\n5:09 - 3 vs. 1. Solaire spell-cancels for a sneaky hit. Lands a devastating blow on Hashirama at 5:30. Absolutely devastating.\n5:38 - Epic PvP battle between Solaire and a Chaos Blade wielder. Close match, but Chaos Blade wielder forfeits due to too much health drained from her own weapon (20HP each hit adds up quickly).\n6:24 - Praise the Sun!

8749,"Has Science have discovered God?\n\nBased on the Harvey and the Irma hurricanes destructive effect on the state of Texas and the state of Florida plus the raging fires of California we could say that God is real and whenever man says that his laws, here in the United States of America, should be above the laws of God then we all get into big, big trouble.\nFor instance, according to the Bible, God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Therefore, God’s authority of how things should be done on earth is much higher than the authority of President Trump, the United States Congress and the United States Supreme Court of Justice and above the authority of all American voters put together. When non-believers in God, as described by the Bible, atheists, secularists and evolutionists take the Bible out of the public square and out of public teaching the influence of God’s Holy Spirit is greatly diminished within the American population and the United States, like other nations where God’s Ten Commandments are ignored and violated generates many assassins, rapists, thieves and people making false accusations against others.\nFor instance, places where we have people with widespread lack of knowledge of who Jesus and His Apostles were plus their specific teachings such as in the Key West, Florida, the crime index measures the rate of crimes in any area on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the safest areas. This area earns a two on that scale. In other words, 98 percent of areas in United States of America are safer than this one, making it the most dangerous area in Key West and one of the most dangerous in the nation. Moreover, places where Jesus’ teachings are widely ignored such as in Houston Texas, we will find out that Houston’s murder numbers are posted for 2016 and they remain at a five-year high. Records show 302 people were killed 2015, leaving behind families who were ripped apart. You'll find that the occurrence of violent crime in Houston, TX is 135% higher than the average rate of crime in Texas and 159% higher than the rest of the nation. Those crimes are committed because God’s authority is diminished in the hearts and minds of people that are highly unfamiliar with God’s Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-17 and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the New Testament in the Bible

",-1

I'm... starting to think maybe this guy isn't someone I should respect. \nWhatever a writer writes about, the subject matter can be inspired, but ultimately the content of the book is a revealing insight into the mind of the writer... Which means he was writing about 12 year old children having sex, in great detail... he actually planned that shit in advance. \n\nI wonder how many other famous pop culture icons are secretly pedos and  serial kilers. A hell of a lot more than we would think is probably the answer.

The silver works because they know it works, the asthma inhaler works when they are kids when he thinks it's acid, then as an adult when he knows its mostly water it doesn't work.\n\nA similar system was actively used by the citizens of Elm St in Freddy vs. Jason.

This segment of the book is totally left out that's too bad because I've always considered it maybe the creepiest portion of the novel. In conclusion, the novel is simply so massive in its scope and unrelenting horror nastiness that it will never be successfully adapted to film.

People today expect an adaptation to CLING to the source material which shouldn't be the norm. Great video.
",1
9167,"Actually you guys are wrong. A girl did get murdered and grown up Mike Hanlon did found a picture of Georgie near the crime scene. The picture has been missing since Bill and Richie went back to check Georgie's moving and winking picture. Finding this photo is in fact the deciding factor for Mike to believe that IT did returned and called up the others. This is quite important in the book and the picture had driven a lot of flash back so I don't know how you could have missed it if you did read the book.
